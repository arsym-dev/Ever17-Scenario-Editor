1 :
We quickly climbed the stairs.

We were told that it wasn't urgent, but we
still couldn't afford to be careless.

Tsugumi quietly shouldered the heavy toolbox,
climbing higher and higher.

Sara and I followed her while Takeshi and Sora
lagged behind.

[Kid]
Hey, Tsugumi?

I called out to Tsugumi up ahead.


{S3B000}
[Tsugumi]
What?

Tsugumi responded without looking back.

[Kid]
There's something that's been bugging me.


{S3B001}
[Tsugumi]
What?

[Kid]
Why were you eating a hotdog?

I still couldn't figure it out... Tsugumi's
behavior was incomprehensible to me.

Then I hit upon it. It was like she had been
showing off.

But what she said was...


2 :

{S3B002}
[Tsugumi]
Because I wanted to eat a hotdog.

[Kid]
That's it?


{S3B003}
[Tsugumi]
Something wrong with that?

[Kid]
I don't think it's wrong, but...


{S3B004}
[Sara]
"But didn't you think that it might make 
Takeshi angry?"

Sara chimed in with a question of her own.


3 :

{S3B005}
[Tsugumi]
How could I know what he's thinking?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
"I suppose you're right. We didn't know about 
them until right before either."

After that, we fell into silence.

It looked like Takeshi and Sora were having a
low-key conversation behind us.


4 :

{S3B006}
[Tsugumi]
Well...

Tsugumi started to speak suddenly.


{S3B007}
[Tsugumi]
"Maybe I did want to play a trick on him, just 
a little bit."

[Kid]
?


{S3B008}
[Sara]
?

For a second, I didn't know what she was
talking about.

Then I realized she meant the whole hotdog
thing.


5 :

{S3B009}
[Tsugumi]
"Heehee... He's even more stubborn than I 
thought."

Tsugumi gave a rare laugh.

But it was the kind of laugh that would raise
the hair on the back of your neck.


6 :
We finally arrived at Zweiter Stock.

Looking around the floor, everything seemed
normal, but we could hear a hissing sound
coming from somewhere.

We walked toward the sound.


7 :

{S3B010}
[Takeshi]
Yesterday, everything was fine here.


{S3B011}
[Takeshi]
"Why do you think something would go wrong all 
of a sudden?"


{S3B012}
[Sora]
"Well... everything doesn't always go 
according to plan..."


8 :

{S3B013}
[Tsugumi]
"It's probably because you were all running 
around like lunatics."


9 :
[Kid]
Huh?


{S3B014}
[Tsugumi]
You guys were making such a fuss...


{S3B015}
[Tsugumi]
It probably threw LeMU off its axis.


10 :
[Everyone]
...


{S3B016}
[Tsugumi]
Just kidding.


11 :
[Everyone]
.........

Tsugumi's flippant remark had frozen the air
around us.


12 :

{S3B017}
[Tsugumi]
"What's wrong? If you don't hurry, I'll leave 
you behind."


13 :
Tsugumi walked briskly ahead.


14 :
[Kid]
H-hey... What's the matter with her?


{S3B018}
[Sara]
How would I know?


15 :

{S3B019}
[Takeshi]
She probably fell on her head.


16 :

{S3B020}
[Sora]
She really is quite unpredictable...

For a while, all we could do was stand around,
not knowing what to say.


17 :
We had arrived in front of the room making the
strange noise.


18 :

{S3B021}
[Takeshi]
So it is coming from inside the warehouse.


19 :

{S3B022}
[Sora]
"I will run a scan to determine the situation 
inside."


20 :
Saying that, Sora disappeared.


21 :

{S3B023}
[Takeshi]
"The steam in there isn't going to explode if 
we open the door, right?"

Tsugumi fixed her eyes on the door.


22 :

{S3B024}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm...


{S3B025}
[Tsugumi]
It's probably fine.


23 :

{S3B026}
[Takeshi]
How would you know? Do you...?


{S3B027}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just saying what you want to hear.

Sora appeared in front of the door.


24 :

{S3B028}
[Sora]
I have finished the diagnostic.


25 :

{S3B029}
[Sora]
"Atmospheric pressure is normal. No traces of 
toxic gas detected; however, the temperature 
and humidity of the room are rising in 
slight increments."


{S3B030}
[Sora]
"An area of the pipe has ruptured, and there 
is a slight water leak. The water is about 
ten centimeters at its deepest point."


26 :

{S3B031}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*... Exactly as I thought.


27 :

{S3B032}
[Sora]
What?


28 :

{S3B033}
[Tsugumi]
"Nothing. If that's all that's wrong, it 
should be no problem."


29 :

{S3B034}
[Sora]
No, I suppose not...


30 :

{S3B035}
[Takeshi]
"Let's go in. If we fix it, there won't be a 
problem, right?"


{S3B036}
[Sora]
Yes. Please hurry.


31 :
I opened the door.

I looked toward the wall that was making the
hissing sound.

There was a faint crack in the
pressure-regulating pipe, and water was
dancing out of it in a fine mist.


32 :

{S3B037}
[Sara]
Are... Are you sure this is okay?


{S3B038}
[Takeshi]
Maybe...


{S3B039}
[Tsugumi]
"Sure. Something small like this, we can fix in 
a second."

Tsugumi opened up the toolbox and started
spreading a few tools out in front of her.


33 :

{S3B040}
[Takeshi]
What should I do?


{S3B041}
[Tsugumi]
"The pipe is bent a little bit... I'm going to 
clamp a metal sleeve on it. Would you support 
the pipe for me?"


{S3B042}
[Takeshi]
Roger that!


34 :

{S3B043}
[Sara]
What should I do?


35 :

{S3B044}
[Tsugumi]
"On the other side of this... there should be 
a valve attached to this pipe. You see it? I 
want you to loosen that a bit."


36 :

{S3B045}
[Sara]
At your service!


37 :
[Kid]
And what about me?


38 :

{S3B046}
[Tsugumi]
"I'll tell you which tools I need and you pass 
them to me."

[Kid]
Okay.


39 :
We all started working in unison.

We opened and closed a number of valves,
connected and repaired pipes, and welded shut
cracks...


40 :

{S3B047}
[Takeshi]
You seem really used to all this.


{S3B048}
[Tsugumi]
What do you mean?


{S3B049}
[Takeshi]
Welding. Where'd you learn that?


41 :

{S3B050}
[Tsugumi]
You really want to know?


42 :

{S3B051}
[Takeshi]
Uh, well, it's just that...


{S3B052}
[Tsugumi]
"You know, asking meaningless questions is a 
bad habit of yours."

[Takeshi]
.........


43 :

{S3B053}
[Tsugumi]
Satisfied?


44 :

{S3B054}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What does that mean?

[Tsugumi]
.........


{S3B055}
[Takeshi]
Alright. I won't ask anymore.


45 :
[Kid]
.........

Every once in a while, I felt that Tsugumi's
words seemed out of place.

I stole a glance at Tsugumi's expression as I
handed over the pliers.

Of course, her face didn't really tell me
anything...

Sora watched us for a while from the side.


46 :
After a while, an intercom in the corner of the
room sounded.


47 :

{S3B056}
[Takeshi]
What's that? Somebody calling?


{S3B057}
[Sora]
"It's from Tanaka-san. It appears that she is in the 
security office."


48 :

{S3B058}
[Sara]
So Nakkyu is alright?


49 :
[Kid]
That's a relief.


50 :

{S3B059}
[Sora]
"Excuse me, everyone, but Tanaka-san is calling me.
I must be going."


51 :

{S3B060}
[Takeshi]
"Okay, go for it. We should be able to handle 
the rest ourselves."


52 :

{S3B061}
[Sora]
Okay. I'll leave the rest to you.


53 :
Sora approached the intercom and disappeared
as if it had sucked her in.

I knew she could travel instantly, but... it
was still an odd sight.


54 :

{S3B062}
[Tsugumi]
"Kid? I'm all set here, so please work on the 
valves for me."

[Kid]
Huh? Sure. No problem.


55 :
I moved over to the area by the pipes that she
indicated.


{S3B063}
[Tsugumi]
First, take that blue valve and...


56 :
(What?)


57 :
(Oh, what was that?)

For a second, I saw something.


{S3B064}
[Tsugumi]
Now twist the red valve...

The intercom continued to ring, and the hissing
sound of the steam persisted.

(That feeling I just had... that was like
before...)

(I know! It was like when I was going to the
conference room from the kiosk this morning.)


{S3B065}
[Tsugumi]
Now, Sara, wait just a bit.


{S3B066}
[Sara]
Okay, I'm ready~


{S3B067}
[Tsugumi]
"Kid, turn the valves in the order I told 
you."

[Kid]
...


58 :

{S3B068}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, Kid, are you listening?

[Kid]
"Huh? Yeah, I got it. Sorry. The blue and then 
the red, right?"


59 :

{S3B069}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah. Loosen them, then shut them again.


60 :
I set to work on the blue valve in front of me.

I was supposed to loosen it...

And right then, it happened again‡L


61 :
The inside of my head went all white.

It felt like my consciousness was whisked off
somewhere else.

(Wh-what was that?)

An image flashed at the back of my mind, and
it felt like my brain was being hammered by
light.

It would stop and start, stop and start.

Boxes falling and shattering to the floor.

Massive amounts of water cascading down.

And then...


62 :
[Kid]
.........

I remembered losing all power to stand and
crumpling right there on the spot.

(That was...)

(That was......)

(It can't be...!)


63 :

{S3B070}
[Takeshi]
Hey! What's the matter? Hey!

Takeshi shook my shoulders, bringing me back
from wherever I'd been.


64 :
[Kid]
Takeshi...?


65 :

{S3B071}
[Takeshi]
It's me, Kid. You okay?

[Kid]
Takeshi... Trouble...


66 :

{S3B072}
[Takeshi]
Huh?

[Kid]
"If we stay here, there's going to be 
trouble... We have to escape... Now..."

I coughed the words out deliriously.

[Kid]
"Things are going to fall... and water will 
flood in... and someone will get really hurt..."


67 :

{S3B073}
[Takeshi]
"What're you talking about...? You aren't 
making sense."

[Kid]
Right now... We have to escape!

I felt like I was filling up with fear and
panic.


{S3B074}
[Takeshi]
Calm down! Just calm down!


{S3B075}
[Tsugumi]
Out of the way.


68 :
[Kid]
.........

My left cheek burned like it had been scalded.


69 :

{S3B076}
[Tsugumi]
Calm down.

[Kid]
......

Pressing my hand on my hurting face, I stood up.

The pounding of my heart finally got under
control.


70 :

{S3B077}
[Tsugumi]
You've done enough.

Saying that, Tsugumi pointed to a corner of the
room.


{S3B078}
[Tsugumi]
Go over there and sit quietly.

[Kid]
What?


71 :

{S3B079}
[Tsugumi]
"You don't get it? I'm saying you're in the 
way."

[Kid]
.........


{S3B080}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, that's a little harsh, don't you think? I 
mean, he's probably tired, that's all."


72 :

{S3B081}
[Tsugumi]
You be quiet.


{S3B082}
[Tsugumi]
"Listen. At times like this, people like him 
are a liability."


{S3B083}
[Tsugumi]
He's going to make a costly mistake.

[Kid]
.........


73 :

{S3B084}
[Tsugumi]
"You don't want to cause an accident here, do 
you?"


{S3B085}
[Takeshi]
Well, that makes sense, but...


74 :

{S3B086}
[Tsugumi]
"Now you know what I mean. Get out of the way. 
We'll get somebody else to do this."

[Kid]
Alright...


75 :
I walked meekly to the corner.


76 :
.........

After that, the work went smoothly... and
finally, we succeeded in getting everything
back to normal.

What I had seen hadn't been real.

Thankfully, my predictions had been off.


77 :
With the repairs finished, everyone left the
room, and I was in the warehouse alone.

I wondered what had been going on in my mind
before.

While everything had all turned out alright,
it bothered me to no end.

Yesterday‡Lin the generator room‡Land then
that... I wondered what was wrong with me.

I was still without my memory.

I couldn't even find any of the pieces.

(But maybe...)

I thought that maybe the crazy flashes that
kept occurring had something to do with my
lost memory.

(Maybe I'm closer to getting my memory
back...?)

I floated around the warehouse thinking about
it.

Suddenly, I noticed that there was another door
deeper in the corner of the room.

There appeared to be another room on the other
side of the wall.

The door was open, as if it were inviting me
in.


78 :
It was a tiny, tiny room.

Inside, the room was dimly lit, and it smelled
damp and moldy.

The lights were off, and closing the door made
it even darker. I could just make out the
interior of the room.

The wall looked cold and sturdy. The room was
covered with cables and pipes.

I imagined that the room was used for storing
equipment used in the warehouse.

The far wall had a small, square window.


...My mind felt all foggy.

Maybe I was just fatigued like Takeshi said.

A lot had happened over the last three days. I
had heard a lot and thought about a lot of
things.

(I don't know what it is... but I feel so
sluggish...)


79 :
I sat down in a corner of the room and hugged
my knees.

Looking up, I saw moonlight streaming in
through the window.

It was warm, full light.


80 :
I noticed that the walls of the room were made
of concrete.

As I sat with my back against the cold wall, I
stared up at the full moon shining in from
outside the window.

The moon was far away.

The broad night sky was contained in that
little square space.

The bluish shadows of the moonlight crawled
slowly across the gray walls.

I looked at the moon and its shadows, and I let
out a sigh in the darkness.

I didn't want to think about anything.

I pretended not to notice the freezing
coldness.

The room had a very small bed.

The sheets were pulled tight. There wasn't a
single wrinkle or even a speck of dust.

Next to the bed lay a chair with all of
the sharp edges rounded off.

One of the chair's legs was bent off in an
unnatural direction.

The door was closed. It was a steel door with
no knob.


81 :
I felt eyes upon me from the corner of the
ceiling.

A sharp, intense pair of eyes piercing my
body.

I couldn't see the body belonging to the eyes,
but a harsh laugh rang loudly in my ears.

Next to the lens, a red light was on.

The red light was shining as if it was cutting off
the corner of the ceiling.


Suddenly, I heard the sobbing voice of someone
behind me.

Someone was crying on the other side of the
wall.


82 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B087}
{16:0x}Ouch... Ouch...{16:1}

{16:4}

83 :
The small voice of a girl echoed in the
darkness.

And then I heard...


84 :
Whack!


85 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B088}
{16:0x}Shut up! Quit whining!{16:1}

{16:4}

86 :
It was the gruff voice of a man ringing out.

I suspected that the girl had been hit. It
sounded like she had fallen on the hard
concrete and was crying even harder.


87 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B089}
{16:0x}Owwww! It hurts!{16:1}

{16:4}

88 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B090}
{16:0x}Help... Someone...{16:1}

{16:4}

89 :
I covered my ears with my hands and shook my
head.


90 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B091}
{16:0x}I'm sorry, I'm sorry‡L{1}
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry‡L{16:1}

{16:4}

91 :
Still, the girl's cries of pain didn't stop.

As if trying to escape, I crawled across the
floor to the opposite corner of the room and
curled up.

The moon's light was bright.

I covered myself with a blanket as if to hide
and closed my eyes.

The girl just cried and cried.


92 :
Gong! Gong!


93 :
Gong! Gong!


94 :
Thud!

...I wondered what that sound could be.

I didn't want to think about it anymore.

Even if I closed my eyes, even if I plugged my
ears, the image of the girl struggling on the
floor jumped back into my mind.


95 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B092}
{16:0x}Ouch... Owwwww...{16:1}

{16:4}

96 :
The voice gradually got weaker and faded.

Finally, it disappeared completely...

In the silence, only a muffled sob echoed
hollowly.

The air in the room was so dank and stale that
it felt heavy and strange on the skin.


97 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B093}
{16:0x}Help me...{16:1}

{16:4}

98 :
I heard a feeble voice.


99 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B094}
{16:0x}Help... Help me...{16:1}

{16:4}

100 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B095}
{16:0}It's all your fault!{16:1}

101 :
The sudden curses of the man drowned out the
girl's voice.


102 :

{1}{1}

{S3B096}
{16:0}All of this is just the way you wanted it.{16:1}

{S3B097}
{16:0}Right? You best fess up to all of it.{16:1}

{S3B098}
{16:0}You knew from the start that{1}
things would turn out like this...{16:1}

103 :
[Kid]
NO! I didn't know!


104 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B099}
{16:0}Liar! So why did you run away?{16:1}

105 :
[Kid]
I didn't run away!


106 :

{1}{1}{1}


{S3B100}
{16:0}No, you ran away.{16:1}

{S3B101}
{16:0}You left that girl and ran away.{16:1}

107 :
[Kid]
No... I... I promised...


108 :

{1}{1}

{S3B102}
{16:0}And you broke it.{16:1}

{S3B103}
{16:0}Or maybe you always meant to break it?{16:1}


109 :
[Kid]
No...


110 :

{1}{1}{1}


{S3B104}
{16:0}You bought happiness for yourself.{1}{16:1}

{16:0}You traded it for that girl's life...{1}{16:1}

{16:0}Hahahaha...{16:1}

{16:4}

111 :
[Kid]
"No... No... No... No... No... 
No... No... No... No..."


112 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B105}
{16:0x}Yeah, I promise.{16:1}

{16:4}

113 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B106}
{16:0x}To wait like a good kid until you come for me.{16:1}

{16:4}

114 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B107}
{16:0x}I'll wait... like a good girl...{16:1}

{16:4}

115 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{S3B108}
{16:0x}I'll wait... forever...{16:1}

{16:4}

116 :
[Kid]
...NO!

I shouted and grabbed the chair lying on the
floor with both hands.

I took the chair, as if to scare away a ghost,
and pounded it on the wall.


117 :
Thud!

Wildly, I put all of my limited strength into
it... Over and over...


118 :
Thud!


119 :
Thud!


120 :
Thud!

The chair bent awkwardly and scraped against
the dented wall.

Outside the window... the moonlight shined far
away...

[Kid]
Damn you!

I took the chair and threw it at the moon with
all my strength.


121 :
‡LCrash!

The moon scattered like fireworks, shattering
to pieces.


122 :
[Kid]
I'll kill you.

Saying that, I threw my body into the steel
door.


123 :
Bang... Bang... Bang... Bang...

The door wouldn't budge.

But I didn't give up.

If I had to pulverize my body, I was still
going to open that door.


124 :
Bang... Bang... Bang... Bang...


125 :
Bang... Bang... Bang... Bang...


126 :
Bang... Bang... Bang... Bang...

I hurled myself against the door again and
again.

The rage I felt made my blood boil and my body
shake with fury.

Something hot and sticky flowed from near my
temple.

Every time I crashed into the door, a shock of
pain ran through my body.

I thought that my shoulder might already be
broken.


127 :
Bang... Bang... Bang... Bang...

A dull sound echoed in the darkness endlessly.


128 :

{S3B109}
[???]
What are you doing?

Suddenly, the door opened...

White light poured into my eyes.

[Kid]
Ah... Ah... Ungh...

Tears overflowed in my eyes and dripped down.


129 :
Through my blurred vision, I could make out
Sara.

Sara stood surrounded by the bright light, her
hands outstretched to me.


130 :
Finally, my consciousness was sucked into the
light.

Powerless, I slumped to the floor, lying there.

My body felt heavy like lead, like it would
sink into the floor.


131 :
The next thing I knew, I was on a bed.

The ceiling was so white that it was slightly
blinding...

It smelled of disinfectant...

Was it the... infirmary?


{S3B110}
[???]
Are you awake now?

A shadow passed above me on the bed.


132 :
It was Y¤u.

Déjà vu...

No, it was something that I had actually
experienced before.

Two days before, when I woke up on the first
day, Y¤u was at my side...

[Kid]
Where is Sara...?


{S3B111}
[Y¤u]
Who knows? Probably resting somewhere.


133 :

{S3B112}
[Y¤u]
"I just replaced her a little bit ago. She 
looked after you the whole time until then."

[Kid]
I see...


134 :
I took both hands out from the blanket and
stared dreamily at my palms.

The countless wrinkles etched there...
intertwining, reaching out like the branches
of a tree in complicated patterns...

The pinkish skin... and buried deeper, the
slightly blue veins...

And... five fingers...

Five on the left, five on the right, and ten in
total. The same as always.

My lost finger still hadn't come back to me
yet.

There was still the deep scar on my left thumb.

Like always, I gently ran my pinky over the scar.


Like always?

(I see. Maybe this is a habit of mine.)

Strangely, that fact had penetrated naturally
into my mind.

But...

I wondered when, where, and how I had injured
my thumb.

Maybe the scar held some kind of clue to
help me remember my past.

As I traced the wound with my pinky, it caused
a slight stinging pain that tickled a little
bit.

I was finally feeling completely calmed down.


135 :

{S3B113}
[Y¤u]
What happened?

Y¤u poured me a cup of freshly brewed coffee,
handed it to me, and sat down next to my bed.

I took the coffee. After a sip, I started to
explain.


136 :
.........

......

...


137 :

{S3B114}
[Y¤u]
I see...


{S3B115}
[Y¤u]
"So that little room and the room that you 
were in before were similar somehow?"

[Kid]
Probably.


{S3B116}
[Y¤u]
"Listening to that, it sounds like a sickroom 
or isolation ward somewhere."

[Kid]
Sickroom?


138 :

{S3B117}
[Y¤u]
"You've probably been hospitalized before 
somewhere."

[Kid]
...


139 :

{S3B118}
[Y¤u]
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but...


{S3B119}
[Y¤u]
Kid, maybe you've had the same...


140 :

{S3B120}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, maybe you've lost your memory or had 
violent fits repeatedly before."


{S3B121}
[Y¤u]
"So maybe you were detained in a sickroom with 
a tiny window like that..."

Y¤u touched on the harsh reality of the
situation, yet chose her words with care.


141 :

{S3B122}
[Y¤u]
"Of course, it's not for sure or anything. 
It's just one possibility."


{S3B123}
[Y¤u]
"You probably had a waking dream... That is a 
possibility too."

[Kid]
I... I was dreaming.


{S3B124}
[Y¤u]
While you were awake, though.


142 :
Finally, Y¤u gave me an easy to understand
explanation about the connectedness of
memories and dreams.

According to Y¤u, dreams and memory were
clearly deeply related, but not everything
seen in a dream was something experienced in
reality.

In other words, something had set off my
hallucination, but...

That alone didn't mean that I really had been
held in a sickroom.


Dreams could often appear as symbols of
something else.

So what I had seen earlier might have been
caused by my repressed memories.

In any case, there was no way to be sure of
anything.

And I still hadn't gotten my memory back.

I felt that my experience in a sickroom or
somewhere like one was as unreal as a strange
small animal that might appear in a dream.

(Maybe it was just a dream.)

At some point, I had become sure of it.

I felt sure that it was just my mind
playing a nasty trick on me.


143 :
Y¤u stood from beside the bed.


144 :

{S3B125}
[Y¤u]
"Okay. For now, shall we go to check it out 
one more time?"

[Kid]
Go check what?


145 :

{S3B126}
[Y¤u]
That little room. To set the record straight.

Y¤u held out her hands out to me.


{S3B127}
[Y¤u]
"You might find a clue to help you jog your 
memory and get it back."

[Kid]
...

I thought that was unlikely.

(I know that was just my mind playing tricks
on me.)

I was convinced that there was no connection
between that room and my memory.

Even so, I had to agree to go.

If she was willing to take me, I couldn't
turn her down.

I took Y¤u's hands and got up from the bed.

It only made sense, but her hands felt a lot
different from Sara's.


146 :
The inside of the little room was in shambles.

I was amazed that I could have made that much
of a mess. That was how terrible it was.

I didn't think that even if you compressed all
of the world's poltergeists into that itty-bitty
space they could have done much more.


All I could do was stand there with my jaw on
the floor as Y¤u said...


147 :

{S3B128}
[Y¤u]
You did this?

She was saying it as if to make sure.


148 :

{S3B129}
[Y¤u]
And? What was it we were going to...?

[Kid]
Huh?


{S3B130}
[Y¤u]
"If I remember correctly... You came into the 
room and sat on the floor, right?"

[Kid]
Y-yeah...


149 :

{S3B131}
[Y¤u]
Whereabouts?

[Kid]
About here, I think.

I pointed to the area around Y¤u's feet.


{S3B132}
[Y¤u]
What about the door?

[Kid]
The door?


150 :

{S3B133}
[Y¤u]
I'm asking whether the door was shut or not.

[Kid]
Uh... I shut it, I think.

[Kid]
"After the door shut, I wanted to escape and 
started throwing myself against the door..."

I closed the door as I answered.


151 :
Just like before, the room was thrown into
darkness.

The only source of light was the moonlight
pouring through the little window...

(What? Moonlight?)


{S3B134}
[Y¤u]
I can't see anything like this.

Y¤u grasped around in the dark with her hands.

I could see everything perfectly.


152 :

{S3B135}
[Y¤u]
Where's the light switch?

Y¤u walked along the wall looking for the
switch, sometimes tripping on plastic boxes
scattered on the floor.

Y¤u's body gave off a faint light.

Every time she took a step, a faint
streak-like image followed her.

It was like the flame of a candle flickering
in a thick mist.


153 :
Light shone down from the ceiling.


{S3B136}
[Y¤u]
"Geez. Can you believe they're still using 
electronic fossils like this these days?"

Y¤u muttered that as she stared at the light
switch.


154 :

{S3B137}
[Y¤u]
"They should spend money on places like this 
even if the customers won't see them."


{S3B138}
[Y¤u]
"It's because they cut corners in places like 
this that they get accidents..."

[Kid]
.........


155 :

{S3B139}
[Y¤u]
That's not important right now.


156 :
Y¤u whipped around.

Then, scouring the room, she said...


157 :

{S3B140}
[Y¤u]
By the way...


158 :

{S3B141}
[Y¤u]
...Where's the window?


159 :
There wasn't a single window in the whole room.


Thinking about it, it made sense.

Nobody would fork over the cash for a little
window with special pressure-resistant glass
in a little storage room stuck on the side of
a warehouse.

I looked around for the moonlight that had been
there until a second ago.

There was no moon.

I wondered if it was because I had shattered
it.

But that wasn't it.

What I had mistaken for a window was... just a
little square hole.


160 :

{S3B142}
[Y¤u]
Is this the window?


{S3B143}
[Y¤u]
You're saying you thought this was a window?


161 :
Y¤u followed my eyes, then went and stood in
front of the square hole.

I went over beside her and looked up at the
hole.

The hole was bordered by a steel frame.

It was about the same size as a coin locker.

It was about 50 centimeters on each side.


There was a door on the hole.

I might have broken it, but the door was bent
completely and hung loose at a hinge on the
side of the hole.

The hole was more than an empty space.

A bunch of colored wiring, something like an
integrated circuit board, some kind of plug,
and something like a small lever were all
packed into it.

[Kid]
What is this?


162 :
I had no idea what it was.


{S3B144}
[Y¤u]
It's probably an inverter unit or something.

[Kid]
Inverter unit?


163 :

{S3B145}
[Y¤u]
"To change the AC power that comes from the 
generator into DC..."


{S3B146}
[Y¤u]
"It's a mechanism for changing the electrical 
current into one that the tools in this 
warehouse can use."


{S3B147}
[Y¤u]
"That means this device controls those 
functions."

[Kid]
I see...

Everything she was saying was like gibberish
to me, but I nodded.


164 :

{S3B148}
[Y¤u]
Or to be more precise, it WAS that.

[Kid]
Huh?


{S3B149}
[Y¤u]
That WAS the inverter unit.


{S3B150}
[Y¤u]
It looks broken now...


165 :

{S3B151}
[Y¤u]
I have no idea who broke it, but...


166 :
Y¤u said it straight-faced and without looking
at me.

I reached out to touch the inverter unit thing.


It was a little bit warm.

Or maybe I had it backwards.

Maybe I knew that it was warm before I touched
it.

So I had wanted to make sure by touching it...


167 :
In the end, we really didn't learn anything.

No... But...

But it did seem like something was trying to
move... at least to me.

It felt like...

It felt like someone inside me was tossing and
turning in his sleep.
