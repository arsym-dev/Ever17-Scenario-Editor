1 :
[Kid]
Y¤u!

[Kid]
Hey! Y¤u!

It was strange... I thought that maybe she
wasn't on that floor.

Just then, Sora's voice came to me from the
voice converter.


2 :

{S3A274}
[Sora]
Kid-san, it's me, Sora.


{S3A275}
[Sora]
I know where Tanaka-san is. She is fine, of course.

[Kid]
Huh? Where is she?


{S3A276}
[Sora]
Zweiter Stock. In the security office.

[Kid]
Security office? Why is she there again?


{S3A277}
[Sora]
"I don't know. Tanaka-san contacted me about her 
whereabouts."

[Kid]
"I got it. I'll go to the warehouse as 
well then."


{S3A278}
[Sora]
No, that will not be necessary.

[Kid]
Why not?


{S3A279}
[Sora]
"Fortunately, to the extent that I have been 
able to investigate, there was no major 
damage."

Sora added that there were enough people to do
the required work.


{S3A280}
[Sora]
"It would be better for you to go to Tanaka-san's 
location."

[Kid]
To where Y¤u is?


{S3A281}
[Sora]
Yes... Something is strange there.

[Kid]
Strange?


{S3A282}
[Sora]
I can't say for sure... but I sense something.


{S3A283}
[Sora]
"So I think that someone should go 
investigate."

[Kid]
"Wouldn't it be better if you went instead of 
me?"

If something was strange, I didn't know what
I could do.


{S3A284}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry. Unfortunately, now I must go to 
the control room."

[Kid]
Control room? Is something else wrong?


{S3A285}
[Sora]
"Uh... No... I have to do a little maintenance 
on LeMMIH..."

[Kid]
I see.


{S3A286}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry... but do you think you can manage 
it for me?"

[Kid]
Sure. I don't have anything better to do.

[Sora]
...

[Kid]
"I'm off to check on Y¤u. The security office, 
right?"


{S3A287}
[Sora]
Yes. Thank you.


3 :
I climbed to the second floor via the
emergency stairs.


4 :
I called to Y¤u via the intercom on the side
of the security office door.

[Kid]
Y¤u? It's me. Can I come in?


{S3A288}
[Y¤u]
Huh!? Kid...?

After a bit, the door opened.


5 :

{S3A289}
[Y¤u]
What's up? What are you doing here?

Y¤u was unable to hide her surprise...

Sora was right. Strange might have been the
word for it.

[Kid]
Sora told me to come.


6 :

{S3A290}
[Y¤u]
Sora?

[Kid]
Y-yeah. Uh... She... Um...

[Kid]
"She said... that something was strange and 
that she wanted me to take a look..."

I couldn't think of a better way to put it and
blurted out the truth.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Uh, is this a bad time?

Y¤u slumped her shoulders as if defeated and
heaved out a sigh.


7 :

{S3A291}
[Y¤u]
Oh well. I guess that's how it goes...


{S3A292}
[Y¤u]
"If you think about it, Sora has ears 
everywhere."

[Kid]
.........


8 :

{S3A293}
[Y¤u]
Well, quit standing there. Come on in.

[Kid]
Uh, alright...


9 :

{S3A294}
[Y¤u]
You want some coffee?


10 :
I followed Y¤u into the room.

It smelled like hot coffee.

In a corner of the room was an ancient siphon
coffee machine percolating up dark liquid.

Y¤u offered me a chair, and I sat down.

She turned to the coffee maker to pour coffee.


[Kid]
What are you up to in here?

I asked Y¤u that bluntly as I leaned back in
the chair.


{S3A295}
[Y¤u]
I'm looking into something.

[Kid]
Looking into something?

White steam curled into the air from where she
was pouring the coffee.

[Kid]
"Is this something that you have to hide from 
everyone?"

I thought it came out a little too accusatory.

Maybe I was a little peeved that she was
hiding something from us.


11 :

{S3A296}
[Y¤u]
Here's your coffee.

She turned back toward me with a white cup in
each hand.

She handed one to me.


{S3A297}
[Y¤u]
It's hot, so be careful.

[Kid]
Oh, thanks...

A white cup. White steam. Only the liquid
inside was black.

LeMU's logo was printed on the cup.


12 :

{S3A298}
[Y¤u]
Well... Where should I start...?

Y¤u sat down next to me and took a sip of her
coffee.

Then she gradually started to talk.


13 :

{S3A299}
[Y¤u]
"I told you before, right? About why I got 
this job at LeMU..."


{S3A300}
[Y¤u]
"I'm looking for clues about my father, who 
disappeared."

I nodded.


{S3A301}
[Y¤u]
"He went missing seventeen years ago, and I 
came hoping to find a hint as to why."

[Kid]
"You said that the last place he was seen was 
in LeMU, right?"

[Kid]
Oh. Are you investigating that...?


14 :

{S3A302}
[Y¤u]
Yes...

Y¤u nodded and shifted the cup to her other
hand.


{S3A303}
[Y¤u]
Information about my father.

[Kid]
.........


{S3A304}
[Y¤u]
It was seventeen years ago...


{S3A305}
[Y¤u]
They say there was a big accident here.


15 :
[Kid]
Accident?


16 :

{S3A306}
[Y¤u]
I don't really know that much about it.


{S3A307}
[Y¤u]
"Even looking at old news clippings, I wasn't 
able to gather much information."

[Kid]
What do you mean?


{S3A308}
[Y¤u]
"The cause of the accident, specific damage, 
what happened afterward... All the coverage was 
vague..."


{S3A309}
[Y¤u]
"I figure that the media didn't really know 
the details about what happened either."


17 :

{S3A310}
[Y¤u]
"Somebody or something powerful clamped down 
on information."

[Kid]
Hmmm. That's interesting...


{S3A311}
[Y¤u]
"An accident seventeen years ago, shrouded in 
mystery."


{S3A312}
[Y¤u]
"And my father, who disappeared seventeen years 
ago."


{S3A313}
[Y¤u]
"He worked here until right before the 
accident."


{S3A314}
[Y¤u]
"I can guess some of what happened from 
what we already know..."

[Kid]
"You think that the accident had something to 
do with the disappearance of your father...?"


18 :

{S3A315}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


19 :

{S3A316}
[Y¤u]
"I thought that here... That in LeMMIH, there 
would be some trace... That's why I came."


20 :

{S3A317}
[Y¤u]
"But since I started working, I haven't had any 
time to look into it..."


21 :

{S3A318}
[Y¤u]
"I couldn't even get close to LeMMIH's 
database."


22 :

{S3A319}
[Y¤u]
I guess it makes sense. I was pretty naïve.

The chair squeaked as Y¤u slumped back in it.

She just stared at the ceiling.


23 :

{S3A320}
[Y¤u]
"But... But... you know what? Opportunity 
knocked."

[Kid]
Opportunity...

[Kid]
You... You don't mean this accident?


{S3A321}
[Y¤u]
Yup.

Y¤u placed the cup next to the console.


{S3A322}
[Y¤u]
Now I have access to LeMMIH.


{S3A323}
[Y¤u]
"Thanks to the accident, I've been able to 
get a step closer to my goal."

[Kid]
.........


24 :

{S3A324}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I suppose it has also put my life in 
danger, but..."

Y¤u joked, shrugging her shoulders.

[Kid]
"I'll ask you one more time, but did you have 
to keep it all secret?"


25 :

{S3A325}
[Y¤u]
That's a toughie.


{S3A326}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, I work here, but I don't have any 
authority. It's just a part-time gig..."


{S3A327}
[Y¤u]
"Taking advantage of this accident to gain 
access to secret information in LeMU."


{S3A328}
[Y¤u]
Normally, you might call this...

[Kid]
A kind of looting, maybe?


26 :

{S3A329}
[Y¤u]
"That's right. Stealing information. It's a 
pretty decent crime."


27 :

{S3A330}
[Y¤u]
"But I suppose there was no way I could have 
kept it hidden."


{S3A331}
[Y¤u]
"Sora knows everything that goes on relating 
to LeMMIH."

[Kid]
"I think she would understand your situation 
if you explained it to her."


28 :

{S3A332}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm... I wonder about that.

Y¤u growled as she put the cup to her lips.

I took a sip of coffee too.

It was super bitter and super thick.

[Kid]
So did you find anything out?


29 :

{S3A333}
[Y¤u]
That... That's the problem.


30 :
Tap, tap, tap...

Saying that, Y¤u started tapping on the
keyboard.

One of the monitors on the wall shifted from
footage of an observation camera to an image
of a computer desktop.

In the middle of it, one window was open.

Y¤u explained as she stared at the screen.


{S3A334}
[Y¤u]
"This is the authorization screen to connect 
to the network."

[Kid]
Authorization screen?


{S3A335}
[Y¤u]
"This is where the system assesses the user 
for proper authorization."

[Kid]
I see...

I felt like I kind of got it, but not really...


{S3A336}
[Y¤u]
"I'm attempting to connect to LeMMIH's C 
level... meaning I'm trying to access 
classified information."


{S3A337}
[Y¤u]
"But if anyone could easily access important 
data, it would be a security disaster, right?"

[Kid]
Probably.


{S3A338}
[Y¤u]
"That's why there's a screen where the 
computer asks, 'Hey, who's trying to look at 
this?'"

As she spoke, Y¤u used the mouse to
click on the box for 'Name'.

Inside the box were written the words 'YUKIE
TANAKA'.


{S3A339}
[Y¤u]
"Of course, there's no way I could access the 
system using my name, so I'm using someone 
else's name to get me in."


{S3A340}
[Y¤u]
But anyone might think to try that, right?

[Kid]
I suppose so.


{S3A341}
[Y¤u]
"Obviously, the people who programmed this 
aren't stupid. So, to prevent false 
authorization, they have methods 
to check people's identities."


{S3A342}
[Y¤u]
"The screen then says, 'If you really are Tanaka 
Yukie, please show me your password.'"

Y¤u then used the mouse to circle around the
box for 'Password'.

It was still blank.


31 :
[Kid]
And what about the password?


32 :

{S3A343}
[Y¤u]
I'm working on that right now.

[Kid]
What? You don't know it?


33 :

{S3A344}
[Y¤u]
I don't know it.

[Kid]
So you haven't looked up anything yet?


{S3A345}
[Y¤u]
"It's not that I haven't... I haven't been able 
to. I haven't been able to get in..."

[Kid]
So you're stuck...


34 :

{S3A346}
[Y¤u]
Yup... Stuck.

Y¤u nodded and gave a big sigh.

.........


35 :
Tap, tap, tap...

After a second's pause, Y¤u was back tapping
on the keyboard.

There was nothing for me to do. I just sat
there, watching Y¤u do her thing.

From her fingertips, a password was entered
into the input field.

36 :
Tap, tap, tap...

'*

*

*

*

*

*

*

*'

The digits she typed in were blocked out by '*'
so that anybody watching wouldn't know what
the word was.


37 :
Tap!

Y¤u finished her input and hit the Enter key.


38 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

But Y¤u immediately tapped in another line of
letters.


39 :
Tap, tap, tap...

'*

*

*

*

*

*

*

*'


40 :
Tap!


41 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'


42 :
Tap, tap, tap...

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u?


{S3A347}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
I was just wondering, who is 'Tanaka Yukie'?

[Kid]
"Looking at the name, I was wondering, is she a 
relative or something?"


{S3A348}
[Y¤u]
She's my mom.

[Kid]
Your mom worked here?


{S3A349}
[Y¤u]
"Works. She is working here. As in the present 
tense."


43 :
[Kid]
Hey. Your mom researches archaeology, right?

[Kid]
"You said something about it yesterday I 
think."


{S3A350}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. So what?

Y¤u answered, her eyes still glued to the
computer.


44 :
[Kid]
Then your mom was a programmer too.


{S3A351}
[Y¤u]
No, she's an archaeologist.

[Kid]
Huh?


{S3A352}
[Y¤u]
What's the problem?

Y¤u fired the question at me as she continued
to do battle with the computer.


45 :
[Kid]
"But archaeology has nothing to do with theme 
parks, right?"


{S3A353}
[Y¤u]
My thoughts exactly.


{S3A354}
[Y¤u]
"But I figure that LeMU could probably offer 
her a lot more money than some small 
university research department with next to no 
budget."

[Kid]
"Is LeMU doing some kind of archaeological 
research?"


{S3A355}
[Y¤u]
Well, it's pretending to at the very least.

[Kid]
?


{S3A356}
[Y¤u]
"It seems like they're doing a survey related 
to the ruins of the Lemurian continent."


46 :
[Kid]
Lemurian continent?

That reminded me, Sora had said that LeMU had
been named after a continent called Lemuria.


On Dritter Stock, there was an attraction called
the 'Lemurian Ruins'...


{S2B190}
[Y¤u]
"Lemuria is the phantom continent that is said 
to have existed from 200 million to 50 million 
years B.C."


{S2B191}
[Y¤u]
"On it thrived an advanced civilization that 
was more advanced than what we have today, but 
it just slipped down to the bottom 
of the ocean overnight."

Y¤u recited it off so fluently that it sounded
like she was reading from a textbook.


{S2B192}
[Y¤u]
"There are some scholars that contend that 
this continent was the origin of mankind."


{S2B193}
[Y¤u]
"But what could they be talking about? 
That could never happen."

[Kid]
You don't believe it?


{S2B194}
[Y¤u]
"Of course not. Archaeologically and 
geologically, the idea has no basis."


{S2B195}
[Y¤u]
"The more real research is conducted, the more 
the theory is shot full of holes... It's no 
longer a legitimate field of study."

[Kid]
You sure know a lot about it.


{S3A357}
[Y¤u]
Well, I AM majoring in archaeology.

[Kid]
Oh, you are...?

Y¤u studying archaeology... It just didn't click.



47 :

{S3A358}
[Y¤u]
"Near the end of the 20th century, some 
oceanic ruins were discovered near Okinawa, 
right?"


{S3A359}
[Y¤u]
"Leiblich Pharmaceuticals spread rumors that 
these ruins were somehow evidence of the 
existence of Lemuria."


{S3A360}
[Y¤u]
"They've poured loads of cash into the 
archaeological survey of the seafloor."


{S3A361}
[Y¤u]
I have no idea what the company is up to.

[Kid]
Your mom was involved in that project too?


{S3A362}
[Y¤u]
Apparently... I don't know the details...


{S3A363}
[Y¤u]
But I think it's all just an act.


{S3A364}
[Y¤u]
"I think she's just taking the money and 
researching something else."

[Kid]
Something else?


48 :

{S3A365}
[Y¤u]
I told you yesterday, didn't I?


49 :

{S3A366}
[Y¤u]
The ancient idea of 'the third eye'.

[Kid]
Your mom sounds sneaky.


{S3A367}
[Y¤u]
Well, she is.


{S3A368}
[Y¤u]
Still, I think I understand how she feels.


{S3A369}
[Y¤u]
"Even if they dug up all the ocean floors of 
the world, there's still no way they would 
find the ruins of the Lemurian continent."


{S3A370}
[Y¤u]
"Everybody knows that it's a complete waste 
of time."


{S3A371}
[Y¤u]
"Even the higher-ups at Leiblich 
Pharmaceuticals probably know."


{S3A372}
[Y¤u]
"But they still have to go about pretending to 
do research."

[Kid]
I wonder why? It sounds like a waste to me.


{S3A373}
[Y¤u]
"Who knows? But it's a company we're talking 
about, so I'll bet it has to do with money."


{S3A374}
[Y¤u]
"But there's no way for us to know, and I 
don't really care."


50 :
Tap, tap, tap...


51 :
[Kid]
"Oh, that's right. I've been meaning to ask 
you, but..."


52 :
[Kid]
It's kind of been bugging me...


53 :
[Kid]
"What do you mean that your mom is researching 
'the third eye'?"


{S3A375}
[Y¤u]
In a nutshell, it basically means that...


{S3A376}
[Y¤u]
"A dimension of value 'n' may only be understood 
in its entirety when viewed from a dimension at 
least 'n+1'."


54 :
[Kid]
Huh?

It didn't sound very basic to me.

What did she mean?


{S3A377}
[Y¤u]
"Essentially, only by gaining a sense of the 
fourth dimension can we really fully sense the 
whole of what's going on around us."

[Kid]
?

I had no idea what she was talking about.


{S3A378}
[Y¤u]
"Like when the third eye has opened up, or 
something."


55 :
Y¤u's hands stopped typing there for an
instant, and she popped her neck loudly.

She reached out for her cup and took a sip of
coffee.


56 :
[Kid]
What's a third eye?


57 :

{S3A379}
[Y¤u]
"The third eye I'm talking about is the 
mythological one that deals with supernatural 
powers."


{S3A380}
[Y¤u]
For example...


58 :

{S3A381}
[Y¤u]
"Like the third eye on the forehead of the 
Hindu god Shiva... Like they say in yoga about 
the Agya Chakra, or Third Eye Chakra..."


{S3A901}
[Y¤u]
Or the astral light training by sages...


{S3A902}
[Y¤u]
"...Or like in esoteric Buddhism with the 
famous monk Kobo Daishi's ascetic training 
and invoking of the Kokuzo deity of space 
through the Kokuzo gumonjiho..."


{S3A383}
[Y¤u]
"Like the All Knowing Eye in Tibetan Tantric 
Buddhism."

[Kid]
Uh... Uh...

I felt like I was being bombarded with exotic
words.

The conversation had completely left me behind.


{S2B229}
[Y¤u]
"Clairvoyance, telescopic vision, ghost sense, 
the gift of the prophet, the power of seeing 
the past or future..."


{S2B230}
[Y¤u]
"There are a lot of explanations behind it. 
Some say it's a gift from the gods, others 
that you can acquire it from intensive 
training. But what they all have in common is..."

When the third eye opens, true wisdom is
apparent, and all becomes visible.


59 :

{S2B231}
[Y¤u]
"They all have something to do with 
transcending the realm of the human... Becoming 
superhuman somehow."

[Kid]
"Hmmmm. Wow... I don't get it, but it sounds 
pretty fantastic."


60 :

{S3A384}
[Y¤u]
"Please don't say, 'I wish I had that!' Please, 
please don't."

[Kid]
Wh-why...

I had actually been thinking just that.


61 :

{S3A385}
[Y¤u]
Forget it. It's unattainable anyway.


{S3A386}
[Y¤u]
"No matter how much you want it, I don't want 
you buying tacky mail order space pendants 
that promise wisdom or anything else."

[Kid]
What are those?

More words I didn't know.


62 :

{S3A387}
[Y¤u]
If you don't know, you should stay that way.

[Kid]
...


63 :

{S3A388}
[Y¤u]
"So the third eye in terms of human anatomical 
science is simply a function that we have lost 
with evolution."


64 :
I wondered why we only had two eyes.

Common knowledge had it that, physically, two
eyes were enough for gauging the distance to
a point or focusing on something.

But what would it be like if we really used to
have three eyes?

{16:4}

65 :
Actually...

The animal ancestors of vertebrates had three
eyes.

Early species of primitive reptiles...

Like the tuatara lizard that still had a third
eye on the top of its head.

{16:4}

66 :
‡LThe third eye.

{1}

The organ had a similar function to the
eyeball and lay on the top of the head.

That organ would be sensitive to the light of
the outside world and control internal hormone
secretion and balance based on light.

An eye on the crest of one's head would stare
straight up. It seemed safe to say that it
would sense the difference in light between
day and night.

{16:4}



67 :
A right eye, a left eye, and one above...

An eye on the top of the head to stare at the
sky.


68 :
Only we people and higher vertebrates had lost
the third eye over a long process of
evolution. It had been covered over by the
cerebrum, and we lost our ability to sense
light directly.

Therefore, we had two light sensitive eyeballs,
one on each side, instead.

The lost third eye was called a 'pineal body'.

{16:4}

69 :
It had functioned in the brain for eons and
was responsible for secreting hormones that
helped carve out our 24-hour rhythm.

What we called our 'internal clocks' existed
because of the pineal body.

{16:4}

70 :
[Kid]
"You mean like an appendix or the webbing 
between fingers?"


{S2B247}
[Y¤u]
That's exactly what I mean.

[Kid]
"Still, you've got tons of knowledge... You're 
like a walking dictionary."


71 :

{S3A389}
[Y¤u]
It's no big deal.


{S3A390}
[Y¤u]
The information I have is completely useless.

[Kid]
Really.


{S3A391}
[Y¤u]
It's true.


72 :

{S3A392}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, no matter how much knowledge you 
have, it can't make you happy, right?"


{S3A393}
[Y¤u]
"It just makes you feel so 
ignorant... Scholarship is a pretty empty 
pursuit."

[Kid]
...


{S2B253}
[Y¤u]
Still, I can't very well just throw it away.


{S2B254}
[Y¤u]
"Maybe it's completely rooted itself into my 
brain."

[Kid]
But you planted it there yourself, right?


73 :

{S2B255}
[Y¤u]
No way!


{S2B256}
[Y¤u]
My mom's the guilty one.

[Kid]
Your mom?


74 :

{S2B259}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, when I was little, she told me all 
these third eye stories instead of 
lullabies."

[Kid]
Wow...


75 :

{S2B260}
[Y¤u]
I used to hate archaeology...

Y¤u sighed as she said that.


{S2B261}
[Y¤u]
"But one day, I just woke up and found myself 
in the archaeology department."

[Kid]
Like mother, like daughter?


76 :

{S2B262}
[Y¤u]
It's not that simple.

Y¤u gave another deep sigh.


{S2B263}
[Y¤u]
It's like some kind of curse.

[Kid]
...

[Kid]
"Uh, if we could get back to what we were 
talking about..."


77 :
[Kid]
"I think yesterday you said something about 
evolution."

[Kid]
"About losing that organ thingy on the 
head... The, um..."


78 :

{S3A394}
[Y¤u]
No, no. Not there.


79 :

{S3A395}
[Y¤u]
"It's here, it's called the third eye, and 
it has to do with supernatural powers."


{S3A396}
[Y¤u]
It's like...


{S3A381}
[Y¤u]
"Like the third eye on the forehead of the 
Hindu god Shiva... Like they say in yoga about 
the Agya Chakra, or Third Eye Chakra..."


{S3A901}
[Y¤u]
Or the astral light training by sages...


{S3A902}
[Y¤u]
"...Or like in esoteric Buddhism with the 
famous monk Kobo Daishi's ascetic training 
and invoking of the Kokuzo deity of space 
through the Kokuzo gumonjiho..."


{S3A383}
[Y¤u]
"Like the All Knowing Eye in Tibetan Tantric 
Buddhism."

[Kid]
Uh... Uh...

I felt like I was being bombarded with exotic
words.

The conversation had completely left me behind.


80 :

{S3A397}
[Y¤u]
I think I mentioned it yesterday, but...


{S3A398}
[Y¤u]
"When the third eye opens, true wisdom is 
apparent, and all becomes visible... At least 
that's what they say."

[Kid]
...


81 :

{S3A399}
[Y¤u]
That's IF the story is real.

[Kid]
Uh, so let's see... That means...


82 :
[Kid]
In summary, it goes something like this...

[Kid]
"Your mom is researching an ancient concept 
called the third eye or third perspective..."

[Kid]
"And once someone has acquired the third eye, 
they can sense the fourth dimension and see the 
whole of the world."

[Kid]
"And that is in line with the legend of the 
third eye."


83 :

{S3A400}
[Y¤u]
That should be about it.


{S3A401}
[Y¤u]
"Well, to hear my mom tell it, the third eye 
and third perspective are the same."

[Kid]
I don't quite get it...

[Kid]
"Why would a sense of the fourth dimension allow 
someone to understand the whole world?"

[Kid]
"Or why is a sense of the fourth dimension 
necessary? We're seeing the world the way we 
are right now."

[Kid]
"I don't get the connection between the third 
eye or third perspective... and the fourth 
dimension..."

There were lots of things I didn't get.

The whole concept seemed to be beyond my
understanding.


84 :

{S3A402}
[Y¤u]
Alright... Break's over.


85 :
Tap, tap, tap...

Y¤u started working again without answering my
question.

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u.


{S3A403}
[Y¤u]
"Sorry, let's make that the end of today's 
lecture."


{S3A404}
[Y¤u]
The explanation from here is pretty hard.


{S3A405}
[Y¤u]
And it's pretty obvious I'm busy, right?


{S3A406}
[Y¤u]
"If you really wanna know, next time I'll 
explain it in an easy to swallow way."

Y¤u didn't say anything more.

[Kid]
...Okay.

I decided to give up for the time being.

I remembered I was still holding the cup.

I figured not drinking it would be a waste, so
I drank it down.

Gulp.

(Yuck... This is so bitter.)

And it was completely cold too.


86 :

{S3A407}
[Y¤u]
Oh, I give up.

Y¤u muttered that and looked down dejectedly.

She leaned back in the chair, and it squeaked.

In the end, she hadn't found any new clues.


Actually, she hadn't even gotten past the
authorization screen.

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

That message had been displayed again and
again. It still sat in the middle of the
screen.


{S3A408}
[Y¤u]
Oh...

Y¤u was really down.

[Kid]
So you couldn't get it? The password.


{S3A409}
[Y¤u]
Nope.

[Kid]
Don't you have any ideas?


87 :

{S3A410}
[Y¤u]
Like what?

[Kid]
"I mean, when somebody sets a password, it's 
usually a word that has to do with them."

[Kid]
"A birthday or phone number for something 
short."

[Kid]
"Even somebody that wanted to think of 
something nobody would know would probably 
come up with a phrase related to their past."


88 :
[Kid]
"I mean, there's almost nobody that uses a 
meaningless combination of numbers and 
letters."

[Kid]
If they did, they would probably forget it.

[Kid]
"And if they forget it, then a password is 
meaningless..."


89 :

{S3A411}
[Y¤u]
"I know that. I tried all the things I could 
think of."


{S3A412}
[Y¤u]
"I tried them backwards, as an anagram, and 
all possible patterns I could imagine..."


90 :

{S3A413}
[Y¤u]
But it's no good.


{S3A414}
[Y¤u]
"I'm just a normal person when it comes to 
computers."


91 :

{S3A415}
[Y¤u]
"I'm no hacker or cracker. I don't have any 
illegal programs and can't just type one out 
right now."

Y¤u stuck her hands up in the air, signaling
her surrender.

[Kid]
I know! Sara could probably do it, right?

I remembered that Sara was a top-level hacker.

[Kid]
"You said that Sara took first prize in some 
code-breaking contest, right?"

[Kid]
"I'll bet she'd make a password-breaking 
program for you."


92 :

{S3A416}
[Y¤u]
Maybe.

Y¤u didn't seem keen on the idea.

[Kid]
Why don't you ask her?


{S3A417}
[Y¤u]
I could, but I don't want to.

[Kid]
?


93 :

{S3A418}
[Y¤u]
I don't want to involve her in this.

I thought that maybe she was still concerned
about the criminal element of the idea.

[Kid]
But you don't mind getting me involved?


94 :

{S3A419}
[Y¤u]
Well, you came and involved yourself.

[Kid]
I suppose...

But at that rate, Y¤u probably wouldn't find a
clue during her lifetime.

I wanted to help her out.

As a way of thanking her for helping me.


95 :

{S3A420}
[Y¤u]
There is just one clue...

Y¤u took a piece of paper from atop the
console.

[Kid]
What's that?


96 :

{S3A421}
[Y¤u]
This was inside my mom's machine.


97 :

{S3A422}
I sneaked into her research room before
coming here.



{S3A423}
I was looking for clues about my father,
of course.



{S3A424}
When I went in, I saw that her computer was on.



{S3A425}
Looking at it, I saw that there was a text file
entitled 'Password'.



{S3A426}
When I opened it, it was only one line...



{S3A427}
There was some Japanese sentence typed
inside it.


{16:4}

98 :
[Kid]
Then you saw the password!


{S3A428}
[Y¤u]
Sure. I saw it.


99 :

{S3A429}
[Y¤u]
But I don't remember it.

[Kid]
What?


100 :

{S3A430}
[Y¤u]
I was in a hurry.


101 :

{S3A431}
I tried to take a note of it before I was
found out.


{S3A432}
But I didn't see a pen or anything around.



{S3A433}
And there were no discs or anything that I
could copy it to.


{16:4}

102 :

{S3A434}
[Y¤u]
"Thinking about it now, I should have sent it 
to myself by e-mail..."


103 :

{S3A435}
But I was in a rush and didn't think about it
then.



{S3A436}
Suddenly, I thought that I'd try to print it
out...



{S3A437}
As soon it stopped printing, my mom came back.



{S3A438}
I snatched the paper that was in the tray and
jammed it in my pocket.


{16:4}

104 :
[Kid]
Huh? What do you mean?

[Kid]
"So the paper you have now is the one with the 
password on it?"

Y¤u held out the paper without saying anything.

[Kid]
Huh? What's this?


105 :
[Kid]
A barcode?


{S3A439}
[Y¤u]
"It looks like it, but it seems different than 
normal barcodes."

[Kid]
It's got ten lines?


{S3A440}
[Y¤u]
Yup.

[Kid]
What does this have to do with anything?


{S3A441}
[Y¤u]
Who knows?

[Kid]
"About how many characters were in that 
password?"

[Kid]
You said it was in Japanese, right?

[Kid]
About how many characters was it?


{S3A442}
[Y¤u]
"I don't remember very well. Maybe ten 
characters, give or take."

[Kid]
Was it all written in Japanese? Any numbers?


{S3A443}
[Y¤u]
"I'm pretty sure it was just Japanese. I don't 
remember any numbers or anything else."

[Kid]
I wonder which end of this is the top.


{S3A444}
[Y¤u]
You got me.

[Kid]
Or could it be written vertically? No way.

[Kid]
"If you printed out a text file, why would it 
come out as a barcode?"


{S3A445}
[Y¤u]
Who knows?


106 :
[Kid]
No hints?


{S3A446}
[Y¤u]
Hints?


107 :

{S3A447}
[Y¤u]
"If I don't know the answer, how can I give 
you a hint?"

[Kid]
But you have to remember something, right?

[Kid]
"Like, did it have to do with food, or a 
person's name..."

Y¤u shook her head and spoke.


108 :

{S3A448}
[Y¤u]
I saw it, but only for a second.

[Kid]
"But how could you forget something so 
important?"


109 :

{S3A449}
[Y¤u]
Well, at least I know my address.


{S3A450}
[Y¤u]
"And phone number. And birthday. And my social 
security number. And..."


{S3A451}
[Y¤u]
I even know my name.

[Kid]
.........


110 :

{S3A452}
[Y¤u]
Now who's forgetting the important things?


111 :
I looked again at the paper we thought
contained the password.

I was obsessed with solving the puzzle we had
found.

It was frustrating.

'Now who's forgetting the important things?'

...What could I say to that?

(It's not like I wanted to lose my memory!)


(Watch this! I'll remember everything just to
show you!)

But first... I had to figure it out.


I had my mind set on it.

I almost felt like solving it was a rite of passage
that would help restore my memory.

.........

.........

.........

112 :
What was I supposed to do...?

113 :
{11:0-65}
{11:1}I get it

{11:1}I don't get it


114 :
(Could it be...?)

I thought for a second.

115 :
{11:0-67}
{11:2-d0}What if I turn it over...

{11:2-d1}What if I turn it upside down...

{11:2-d2}What if I heat it with a flame...

{11:2-d3}What if I rip it in two...

{11:2-d4}What if I tilt it...

{11:2-d5}What if I wad it up...


116 :
I thought that if I turned it over, I might be
able to read something.

I turned the paper over and held it up to the
light.


117 :
[Kid]
.........

It was no good. Turning it over showed nothing
new.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?

[Kid]
"Yup. I figured out that I can't read it this 
way."


{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


118 :
I thought maybe I could read something if I
turned the paper upside down.

I turned it upside down.


119 :
[Kid]
.........

It was no good. Turning the paper upside down
showed nothing new.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?

[Kid]
"Yup. I figured out that I can't read it this 
way."


{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


120 :
I thought maybe if I heated it with a flame, I
could read it.

[Kid]
Hey, you don't have a lighter, do you?


{S3A456}
[Y¤u]
Huh? A lighter?


{S3A457}
[Y¤u]
"Don't tell me you want to calm your nerves 
with a smoke."


{S3A458}
[Y¤u]
You're too young to smoke!

[Kid]
I know that...

[Kid]
I wanted to use it on the paper...


{S3A459}
[Y¤u]
"You want to burn it? Playing with fire is 
dangerous!"


{S3A460}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, this paper is the only clue I've 
got. I won't let you burn it."

[Kid]
That's not what I mean.


{S3A461}
[Y¤u]
Well, what then?

[Kid]
"I thought that if I heated the paper with a 
flame, something might appear..."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........


{S3A462}
[Y¤u]
You're kidding... Right?

[Kid]
Yeah. Haha. I'm just joking...

I figured out that I couldn't read it
that way.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


121 :
I thought that if I folded it in half, maybe I
could read something.

I took it and folded it in half.


122 :
[Kid]
.........

It was no good. Folding showed nothing new.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?

[Kid]
"Yup. I figured out that I can't read it this 
way."


{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


123 :
I thought that if I tilted it a little, I might
be able to see something.

124 :
{11:0-6d}
{11:1}Tilt it a little to the side

{11:1}Tilt it almost completely to the side

{11:1}Tilt it a little vertically

{11:1}Tilt it almost completely vertically


125 :
[Kid]
.........

It didn't help. Changing the angle showed
nothing new.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?

[Kid]
"Yup. I figured out that I can't read it this 
way."


{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


126 :
I rolled the paper in a ball,
but I still couldn't read anything.

I rolled the paper into a stick-like shape.


127 :
[Kid]
.........

It was no good. Rolling it up showed nothing
new.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?

[Kid]
"Yup. I figured out that I can't read it this 
way."


{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

(Hmmmm. Let's see.)


128 :
[Kid]
...............

No. I've got no idea.


{S3A453}
[Y¤u]
So? Did you figure it out?


129 :
[Kid]
No... Not yet.


130 :

{S3A454}
[Y¤u]
I told you it's impossible.


{S3A455}
[Y¤u]
I tried all kinds of things.

[Kid]
"But if we just change our way of looking at 
things, I think we'll figure it out."

(Huh?)

(By changing the way we look... we'll figure it
out?)

Something about my words triggered something
in my mind.


131 :

{S3A463}
[Y¤u]
Why don't we just give up?

[Kid]
I won't give up.


{S3A464}
[Y¤u]
You're pretty stubborn for a punk Kid!

[Kid]
Be quiet.


{S3A465}
[Y¤u]
"And somebody that can't even understand the 
difference between two dimensions and three 
dimensions."

[Kid]
Huh?


{S3A466}
[Y¤u]
"See? The characters on the paper are 
two-dimensional, and we're three-dimensional."


{S3A467}
[Y¤u]
"Basically, the worlds that we live in are 
different."


{S3A468}
[Y¤u]
"So if you really want to understand what this 
barcode has to say, then you have to think 
two-dimensionally."

[Kid]
.........


{S3A469}
[Y¤u]
So? Whaddya think?

(The stuff on the paper is two-dimensional...
and we are three-dimensional.)

I had to think two-dimensionally.

(What do I have to do to think
two-dimensionally...?)


132 :
[Kid]
"I got it! Listen, if you take the paper and 
set it like this..."

[Kid]
What? Let's see...

[Kid]
"'The empty fall sky...{1}
A single cuckoo calls out...{1}
Brings a chill to me'."

[Kid]
What is this?


{S3A470}
[Y¤u]
What!? Let me see that!


133 :
Y¤u grabbed the slip of paper from my hand.

Then she copied me and set the paper sideways
in the same way.


134 :

{S3A471}
[Y¤u]
Y-you're right!


{S3A472}
[Y¤u]
Amazing...! Really amazing, Kid!

Y¤u grabbed my hand and shook it happily.

...But she didn't stop there. She pulled me
close in a big bear hug.

Squeeze...!

My face was pressed hard against her bust.

It was a nice fit... A little too nice... I struggled for
air.

[Kid]
I... give up... Have... mercy...

I almost felt dangerously excited by her softness.



{S3A473}
[Y¤u]
We did it! Yeah, yeah, yeah~

Finally, Y¤u let me go.

She jumped around gleefully like a rabbit.

(I was glad she was happy... even if she did
almost crush me.)

Watching Y¤u all happy like that seemed to
wash away all my irritation and fatigue.

The stress I was feeling simply faded away.

It was like the winter frost melting away
under the spring sun.


135 :

{S3A474}
[Y¤u]
"I get it now. You can't see it from right 
above it."


{S3A475}
[Y¤u]
But if you look from the side... I see it now.

[Kid]
"But why do you suppose it came out in a 
barcode like this?"


{S3A476}
[Y¤u]
The printer is probably in bad shape.

[Kid]
"Think so? It's hard to believe that would 
make it print like this."


{S3A477}
[Y¤u]
I don't care about that now.


{S3A478}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, as long as I have the password, 
things are fine."

'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.

{S3A479}
[Y¤u]
"I think it's a variation of Masaoka Shiki's{1}
'The empty June sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'."


{S3A480}
[Y¤u]
So if I input it like this...


{S3A481}
[Y¤u]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.
"


[Kid]
Wow.


136 :

{S3A482}
[Y¤u]
Alright! Let's try this for a password.


137 :
A recharged Y¤u faced the screen triumphantly.

But...


138 :
Tap, tap, tap...


{S3A483}
[Y¤u]
"'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.{1}
Okay then!"


139 :
Tap!


140 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

But she still couldn't get into the C Level
information.


141 :
[Kid]
It's no good. Time to give up!


142 :

{S3A484}
[Y¤u]
See, I told you so.

[Kid]
...


{S3A485}
[Y¤u]
"I told you it was impossible to figure out 
from the start."

[Kid]
.........


143 :

{S3A486}
[Y¤u]
Should I try one last time?

[Kid]
"There's still a potential password you 
haven't tried?"


{S3A487}
[Y¤u]
"Yup. But I thought it wouldn't work, so I 
tried everything else I could think of."


144 :
Y¤u stared into the computer monitor.


145 :
Tap, tap, tap...

...


146 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

Things just didn't seem to want to go our way.


{S3A488}
[Y¤u]
Arrrggghhh! Damn!


{S3A489}
[Y¤u]
Now that things have come to this...


{S3A490}
[Y¤u]
Abracadabra...

[Kid]
Huh?


147 :
Tap, tap, tap...


{S3A491}
[Y¤u]
Open sesame!


148 :
Beeeeeeeep!


149 :
Tap, tap, tap...


{S3A492}
[Y¤u]
Magic carpet...!


150 :
Beeeeeeeep!


151 :
Tap, tap, tap...


{S3A493}
[Y¤u]
"On Dasher and Dancer, and Prancer and 
Vixen... Come on!"


152 :
Beeeeeeeep!

Of course, none of those phrases got her
access to the C Level information.

I didn't see why she had to shout all of them
out either.

I was already at my wit's end and incapable of
speech.


153 :
And then, suddenly‡L


154 :

{S3A494}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what in the...?

The screen went black.

[Kid]
Wh-what just happened?


155 :

{S3A495}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know, but it looks like it 
automatically shut down the authorization 
screen..."

[Kid]
Huh?

After a moment, the screen returned to normal.


156 :
Y¤u pecked away at the keyboard and called up
the authorization screen again.


157 :
Tap, tap, tap...


158 :
Tap!


159 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Cannot log in with the given
name at this time.'


{S3A496}
[Y¤u]
What!? What is this!?


160 :
She tried it again.


161 :
Beeeeeeeep!

The result was the same.

[Kid]
What does this mean?


162 :

{S3A497}
[Y¤u]
"Maybe I entered the wrong password too many 
times and it activated some kind of 
protection."


163 :

{S3A498}
[Y¤u]
"In other words, LeMMIH has completely denied 
access to my mom's name."

[Kid]
So...


164 :

{S3A499}
[Y¤u]
"So we'll have to give up for the time being, 
I guess."

Y¤u shrugged exaggeratedly.


165 :
