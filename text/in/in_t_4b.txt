1 :
It was really hard to wake up after falling back
asleep.

And when I couldn't get up, I'd get irritated.

The reason I couldn't sleep was beyond me.


I probably couldn't sleep because I was so caught
up in not being able to sleep.

A vicious cycle.

(Man, this is really bad...)

I was still groggy, but thankfully, I wasn't so
sleepy that it was driving me crazy.

I opened and closed my hand.

My body seemed to be in pretty good shape...

I shook my head.

I slapped my cheeks.

Then I breathed in a deep rush of cold air,
breathed it out, and gradually cleared my head.

Mustering up my strength, I jumped out of bed.

I re-inserted the voice converter into my ear.

[Takeshi]
"Bout time I started cooking breakfast for 
you all!"

But when I looked around...

[Takeshi]
...No one's here!?

The conference room was empty.

[Takeshi]
Hold up, what time is it?

I checked my PDA display anxiously.

It was just shy of 9 a.m....


2 :

{T4B000}
[Y¤u]
You are so laaaaaaate!

Y¤u was standing guard in front of the kiosk.

The Kid, £o¢o, and Pipi were sitting and
waiting.


{T4B001}
[Y¤u]
Late, late, late, late!


3 :

{T4B002}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, you're a total mess.

Y¤u's cheeks looked a little swollen.

[Takeshi]
Aw, sorry, my bad...


4 :

{T4B003}
[Y¤u]
We've been waiting forever!


{T4B004}
[Y¤u]
I'm starving...


5 :

{T4B005}
[Y¤u]
"Look, if my belly actually sticks to my 
spine, I'm holding you personally 
responsible..."


6 :

{T4B006}
[Y¤u]
Dear Lord!


7 :

{T4B007}
[Y¤u]
"Remember me when I waste away to almost 
nothing and am blown by the wind across the 
Pacific!"

[Takeshi]
"You're worried about being blown away by the 
WIND?"

[Takeshi]
"I think it'd probably take a hurricane to 
carry you off."


8 :

{T4B008}
[Y¤u]
...You're a real gentleman, Kuranari.

Y¤u's shoulders sagged for some reason.

[Takeshi]
I can't believe you guys haven't eaten yet.

I looked around at them.


9 :

{T4B009}
[Y¤u]
Well, you see...


{T4B010}
[£o¢o]
We did try...


{T4B011}
[Kid]
I'd say we tried a little too hard...


{PIPI_03}
[Pipi]
*Woof*?

They looked at one another with a mix of
conflicting expressions.


10 :
[Takeshi]
?

I cocked my head quizzically at them and went
around into the kiosk's kitchen.

[Takeshi]
What's going on here?

There was an impossibly delicious smell...


And a blackened, charred piece of fried tuna.

Red, black, green‡Leverything was splattered
with a mysterious fluid.

The sandwich buns were colorful and sticky.


The lettuce that normally went into the
tuna sandwiches had been diced.

I'd never seen such a shocking kitchen.


[Takeshi]
Wh-what exactly happened here?


11 :

{T4B012}
[£o¢o]
Neeheehee~


12 :

{T4B013}
[£o¢o]
We tried dividing up the work~


{T4B014}
[£o¢o]
Let's eat, Takepyon, let's eat~

[Takeshi]
H-hey! Wait, wait!

[Takeshi]
Is this food? You can actually eat this?


{T4B015}
[£o¢o]
Yup.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid, you serious?


13 :

{T4B016}
[Kid]
Well, sort of...

[Takeshi]
Sort of?


{T4B017}
[Kid]
"I don't exactly know if it'll taste GOOD, 
but..."


14 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
Why did you stop talking?


15 :

{T4B018}
[£o¢o]
Neeheehee~


16 :

{T4B019}
[£o¢o]
Now, now, let's not be critical~

[Takeshi]
.........

Apparently, there had been a number of reasons
why I was in charge of cooking.


17 :

{T4B020}
[Y¤u]
Alrighty then.


{T4B021}
[Y¤u]
Time for a post-meal break?

They all trooped over to the rest area.

I had safely finished eating... but my stomach
was still growling.

Would I be okay?

Doing the dishes was an unpleasant job, but
with everyone's cooperation, we got the ordeal
over and done with.


18 :

{T4B022}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey, Takepyon.


{T4B023}
[£o¢o]
I took Tsugumin's sandwich over to her.

[Takeshi]
Oh, thanks.

I patted £o¢o's head.

Before I tackled the cleanup, I had picked
out some decent sandwiches and had £o¢o take
them over.

Whether the still-recovering Tsugumi would
actually eat them was another story...

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o, was Tsugumi eating alright?


19 :

{T4B024}
[£o¢o]
"Yeah, she said she was really hungry. I 
think she ate three."

[Takeshi]
"Hm... Well, I guess she's gotten well enough 
to eat then."


{T4B025}
[£o¢o]
"She's getting better pretty fast, don't you 
think?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah...


20 :
That Tsugumi...

The night before, she'd said she wanted to
die.


21 :
The fact that she was eating meant that at
least her body was determined to live.

If she would just continue that tendency and
get well, I thought there'd be no more
problems...


22 :
...Wait, that was a contradiction.


23 :
'All the things that keep us alive, the
things that drive us, are filthy.'

'There is no such thing as a life of purity.'

She said something along those lines.


But then...

Despite that, she demolished three whole
sandwiches without even thinking about it...?

Well, then again, I was the one who told £o¢o
to take the sandwiches down because it would
be bad if she didn't eat something...

So I was contradicting my earlier stance too,
but...

Something strange was going on!

What was the deal?

The word 'hypocrite' came to mind...

Then what on earth was she supposed to be!?

Tsugumi... What was she thinking...!?

I couldn't help but feel resentment rising in
my chest.


24 :

{T4B026}
[£o¢o]
What's the matter, Takepyon?


{T4B027}
[£o¢o]
Your face got all scary for a moment...

[Takeshi]
Ah, it's nothing.


25 :
I didn't want to show my sullen mood.

I didn't even want to be thinking about her
anymore.


26 :
Waving with one hand, I tried my best to
sweep my mood away.


27 :

{T4B028}
[£o¢o]
Oh, good~


{T4B029}
[£o¢o]
"I thought maybe those sandwiches had given 
you a tummy ache~"

[Takeshi]
"Why!? Did you put something in there that 
would make me sick?"


28 :

{T4B030}
[£o¢o]
Well, Takepyon, do you really want to know?


{T4B031}
[£o¢o]
You won't be sorry, right?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"No, stop! Don't tell me, I don't want to 
know."

Just imagining the possibilities was making my
stomach hurt...


29 :
Tsugumi was probably always just pretending
to be tough.

Distancing people by saying awful things was
one of her bad habits.

The fact that she was eating meant that at
least her body was determined to live.

As long as she recovered completely, there
would be no more problems.

(Hey, it's a good thing.)

I felt my chest relax in relief.


30 :

{T4B032}
[£o¢o]
"You just got a happy look on your face, 
Takepyon."

[Takeshi]
Oh, really?


{T4B033}
[£o¢o]
"You were really worrying about Tsugumin, 
huh...?"

Feeling so transparent made me want to
conceal the truth.

[Takeshi]
No, no, it's not that.

[Takeshi]
"I was just thinking that those sandwiches 
were pretty good after all."


31 :

{T4B034}
[£o¢o]
Wow, really!?


32 :

{T4B035}
[£o¢o]
Oh, good~


{T4B036}
[£o¢o]
"Actually, I made your sandwich all by my 
very own self~"


33 :

{T4B037}
[£o¢o]
Heehee, you see...


34 :

{T4B038}
[£o¢o]
I used lots of my secret sauce~


{T4B039}
[£o¢o]
Mayo, mustard, horseradish...


35 :

{T4B040}
[£o¢o]
"And then some salt and pepper, and a dab of 
soy sauce, and lots of butter..."


{T4B041}
[£o¢o]
"Then, when it was done, cinnamon and cardamon 
and turmeric and nutmeg and vanilla, all 
shaken together and poured!"


36 :

{T4B042}
[£o¢o]
And then, then... What was it again?


37 :

{T4B043}
[£o¢o]
"Allspice, and curry, and hot sauce... and some 
tube of something Pipi found, we used lots of 
that..."


38 :

{T4B044}
[£o¢o]
And then we stuck the lettuce in between!


39 :

{T4B045}
[£o¢o]
Magnificent, right? And pretty too.


40 :

{T4B046}
[£o¢o]
I didn't actually taste it, so I was a bit nervous...


41 :

{T4B047}
[£o¢o]
But you said it was delicious, right?


{T4B048}
[£o¢o]
Well, maybe I should make the next meal then?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Nah, you don't have to do that. I'll keep 
doing the cooking..."

Just listening to her was making my gut ache...


42 :
Gathering my wits, I went to the bench where
Y¤u and the Kid were sitting.

£o¢o and Pipi trotted along behind me.


43 :

{T4B049}
[Kid]
Hey Y¤u, where did Sora go?


{T4B050}
[Y¤u]
"She went to go look again to see if she can 
find some clue to help us escape."


{T4B051}
[Y¤u]
"From what she said, the sensors on the third 
floor are working a little bit better..."


{T4B052}
[Kid]
Hmmm...

[Takeshi]
Did you see Sora, Y¤u?

I cut in front of them.


44 :

{T4B053}
[Y¤u]
"Huh? Oh yeah, for a minute, before you came 
to the kiosk."

[Takeshi]
"I see... Did Sora say anything else? Did she 
seem different somehow?"


{T4B054}
[Y¤u]
No, not really. Same as always.

[Takeshi]
Okay.

[Takeshi]
Well, that's good.


45 :

{T4B055}
[Y¤u]
Hm...? Kuranari, did you do something to her?

[Takeshi]
N-no! Nothing!


{T4B056}
[Y¤u]
"You're acting pretty suspicious. Why'd you 
say, 'Well, that's good'...?"


{T4B057}
[Y¤u]
"Not that I'm the type to hound you with 
questions or anything."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


46 :

{T4B058}
[Y¤u]
So what's the story, my dear Kuranari-san?

She laughed and pretended to hold a microphone to
my face.


{T4B059}
[Y¤u]
Can you tell me how you're feeling right now?

[Takeshi]
"I don't care what happens, I'm not talking to 
you."


47 :

{T4B060}
[Y¤u]
This is reporter Tanaka Y¤u, reporting live.

She withdrew her invisible microphone.


48 :

{T4B061}
[Kid]
Hey, that reminds me...

The Kid muttered, glancing at me.


49 :

{T4B062}
[Kid]
"Apparently, Takeshi sneaked out of his room 
in the middle of the night."


50 :

{T4B063}
[Y¤u]
Oho! Relevant circumstantial evidence!

Next, the invisible microphone was pointed at
the Kid.


51 :

{T4B064}
[Kid]
I thought maybe you were sleepwalking.


{T4B065}
[Kid]
But you ran up the emergency stairs, so...


52 :

{T4B066}
[Kid]
"I went to sleep right after that, but it's 
been bothering me."


53 :

{T4B067}
[Y¤u]
What do you have to say for yourself, Kuranari?


54 :

{T4B068}
[Kid]
"If you don't want to talk about it, don't 
worry..."


{T4B069}
[£o¢o]
"Huh? Wha-what? Are you talking about 
something fun?"


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof*!


55 :
All of their eyes were fixed on me.

Bathed in their attention, there was no way
for me to escape the microphone.

[Takeshi]
...*Sigh*...

[Takeshi]
Alright, ALRIGHT, I'll confess.

56 :
{11:0-be}
{11:1}I went to see Tsugumi

{11:1}I was just meeting Sora

{11:1}I just went to the bathroom


57 :
[Takeshi]
I went to see Tsugumi.

I told the truth.


58 :

{T4B070}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi?

[Takeshi]
"I was going to take a walk when Sora came up 
and told me that Tsugumi had woken up."

[Takeshi]
"I didn't want her to start wandering around 
and hurt herself, so I rushed right over to 
the infirmary..."


59 :

{T4B071}
[Y¤u]
Oh... Is that it?


{T4B072}
[Y¤u]
"Actually, I guess I did hear pretty much 
the same thing from Sora, how Tsugumi woke up."

[Takeshi]
What, so you knew all along?


{T4B073}
[Y¤u]
"Sorry, just thought I'd give you a hard 
time..."

[Takeshi]
Man...


{T4B074}
[Kid]
But you should have called us.

[Takeshi]
Hm? You're right, I wasn't thinking.

[Takeshi]
"Well, I don't know about you, Kid, but Y¤u 
was dead to the world. I didn't figure it'd 
be any good to try to wake you guys up."


60 :

{T4B075}
[Y¤u]
Hey.


61 :
[Takeshi]
I was just meeting Sora.

I tried to be as honest as possible.


62 :

{T4B076}
[Y¤u]
Oho.

[Takeshi]
"Well, I went for a walk and ran into her. I 
was awake, so we jogged to Zweiter Stock 
together."


{T4B077}
[Kid]
"It didn't sound like jogging. More like you 
were RUNNING."


{T4B078}
[Kid]
The sound really echoed.

[Takeshi]
"Well, you know Sora, she can run so fast, I 
had to hurry just to keep up."


{T4B079}
[Y¤u]
Forget fast... Sora can run?


63 :
[Kid]
.........


64 :
[Takeshi]
I just went to the bathroom.


65 :

{T4B080}
[Kid]
Why did you wait and then run off?

[Takeshi]
At a certain point... it got pretty urgent.


{T4B081}
[Kid]
You were gone an awful long time.

[Takeshi]
Look, sometimes it takes me a long time...


{T4B082}
[Kid]
But why'd you go all the way upstairs?

[Takeshi]
Well, I like the upstairs toilet better.


66 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
"The one in the back. The color, the shape, 
the way it feels when you sit down..."

[Kid]
.........


67 :
[Takeshi]
Let's not get into the details, Kid.


68 :

{T4B083}
[Kid]
Ouch.

I cuffed him on the head.


{T4B084}
[Kid]
Alright, alright.


69 :

{T4B085}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, that's an invasion of privacy!

[Takeshi]
"Listen, Y¤u, you're the one who started this 
with your whole reporter act."


70 :

{T4B086}
[Y¤u]
Who, me?

She stuck out her tongue.


71 :
No one seemed inclined to question me
further, so that solved that. Everyone milled
around the rest area.

I felt the energy drain out of me. I wasn't
tense, but I wasn't relaxed either.

Maybe I was just tired.

I sat quietly, thinking...

When I couldn't sleep, I had been pondering
all sorts of things.

About Tsugumi...

And Sora...


72 :
Sora made me think about all kinds of
questions.

What was love?

What were people?

What was the meaning of life?

What was she herself...?

She was more worried about things than I was.


I didn't know the answers. The stress of so
many unknowns was starting to get to me.


73 :
I might have hurt Sora's feelings.


She always smiled and said she didn't mind,
but...

What would I say when I saw her?


74 :

{T4B087}
[Y¤u]
Which is why...

Hearing Y¤u's voice, I returned to earth with
a jolt.


75 :

{T4B088}
[Y¤u]
"So many Greek myths have been handed down to 
us."

Y¤u was standing in the middle of the room,
apparently giving a lecture.


76 :
The Kid, £o¢o, and Pipi were sitting on
benches, listening obediently.

I ended up listening myself.


77 :

{T4B089}
[Y¤u]
"You see that statue over there? It's a 
rather lovely piece..."

She turned around and pointed at the statue
in a corner of the rest area.


78 :

{T4B090}
[Y¤u]
"The beautiful statue and the sculptor who 
loved her... I'll tell you their story."


79 :

{T4B091}
[Y¤u]
Ahem.

She gave a melodramatic cough.


80 :
Then she turned back to the group and began
gesturing and talking.


81 :

{T4B092}
[Y¤u]
"Once upon a time, in a place called Cyprus, 
there was a young sculptor."


{T4B093}
[Y¤u]
"His name was Pygmalion. He's been called the 
'King of Cyprus'..."


82 :

{T4B094}
[Y¤u]
"But in these myths they tend to call anyone 
a 'king' or a 'god', so we won't go there for a 
bit..."


83 :

{T4B095}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, there was an excellent sculptor named 
Pygmalion. And then... Um..."


84 :

{T4B096}
[Y¤u]
"His statues were incredible. They were so 
vital, so full of life, they looked as though 
they might start moving at any moment."


{T4B097}
[Y¤u]
"But Pygmalion couldn't seem to get 
interested in ladies."


85 :

{T4B098}
[Y¤u]
"The people around him wondered why a 
brilliant sculptor like him couldn't land a 
wife."


86 :

{T4B099}
[Y¤u]
"But Pygmalion seemed to only care about 
making his statues."


{T4B100}
[Y¤u]
"Then, one day, he finished the nude figure of 
a woman."


87 :

{T4B101}
[Y¤u]
"It was a wonderful piece, absolutely 
charming, and even he himself thought it 
might be his ultimate masterpiece."


{T4B102}
[Y¤u]
But...


88 :

{T4B103}
[Y¤u]
"As he looked on her beautiful, almost living 
face..."


89 :

{T4B104}
[Y¤u]
"He realized that she was naked and became 
embarrassed..."


90 :

{T4B105}
[Y¤u]
He brought clothes for her and dressed her.


{T4B106}
[Y¤u]
"And when it got dark, he was so besotted 
with her that..."


91 :

{T4B107}
[Y¤u]
"He brought her food to eat, talked to her, 
and even slept next to her..."


{T4B108}
[Y¤u]
"It was the first time he had ever 
experienced true love."


{T4B109}
[Y¤u]
Love for the statue he himself had created...


{T4B110}
[Y¤u]
"He poured all the love that he had into her. 
He believed that, one day, she would speak to 
him..."


92 :

{T4B111}
[Y¤u]
"But in the meantime, he neglected his work, 
he forgot to eat and sleep... and Pygmalion 
began to waste away."


{T4B112}
[Y¤u]
"People began to worry that he would die...
so they prayed to the gods."


93 :

{T4B113}
[Y¤u]
And Pygmalion was agonizing as well...


94 :

{T4B114}
[Y¤u]
"He was so sad to see her unable to speak, 
eat, or sleep..."


95 :

{T4B115}
[Y¤u]
"He thought that when he himself became old 
and went to heaven..."


{T4B116}
[Y¤u]
"She would have to continue standing there, 
just waiting to decay..."


96 :

{T4B117}
[Y¤u]
To him, it was unthinkable...


97 :

{T4B118}
[Y¤u]
"If he couldn't be bound to her, it would be 
better to throw himself off a cliff."


98 :

{T4B119}
[Y¤u]
"If only she was a real woman, with blood 
running through her veins..."


99 :

{T4B120}
[Y¤u]
It went on just like that...


100 :

{T4B121}
[Y¤u]
"Until his prayers reached Aphrodite, the 
goddess of love."


{T4B122}
[Y¤u]
"Aphrodite came down to him and told him to 
kiss his beloved statue."


101 :

{T4B123}
[Y¤u]
When he gently kissed her...


102 :

{T4B124}
[Y¤u]
"Her skin flushed pink, her eyes opened, and 
she turned into a living woman."


103 :

{T4B125}
[Y¤u]
"A woman as beautiful as the statue had 
been..."


104 :

{T4B126}
[Y¤u]
So they married and even had children.


105 :

{T4B127}
[Y¤u]
"He kept making even more beautiful 
sculptures for temples around the world, and 
they lived..."


106 :

{T4B128}
[Y¤u]
Happily ever after.


107 :
Finally finished with her long story, Y¤u
pinched her skirt and curtsied.


108 :
£o¢o and the Kid applauded her.


{T4B129}
[Kid]
Hey, that was pretty interesting.


{T4B130}
[£o¢o]
Bravo, bravo, bravissima~

As for me...

109 :
{11:0-c1}
{11:1}Right, happily ever after...

{11:1}Watch silently

{11:1}Voice disagreement


110 :
[Takeshi]
Right, happily ever after...

I applauded with them.

[Takeshi]
Never knew you knew so much, Y¤u.


111 :

{T4B131}
[Y¤u]
Well.

She drew up proudly.


{T4B132}
[Y¤u]
I know a little about myth and folklore.

She raised a finger in front of her face,
looking demure.


112 :
[Takeshi]
.........

Hunh.

I thought it was a pretty scholarly talk...

But I kept quiet and watched the faces of
everyone.

With her finger still extended in front of
her face, Y¤u spoke confidently.


113 :
I raised my hand and declared...

[Takeshi]
I object!


114 :

{T4B133}
[Y¤u]
Yes?

[Takeshi]
What's happily ever after about that story?

[Takeshi]
It doesn't make any sense to me...


115 :

{T4B134}
[Y¤u]
Why not?

[Takeshi]
"Pygmalion just had an obsession with his 
sculpture..."

[Takeshi]
"He didn't work, he stayed inside talking to 
her..."

[Takeshi]
"Thinking, 'Oh, if only my statue was a real, 
beautiful woman'..."

[Takeshi]
What a dark, depressing story... Pygmalion...

[Takeshi]
I don't see anything happy about that.

[Takeshi]
"He just happened to have his selfish request 
granted by a goddess. The end."


116 :

{T4B135}
[Y¤u]
Listen, you don't get it at all...

Y¤u shook her finger at me.


{T4B136}
[Y¤u]
That's not the point of the story, Kuranari.

She threw back her shoulders and started
talking again.


117 :

{T4B137}
[Y¤u]
The story of Pygmalion...


{T4B138}
[Y¤u]
"Shows that if you hope and ask and 
persevere, your wish will come true."


118 :

{T4B139}
[Y¤u]
"His longing was answered because he put his 
heart into his sculpture and then loved her, 
believing that she would speak to him one 
day..."


{T4B140}
[Kid]
So that's it...


{T4B141}
[£o¢o]
Wow...


119 :

{T4B142}
[Y¤u]
"Okay, this is a little different, but this 
guy named Rosenthal wrote about something 
called the 'Pygmalion effect'..."

She was acting like a professor on a soapbox.


It seemed like she was overdoing the whole
thing.

But her ridiculous expressions were so
amusing that I got drawn in.


{T4B143}
[Y¤u]
"It's not quite the same as the placebo 
effect."


{T4B144}
[Y¤u]
"But both of them involve believing in 
something."


{T4B145}
[Y¤u]
"So they both have to do with our chances of 
survival."


{T4B146}
[Y¤u]
"Just because the sushi in the display case 
is made of plastic doesn't mean the sushi 
inside is cheap!"


{T4B147}
[Kid]
Whoa!?


{T4B148}
[£o¢o]
Wow...


120 :
Her talk seemed to have been derailed like a
nasty train wreck. I had no idea what she
meant.

But the Kid and £o¢o were a rapt audience.


121 :
Several minutes later...

Some time during Y¤u's long speech, my brain
started working again.


122 :
We all headed up the emergency stairs to the
second floor.


{T4B149}
[£o¢o]
Shall we all go and see Tsugumin?


{T4B150}
[Kid]
Yeah, I'd like to know how she's doing.


{T4B151}
[Y¤u]
Me too. Let's all go check up on her.

£o¢o's proposal came out of the blue, but
everyone agreed and headed upstairs.


123 :
[Takeshi]
Wonder how she's doing?


124 :

{T4B152}
[Y¤u]
In any case, she needs rest.

[Takeshi]
"Well, worrying about her won't make her 
better any faster."


{T4B153}
[Kid]
"Sora would let us know if anything had 
happened to her, right?"


125 :

{T4B154}
[Y¤u]
"Well, LeMMIH is always watching over the 
infirmary's medical computer data..."


{T4B155}
[Y¤u]
"Since LeMMIH hasn't alerted us to anything, 
it means that Tsugumi is probably 
sleeping peacefully."


{T4B156}
[Kid]
Well, that's a relief.


126 :

{T4B157}
[£o¢o]
Right, nothing to worry abouteroon~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof*!

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
Say, £o¢o?


127 :

{T4B158}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, what?

[Takeshi]
What language is 'abouteroon'?


{T4B159}
[£o¢o]
£o¢o-ese.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


128 :

{T4B160}
[£o¢o]
£o¢o-ese~


{T4B161}
[£o¢o]
"Whoah! Obstinate stubbornness! Geezers going 
swimming in the winter!"


{T4B162}
[£o¢o]
There's abouteroo, too~

[Takeshi]
.........


{PIPI_03}
[Pipi]
*Waroof*?

£o¢o was always in upbeat mode...


129 :

{T4B163}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari, didn't you already see Tsugumi when 
she woke up last night?"

[Takeshi]
Well, yeah.

Being asked forced me to remember the night
before.

Tsugumi saying 'I want to die'...

But then she'd eaten three sandwiches...


If she would just recover...

[Takeshi]
"Wait up, Y¤u! You knew that I'd seen 
Tsugumi?"


130 :

{T4B164}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{T4B165}
[Y¤u]
"I heard from Sora this morning. About 
Tsugumi's condition, and your panicked 
running."


{T4B166}
[Y¤u]
"That midnight emergency staircase dash the Kid 
was talking about... the reason was Tsugumi, right?"

[Takeshi]
Alright, you listen here!

[Takeshi]
"A minute ago you were pretending to be a 
reporter, trying to get me to tell you."

[Takeshi]
"Why do you ask about something you already 
know?"


131 :

{T4B167}
[Y¤u]
"It's your fault for trying to be so 
mysterious! Heehee..."

[Takeshi]
Y-y-you little...

I hated to admit it, but she had taken me for
a ride.

And I had no comeback.

[Takeshi]
"So, uh, how do you think Tsugumi's doing? 
Aren't you worried about her?"


132 :

{T4B168}
[Y¤u]
He's trying to change the subject.

[Takeshi]
"Shut up. If you know something, say it 
already."


133 :

{T4B169}
[Y¤u]
"Well, LeMMIH is always watching over the 
infirmary's medical computer data..."


{T4B170}
[Y¤u]
"Since LeMMIH hasn't alerted us to anything, 
it means that Tsugumi is probably 
sleeping peacefully."

[Takeshi]
Well, that's a relief.


134 :
We reached the infirmary.


135 :

{T4B171}
[Kid]
We should have brought flowers.

[Takeshi]
And where do you think you'll find flowers?


136 :

{T4B172}
[Kid]
Oh yeah, that's right!


137 :
Entering first, I mustered a cheerful voice.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
You alive?

[Takeshi]
"I had to force them, but I dragged everyone 
along to see you!"


138 :
Pop!

[Takeshi]
Ow!


139 :

{T4B173}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kuranari, don't be mean like that.

[Takeshi]
...You don't have to push and poke me...

Exchanging stupid banter, we approached the
bed.

[Takeshi]
I did it on purpose, as a joke...

[Takeshi]
"You know, joke around, cheer her up a little 
bit..."


140 :

{T4B174}
[Y¤u]
Really? I don't know...


141 :

{T4B175}
[Kid]
H-hey!


142 :
The Kid had stopped suddenly.

He was pointing at the bed in the back.

[Takeshi]
"What's the matter, Kid? You discover a new 
species or something?"

[Kid]
.........


143 :

{T4B176}
[Kid]
Tsugumi's...


144 :

{T4B177}
[Kid]
Tsugumi's gone...


145 :

{T4B178}
[Y¤u]
What?


{T4B179}
[£o¢o]
Whahoo?

[Takeshi]
What!?


146 :
I ran to the bed in shock.

Everyone followed right behind me.


147 :
[Takeshi]
She...

[Takeshi]
She's gone! She's really not here!

The bed was completely empty.

The covers were just the way they had been.

The pillow was the same.

But the IV tube and the heart monitor had
been torn up and scattered around.

[Takeshi]
What the... Why didn't LeMMIH pick up on this?

[Takeshi]
"LeMMIH was monitoring Tsugumi's data, right, 
Y¤u? What happened?"


{T4B180}
[Y¤u]
I don't know... I have no idea.

She averted her eyes from mine.


{T4B181}
[Y¤u]
Hey...!?


{T4B182}
[Y¤u]
Look at that!

She pointed to the corner of the room.

Her finger was trembling a little.


148 :
[Takeshi]
!?

The cord was torn off the medical computer,
and the monitor had been smashed to pieces.

There had been an electrical short, and there
was a burning stench around the area.


149 :

{T4B183}
[Y¤u]
Who could have done this...?

[Takeshi]
That's what I'd like to know...


150 :

{T4B184}
[£o¢o]
Um, um, what's that?


151 :
£o¢o had found something.

Under the computer console, there were some
bandages and a long, skinny case of some sort.

A white, hard case...


152 :

{T4B185}
[£o¢o]
Is this...?

[Takeshi]
It's Tsugumi's brace, right?


{T4B186}
[Y¤u]
You're right. It's Tsugumi's.


153 :

{T4B187}
[Kid]
Which means...

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi.

[Takeshi]
"She took off her own brace and smashed up the 
computer."

[Takeshi]
"She got out of bed, smashed the computer, and 
then left the room..."

My thoughts leaped right out of my mouth.

It was hard to believe...


154 :

{T4B188}
[£o¢o]
Really!?


{T4B189}
[£o¢o]
"But when I brought her the sandwiches, she 
still looked like she was in pain, in bed..."


155 :

{T4B190}
[£o¢o]
You really think that Tsugumin...?

[Takeshi]
Well, what else could it be?


{T4B191}
[Kid]
Maybe someone ran off with her...?

[Takeshi]
Someone... like who? Who's here besides us?


156 :

{T4B192}
[Y¤u]
It's crazy either way!

Y¤u was shouting.


{T4B193}
[Y¤u]
How could Tsugumi even walk on that leg?


{T4B194}
[Y¤u]
"It was a serious injury! It should take 
over two months to heal!"


157 :

{T4B195}
[Y¤u]
"In fact, in her condition, she shouldn't 
even be able to get out of bed..."


158 :

{T4B196}
[Y¤u]
"And it's strange that LeMMIH didn't respond, 
even if the computer is broken..."


159 :

{T4B197}
[Y¤u]
Even if someone had taken her out of here...


160 :

{T4B198}
[Y¤u]
"The sensor on the ceiling should have picked 
it up..."

Saying that, Y¤u raised her eyes to the
ceiling.


161 :

{T4B199}
[Y¤u]
What in the world...


{T4B200}
[£o¢o]
Wai-wait, then...


{T4B201}
[£o¢o]
What happened to Tsugumin?

£o¢o barely opened her mouth.


{T4B202}
[Kid]
Maybe she was spirited away?


{T4B203}
[Y¤u]
Oh, please...

[Takeshi]
.........

Tsugumi, disappeared...?

We were all in shock.

Everyone kept talking, though.


162 :

{T4B204}
[Y¤u]
Spirited away...?


163 :

{T4B205}
[Y¤u]
I don't believe that...


164 :

{T4B206}
[Y¤u]
I don't believe...

All of the color had drained from Y¤u's face
as she absorbed the enormity of what had
happened.

She was holding her chest, looking up at the
ceiling in a cold sweat.


{T4B207}
[Y¤u]
Uuugh...

[Takeshi]
Calm down, Y¤u.

[Takeshi]
Don't freak out on me. Take deep breaths.


165 :

{T4B208}
[Y¤u]
Uh... Ugh...


{T4B209}
[Y¤u]
Oo... haaa... haa...

She breathed in and out, slowly.

A little color came back to her face.


166 :
But the question was what to do about
the... situation.

What to do?

[Takeshi]
Hey, I know! We'll ask Sora!

[Takeshi]
Where is Sora?

[Takeshi]
She ought to know what happened, right?


167 :
Y¤u looked at me with a glimmer of hope.


{T4B210}
[Y¤u]
Y-yeah, you're right. Let's call her.


168 :
We rushed over to the LeMMIH terminal in the
corner of the room.

Standing in front of the console, Y¤u began
operating the panel.


{T4B211}
[Y¤u]
"If LeMMIH hasn't realized it yet, that may 
mean that Sora doesn't know yet either..."

[Takeshi]
"But call her anyway. It's faster to ask her 
than to go on a blind search."


{T4B212}
[Y¤u]
You're right.

Before long, there was a change in the
terminal.


169 :
Sora's image floated up in the monitor.


{T4B213}
[Sora]
Yes?


{T4B214}
[Y¤u]
"Sora, something terrible has happened. 
Tsugumi is missing..."


{T4B215}
[Sora]
What!? Are you sure?


{T4B216}
[Sora]
"I thought something had happened to the 
monitor in the room, but..."


{T4B217}
[Y¤u]
What!? Why didn't you tell us!?


{T4B218}
[Sora]
"I am terribly sorry. There has been terrible 
jamming, and... it delayed me."

[Takeshi]
Jamming? What's that?


{T4B219}
[Y¤u]
Electromagnetic interference...?


{T4B220}
[Sora]
How is the room? Is everyone there?

[Takeshi]
Yes, other than Tsugumi, we're all here.


{T4B221}
[Sora]
Because, actually, my 'eyes' aren't working.


{T4B222}
[Sora]
So I wasted time trying to confirm...


{T4B223}
[Y¤u]
Don't worry, Sora. We're alright.


{T4B224}
[Y¤u]
Can you come right over?


{T4B225}
[Sora]
Yes, of course. Right away.

Sora disappeared from the monitor...

And instantly, she was standing in front of us.


170 :

{T4B226}
[Sora]
"Am I standing in the right place? Can you 
see me alright?"

Sora looked worried.

[Takeshi]
You're fine... You really can't see?


171 :

{T4B227}
[Sora]
"It is getting better, but there is still 
something wrong."


{T4B228}
[Sora]
"I can tell approximately where you are 
standing, but not which way you are facing..."

She was talking to a spot just next to me.


{T4B229}
[Y¤u]
"Sora, Tsugumi's not in the infirmary. Can 
you search the other rooms?"


172 :

{T4B230}
[Sora]
"Let me try... I'll do a bio scan on the entire 
building."


173 :
She put her hands on the LeMMIH terminal and
started accessing it right away.


174 :

{T4B231}
[Kid]
Hey, hey...


{T4B232}
[Kid]
Who are you guys talking to?

The Kid asked us fearfully from over by the
bed.


175 :
We left the infirmary.

Sora was bewildered by the sudden sensor
trouble. It was taking her a few minutes
longer than usual to finish the bio scan.


176 :

{T4B233}
[Kid]
"Sora wasn't able to see us, and sometimes we 
couldn't see her, so..."


{T4B234}
[Kid]
"Does that mean the ceiling sensors from the 
bed over to the elevator are all temporarily 
broken?"


{T4B235}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. That's what's affecting Sora.


177 :

{T4B236}
[Kid]
So she left through the emergency corridor.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, but Tsugumi was kind enough to 
leave candles burning for us."

When we had found the emergency flares in the
elevator, I was completely shocked.

She wanted to keep us away that badly?


178 :

{T4B237}
[Sora]
"Sorry to keep you waiting. I have the 
results of the bio scan."

After a delay, Sora appeared in the door of
the infirmary.

[Takeshi]
And where has Tsugumi hobbled off to?

She couldn't have gone far... In any case,
we would find her, and when we did, we
would figure everything out.


{T4B238}
[Sora]
"An Ei has gone down to Dritter Stock. 
Komachi-san is slowly moving past the isolated 
sector."

[Takeshi]
"Ei...? Oh, 'Ei'‡Lthe neutral buoyancy 
elevator!"

[Takeshi]
If we call it, Ei will come to us, right?


{T4B239}
[Sora]
Yes.


179 :
[Takeshi]
Okay, I'll run over there.


180 :

{T4B240}
[Y¤u]
What? Hold on, Kuranari...


{T4B241}
[Y¤u]
"You can only enter and exit that sector 
using Ei, so if you just wait a little..."


181 :
[Takeshi]
"We can't just leave her be! What if her injury 
gets worse!?"

[Takeshi]
"And besides, I want to hear a good 
explanation for why she ran off like this!"


182 :
[Takeshi]
"We can't let her be out there. What if her 
injury gets worse?"

[Takeshi]
Why couldn't she just stay in bed...!?


183 :

{T4B242}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari!


{T4B243}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san?


184 :
I left them there and ran out.

The buoyancy elevator was right nearby.


185 :
I pushed the down button and called the
elevator.

The lamp lit up, letting me know that it was
working normally.


186 :
I sprang in when the double doors opened.

The doors shut quickly, and it started going
down.

(If she doesn't use Ei, she can't get up
here...)

(Until I get there, she definitely can't
leave the sector...)

(Alright...)

(Watch out, Tsugumi, because here I come!)

I cracked my knuckles.


187 :
Tsugumi had pushed herself, despite her
injury, and gone off all alone...

Did she really mean to kill herself...?

Was she actually trying...?

I wondered if I should just let her.

But still!

I wanted to give her a piece of my mind first!


I hoped she would just stay alive long enough
for me to tell her all that I wanted to say...


188 :
She was always acting tough...

But I figured she was bawling by now.

And that her leg would be killing her.

She'd gone so far that she probably couldn't
get back even if she wanted to.

Maybe she was regretting it...?

What I really wanted to do was get in a
couple good wisecracks to pay her back for
all the hard times she'd given me...

But I also felt a little sorry for her.


189 :
The doors opened.

The stale air of the isolated sector on the
third floor flowed into my lungs.

Next to the elevator I had ridden in, another
elevator was still stopped.

An elevator with a hole blasted in it...

You couldn't even smell the stench of acetone
anymore.

I walked toward the end of the hallway,
marshaling my wits.


190 :
(What's that...?)

I realized that there was a room on the left
side of the corridor that I hadn't seen
during the power outage.

Thinking to explore a little, I set my foot
inside.


191 :
A huge whale was stretched out.

It said 'Cosmic Whale' on the entrance.


Apparently, that was the name of the
attraction.

I couldn't tell from a quick glance exactly
what the attraction was.

A whale floating in empty space.

The whole scene was surreal.

Was there an explanation written somewhere...?

(...Wait, I don't have time to waste like
this.)

After making sure that Tsugumi wasn't there,
I left through a different door.


192 :
I quickly reached the generator room.

The door said 'Kraftwerk'.

I pushed open the door and stepped inside.


193 :
The facility was giving off a steady but low
hum and seemed to be working fine.

For better or for worse, in LeMU, we didn't
have to worry about the electricity.

I looked around, but there was no trace of
Tsugumi.


194 :
Past the generator room, the corridor was
completely blocked off by a partition.

It was impossible to go beyond it...

The only door left was the room on the right.

I decided to go in there.


195 :
The room was full of pipes.

There was no sign on the door, but I supposed
it would be called something like a 'pressure
regulation room' or something.

I assumed that the pipes must have been connected
to the boilers and turbines in the generator room.

Come to think of it, Tsugumi had done the
repairs in there...


196 :
I remembered her bending down and using
her tools to close off a valve...


197 :
(Huh?)

She was there.

Leaning in just like the time before.

She didn't have any tools. She wasn't closing
off a valve.

Instead, craning her neck, she seemed to be
looking over at the other side of the pipes.


198 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi...

[Takeshi]
What are you doing here?

I pretended to be calm.


199 :
It wouldn't do to lose my temper right off
the bat.

I suppressed the urge to shout. She was
injured, after all...


200 :
I thought to proceed gently.

I wanted to handle the conversation correctly.


201 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


202 :
She stood up slowly and looked my way.

[Takeshi]
You looking for something?


203 :

{T4B244}
[Tsugumi]
No, not really.

She stepped back as if she was keeping watch
over me.

I could tell that she was agitated...

She hadn't expected to see me.

Her gaze didn't fix on anything...

Her eyes kept flitting to the pipes behind her.

Her gaze...

It bothered me...

[Takeshi]
What's behind you?


204 :

{T4B245}
[Tsugumi]
...N-nothing...


{T4B246}
[Tsugumi]
There's nothing behind me.

[Takeshi]
Really?

I casually tried to angle around so that I
could see the pipes behind her.


205 :

{T4B247}
[Tsugumi]
Don't come near me...


{T4B248}
[Tsugumi]
Don't get close...

What?

She changed position.

She didn't want me to go behind her.


206 :

{T4B249}
[Tsugumi]
Oh...


207 :
She had taken another step back and knocked
something off.


208 :
Clang, clang, plunk...

Along with a small splash of water, several
screws or nuts fell into the crevice between
ducts.


209 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


210 :
She quietly looked around.

Favoring her right leg, she slowly turned...


With her back to me, she looked farther back
into the room.


211 :
Then took a relieved, if amazed, breath...


(What's going on?)

Then, pushing me aside, she tried to head out
of the room.


212 :

{T4B250}
[Tsugumi]
...Move. You're in my way.

[Takeshi]
H-hey, Tsugumi...?


213 :

{T4B251}
[Tsugumi]
Don't bother me...


214 :
Dragging her right leg, she tried to leave.

[Takeshi]
Wait!

I put my hands on her shoulders.


215 :
But she shook them right off.


216 :

{T4B252}
[Tsugumi]
Don't you touch me!

She glared at me, without trying to hide her
annoyance.


{T4B253}
[Tsugumi]
I said you were in my way!


{T4B254}
[Tsugumi]
Leave me alone!


{T4B255}
[Tsugumi]
Why are you following me?

She spat the words out all at once.

But I didn't let up and fired a question back
at her.

[Takeshi]
"What are you doing here? Are you looking for 
something?"

[Takeshi]
Or are you finishing up some repairs?


217 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"You won't answer stupid questions, is that 
it?"


218 :

{T4B256}
[Tsugumi]
...What...


219 :

{T4B257}
[Tsugumi]
What are you doing here yourself?


{T4B258}
[Tsugumi]
I'm free to do what I want, where I want.

She was trying to make a wall of words.


220 :
[Takeshi]
Sure...

I shot back, trying to make a crack in the
wall that she had up.

[Takeshi]
I came here on my own. I left the others.

[Takeshi]
"Because I heard that you came here on your 
own."


221 :

{T4B259}
[Tsugumi]
Why... would you do that...?

[Takeshi]
"Because my injured friend suddenly went missing, 
that's why!"

[Takeshi]
Of course I came looking for you!


222 :
[Takeshi]
Listen...

Searching for a way to reach her.

[Takeshi]
...I just came out of basic human decency.

[Takeshi]
"It's not like everyone's happy about the way 
you keep doing things."

[Takeshi]
"Because my injured friend suddenly went 
missing, that's why..."

[Takeshi]
Of course I came looking for you.


223 :

{T4B260}
[Tsugumi]
Friend?

Her expression grew more and more severe.


{T4B261}
[Tsugumi]
"I didn't ask you to come, and there's no 
reason for you to be here."


{T4B262}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not like the others.


{T4B263}
[Tsugumi]
So don't treat me like one of your gang.


224 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! Cut it out!

I snapped.

I clenched my fist.

Then I shoved it in her face.

But I stopped it just in front of her nose...

[Tsugumi]
.........

She didn't even flinch.

[Takeshi]
Agh...


225 :
[Takeshi]
Alright, I get it!

[Takeshi]
You're so unbelievably selfish...!

I thought about pretending to raise my fist,
but didn't do it.

[Tsugumi]
.........

Even if I did, she probably wouldn't flinch.


[Takeshi]
Agh...


226 :
[Takeshi]
"Believe me, I don't want to be friends with 
someone like you."

[Takeshi]
But we don't have a choice.

[Takeshi]
We all want to get out of here!

[Takeshi]
"Don't you want to get out of here as soon as 
possible?"

[Takeshi]
"As long as we're in the same boat, we're 
friends."

[Takeshi]
"In Japan, people with the same goal are 
called friends..."


{T4B264}
[Tsugumi]
Friends!?


227 :

{T4B265}
[Tsugumi]
Friends, friends, friends, friends...


{T4B266}
[Tsugumi]
There you go again, just saying that.


228 :

{T4B267}
[Tsugumi]
"That kind of tired, hypocritical crap makes 
me sick."

[Takeshi]
.........


229 :
Tsugumi's voice stayed completely cool.

There was no place for my raised fist to go.


230 :

{T4B268}
[Tsugumi]
And one more thing.


{T4B269}
[Tsugumi]
Weren't you listening to me yesterday?


231 :

{T4B270}
[Tsugumi]
I don't want to escape.


{T4B271}
[Tsugumi]
So I'm not your 'friend'.


232 :

{T4B272}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't care if you're from Germany, 
America, or Japan."


{T4B273}
[Tsugumi]
Got it?


233 :

{T4B274}
[Tsugumi]
I. Am. Not. Your. Friend.


{T4B275}
[Tsugumi]
So. Do. Not. Talk. To. Me. Again.

[Takeshi]
.........


234 :
I lowered my hand.

I couldn't say anything.


235 :

{T4B276}
[Tsugumi]
...Move.

I moved aside.


236 :
Giving me a glance, she moved toward the door
dragging her foot.

She was moving awkwardly...

Still dragging her left foot...

Left foot...

Left foot!?

Did I say LEFT foot!?

[Takeshi]
Whoah, whoah, whoah! Wait a second!

I yelled with all my might.


237 :

{T4B277}
[Tsugumi]
What!? I said don't talk to me!

She turned around forcefully.

[Takeshi]
Your foot...


238 :

{T4B278}
[Tsugumi]
What?

[Takeshi]
Your foot...

[Takeshi]
...Is it alright?


239 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"The leg you hurt the other day... was your 
right leg, wasn't it?"


240 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Her face stiffened.

Her eyes flicked away.

She averted her gaze.

She stood rock still.

What was...

...Going on?

[Takeshi]
Let me see.


241 :
I grabbed the hem of her skirt.


242 :
And without hesitating, yanked it up‡L


243 :

{T4B279}
[Tsugumi]
!


244 :
‡LWhack!

An immediate, brutal slap...

[Takeshi]
.........


245 :
Tsugumi took off running.

The sound of her footfalls grew faint. As
did her shadow, disappearing down the hallway.

What was left was me, stunned.


246 :
She had hammered my cheek.

I might have had broken teeth.

I might have had a nosebleed.

She hit me so hard my brain rattled.

But I didn't feel any pain...

(Complex fracture of the right femur.)

(Injuries requiring 40 stitches‡L)

(And she could run a day later...?)


247 :

{T4B280}
[Sora]
Welcome back, Kuranari-san.

Sora greeted me as I stepped out of the
elevator into Zweiter Stock.

[Takeshi]
Thanks.


{T4B281}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... your face is swollen...

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I know.


248 :
Sora readied a compress for me back in the
infirmary.

I left the room holding it.


249 :

{T4B282}
[Sora]
"It seems that Komachi-san will come back to this 
floor in a little while."


{T4B283}
[Sora]
But...


250 :

{T4B284}
[Sora]
"But if we do find her, try not to get mad or 
yell at her."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


251 :

{T4B285}
[Sora]
"For a little while, I think it is best if we 
let her do as she wants."

[Takeshi]
But... why?

I pressed the compress to my cheek.

It started to hurt right about the time I had
forgotten about it...


{T4B286}
[Sora]
"Don't you think she might be quite nervous 
right now?"


{T4B287}
[Sora]
She's thinking about things...


{T4B288}
[Sora]
"She's pondering all sorts of things in her 
heart..."


{T4B289}
[Sora]
Everyone's words will fall on deaf ears...


{T4B290}
[Sora]
"She's not able yet to just listen. Of 
course..."


252 :

{T4B291}
[Sora]
"You're worried about her injuries, but for a 
little while, let's leave her alone."


{T4B292}
[Sora]
"If she is in any serious danger, I will let 
you know right away."


{T4B293}
[Sora]
"So for just a little while... Please, 
Kuranari-san."

[Takeshi]
Ah... Alright.

I nodded my assent to Sora's earnest request.


253 :
I went slowly down the stairs of Dritter Stock.


My footsteps echoed quietly.


254 :

{T4B294}
[Sora]
"I don't think it is an accident that she 
came to be here."

Sora continued speaking right next to me.

[Takeshi]
Not an accident?


{T4B295}
[Sora]
I do not know the details.


{T4B296}
[Sora]
"This is the first time for me to encounter a 
case like hers. I don't have any data for 
this..."


{T4B297}
[Sora]
But it seems to me that she has her reasons.


{T4B298}
[Sora]
Reasons that are difficult to explain...


{T4B299}
[Sora]
"Something that is hard for others to 
understand..."


{T4B300}
[Sora]
"Something that compelled her to act even if 
it made her injuries worse..."


{T4B301}
[Sora]
That's what I feel.


255 :

{T4B302}
[Sora]
Earlier, Tanaka-san was saying the same thing.

[Takeshi]
Y¤u?


{T4B303}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T4B304}
[Sora]
"That we shouldn't probe. That until she 
wants to tell us, we shouldn't press for 
information..."

[Takeshi]
I see...

Maybe I had gotten a little too close to her
boundaries.

Boundaries she didn't want invaded.

Whatever feelings and reasons she didn't want
us to know about.

Was that why I was warned, harassed, and
pummeled...?

If I thought about it that way, it made more
sense.

[Takeshi]
"Well... Maybe so. Maybe I came down too 
hard..."


256 :
At last, we reached the third floor.

I had heard from Sora that Y¤u and the Kid
were holed up in the central control room
because she wanted to figure something out.

She said that £o¢o and Pipi had gone off
somewhere on a walk.

[Takeshi]
Hmmm... Wonder where they went?

When I asked Sora that, she put her finger to
her lips and smiled.


{T4B305}
[Sora]
Shall we say, individual study time?


257 :
We were the only ones in the conference room.

Study time...

Sora turned over the observation of LeMU to
the automatic LeMMIH control system for a few
hours.

That would ensure Tsugumi and Y¤u some
privacy...

And give Sora a break too.

So there she sat, in a chair in the
conference room, looking at the white board.

I stood at the whiteboard, dry marker in hand,
playing professor.

A private lesson, one-on-one.

The reason we started that was...


'£o¢o-chan and Kid-san were giving rave reviews of
Tanaka-san's speech...'

'What was it like?', I asked her, but she
wouldn't tell me.

'Kuranari-san, do you know?'

'Well, yeah, but... it's not like I have the
whole thing memorized...'

'I know, I'll give you a lecture just as
good... no, better than Y¤u's!'

‡LAnd that was how it started.

The title of my lecture was 'The Psychology of
Love'...

I was playing to the crowd.

But I hadn't decided what I would talk about.

It was all ad lib.

[Takeshi]
Let's see...

[Takeshi]
When is your birthday, Akanegasaki-kun?

I would just choose a random starting point.


258 :

{T4B306}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san? What do you...

[Takeshi]
No, no, no, no...

I wagged my finger in front of my face. Then...

[Takeshi]
Akanegasaki-kun.

I said that while pointing at Sora.

[Takeshi]
Professor Kuranari.

I said, and pointed at myself.

[Takeshi]
<You understand? Okay?>


259 :

{T4B307}
[Sora]
<O-okay...>

She nodded.


260 :

{T4B308}
[Sora]
Professor Kuranari.

[Takeshi]
Very good. Once again.

[Takeshi]
When is your birthday, Akanegasaki-kun?


261 :

{T4B309}
[Sora]
"Development of LeMMIH started on September 
16th, 1992."


{T4B310}
[Sora]
"The prototype was finished in October of 
2000."


{T4B311}
[Sora]
"Actual operation of the 'Sora' RSD System 
began in April, 11 years later."


{T4B312}
[Sora]
Which means that I was born on April 2nd, 2011.

[Takeshi]
2011?

[Takeshi]
"Oh my, oh my, what a very young student you 
are..."

[Takeshi]
Wait, you're only six years old?


262 :

{T4B313}
[Sora]
No, I'm 24.

[Takeshi]
How's that?


{T4B314}
[Sora]
I am not sure of the reason myself.


{T4B315}
[Sora]
"This year and last, even three and four 
years ago, I've been 24."


{T4B316}
[Sora]
I've been 24 since I was born.


{T4B317}
[Sora]
Of course, it's just my programmed age...


{T4B318}
[Sora]
I don't actually age like humans do...


{T4B319}
[Sora]
So I'll always be 24, eternally, I'm afraid.

I had to admit it would have been strange to
hear her say 'I'm 41' looking the way she did.

They must have predicted that such a time
would come and fixed her eternally at 24.

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay...

[Takeshi]
"I see. Then I shall accept that you are 24, 
Akanegasaki-kun."

[Takeshi]
"In that case, I think that you should learn 
the appropriate behavior for someone your 
age."


263 :

{T4B320}
[Sora]
Um...

She cocked her head to the side, a little
bewildered.


{T4B321}
[Sora]
You mean that I don't seem 24 right now?

[Takeshi]
Yes, that is exactly my point...

[Takeshi]
Your average 24-year-old is...

[Takeshi]
Um... More... How can I say...

[Takeshi]
Has a bit more... sparkle.


264 :

{T4B322}
[Sora]
Sparkle?


265 :

{T4B323}
[Sora]
"Are you saying that my face should be more 
shiny?"

[Takeshi]
No, no, that's not what I mean...

[Takeshi]
24 is when you start thinking about marriage.


266 :

{T4B324}
[Sora]
Ah... Marriage.

[Takeshi]
"You become friends with someone at 24, then 
date for a few years, and marry around 26 or 
27."

[Takeshi]
That's the key, marrying into moolah.


{T4B325}
[Sora]
Moolah?


{T4B326}
[Sora]
Does that have to do with cows?

[Takeshi]
No, no...

[Takeshi]
I guess my reference was a little dated...

[Takeshi]
Listen up, you're asking too many questions!

[Takeshi]
Be quiet until your teacher stops talking!

[Takeshi]
I'll take all questions at the end. Alright?


267 :
Sora nodded silently.

[Takeshi]
Ahem.

[Takeshi]
Now then, to go back to what I was saying...

[Takeshi]
Sparkle means...

[Takeshi]
"It's the gleam in your eyes as you 
frantically search for the object of your 
affection. All, of course, as a preamble to 
getting married."

[Takeshi]
That is what I am speaking of.

[Takeshi]
"Until 23, you choose a man who will be an 
appropriate boyfriend."

[Takeshi]
"After 24, you choose a man who will be an 
appropriate husband."

[Takeshi]
"You might think that an appropriate husband 
would be one who promises a bright future..."

[Takeshi]
"But to borrow the words of the ancients, it 
all comes down to the three 'heights'."

[Takeshi]
High education, high salary, high in stature.

[Takeshi]
That would be the ideal individual...

[Takeshi]
"You think there's really guys like that out 
there...?"

[Takeshi]
"If you're feeling greedy, you might also 
look for someone who's kind, handsome, and 
cares more about his family than his job."

[Takeshi]
Ah... In other words...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah right! You could search the whole world and 
never find a guy like that!"

[Sora]
.........


268 :

{T4B327}
[Sora]
Professor, you seem upset...

[Takeshi]
Sorry, it's a little traumatic...

[Takeshi]
Ahem. Excuse me.

[Takeshi]
"So because of all that, the 24-year-old 
woman can be a very severe creature."

[Takeshi]
Clever and calculating.

[Takeshi]
"And in order to bring down her prey, she 
must have the social skills of a little devil."

[Takeshi]
Do you understand?

[Sora]
.........


269 :
She cocked her head.

I wanted to sigh, but I pulled myself
together to make a declaration.

[Takeshi]
"Well, perhaps it is better if you put this 
theory into practice."

[Takeshi]
Let us try it.


270 :

{T4B328}
[Sora]
Alright, Kuranari-san.

[Takeshi]
Professor.


{T4B329}
[Sora]
"Yes, Professor Kuranari. I will try my very 
best."

[Takeshi]
No, no, no, no...

[Takeshi]
That kind of talk is a no-no.


271 :

{T4B330}
[Sora]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Not 'Yes, I will try my very best', but...

[Takeshi]
More, you know, devilishly! Coquettishly!

[Takeshi]
One, two, three, go!


272 :

{T4B331}
[Sora]
"The hell!? 'ssif I can do som'n like that 
right away!? I'll kill you, you bastard! 
Bwa, bwa, bwaawkk."

[Takeshi]
N-no, no, that's all wrong.

[Takeshi]
That's not devilish, it's downright demonic.

[Takeshi]
And that's not coquetry, that's poultry.


273 :

{T4B332}
[Sora]
"Professor, this is bit too difficult for me 
to start with."

[Takeshi]
Really.


{T4B333}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Takeshi]
"Alright then, how about you start by not 
speaking so formally?"


274 :

{T4B334}
[Sora]
"Yes, something like that will be better. 
Something easier."

[Takeshi]
Using the same example...

[Takeshi]
Yes, I will try my very best.

[Takeshi]
"In casual conversation, this would be 'Sure, 
I'll give it a try.'"


{T4B335}
[Sora]
Sure, I'll give it a try.

[Takeshi]
See, you can do it if you try!


275 :
Sora's face lit up with a smile...


{T4B336}
[Sora]
This is interesting! Please teach me more.

Her eyes shone...

[Takeshi]
'This is, like, sooo fun!'... Now you try.


276 :

{T4B337}
[Sora]
This is, like, sooo fun!

We did that for several hours...

.........

......

...


277 :
[Takeshi]
"Alright! The time has come to see the 
fruits of your labor!"

[Takeshi]
Go forth, my prized pupil!


278 :
£o¢o and Pipi were jumping up and down in the
rest area.


279 :

{T4B338}
[£o¢o]
Oh, Sooora-san~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof*!


280 :

{T4B339}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Sora-san, Sora-san? Did you find Tsugumin?


{T4B340}
[Sora]
Hunh? Tsugumi? I haven't seen her...


281 :

{T4B341}
[Sora]
"Anywayz, £o¢o, don'tcha know any cute guys 
you could hook me up with?"


{T4B342}
[Sora]
"The guys at this party last week were, like, 
such losers..."


{T4B343}
[£o¢o]
So-So-So-Sora-san...?


282 :

{T4B344}
[Sora]
"I was like, I'm sicka eldest sons, man! I 
want something fresh!"


283 :

{T4B345}
[Sora]
And then they wanted to go Dutch.


{T4B346}
[Sora]
Can you believe it? It's, like, total junk!?


284 :
[£o¢o]
.........


285 :

{T4B347}
[£o¢o]
Waaaaaahhhhhhh...

£o¢o burst into tears.


{PIPI_24}
[Pipi]
*Grr*... *grr*... *grr*...

Pipi let out a terrified growl.


286 :

{T4B348}
[Sora]
Whah, what's the matter?


287 :

{T4B349}
[Sora]
You don't like my new way of talking?


288 :

{T4B350}
[Y¤u]
Hey, what's going on?


289 :
Y¤u came running.


290 :

{T4B351}
[Sora]
Oh, hey, it's Y¤u!


{T4B352}
[Sora]
"I haven't heard from you for, like, forever, 
girl. What, are you like, busy like a bee or 
something?"


291 :

{T4B353}
[Y¤u]
...Eeeh!?


{T4B354}
[Y¤u]
What's happened to you, Sora...?


292 :

{T4B355}
[Sora]
What're you lookin' all scared for?


{T4B356}
[Sora]
"Really, how NOT cool. Hurry up and put an 
end to your work then..."


293 :

{T4B357}
[Sora]
"You wanna go clubbing or something? Don't 
you just wanna stay out ALL night?"


294 :
[Y¤u]
.........


295 :

{T4B358}
[Y¤u]
!?


296 :

{T4B359}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari! Did you do this!?


297 :
So...

Due to the general outcry, Sora went back to
talking like her original self...
