1 :
The next thing I knew, I was on a bed.

The ceiling was so white that it was
slightly blinding...

It smelled of disinfectant...

I wondered where I was.


{S1A000}
[???]
Are you awake now?


2 :
A shadow passed above me on the bed.


I wondered who it could be...

(No... Wait a minute...)

Somewhere...

I felt like... I had met that person
somewhere before.


{S1A001}
[???]
How are you doing?


{S1A002}
[???]
You look... alright enough.

Who? Who was it?

I knew her.

I was sure that I knew her.

Still, I couldn't put my finger on any
one thing about her that I knew.

The more I thought about it, the more
the area around my temples pounded
with pain.


3 :

{S1A003}
[???]
Oh? I guess it's no good then?


{S1A004}
[???]
Does your head... hurt?

I pressed my temples with the fingers
of both hands, nodding slightly.


4 :

{S1A005}
[???]
I see. Just wait a second, alright?


{S1A006}
[???]
I'll try to find some painkillers.

She laughed sweetly and stepped away
from me.


5 :
I raised myself up and looked around.

The room was completely white...

With a number of beds tidily lined up
in a row...

Looking behind me, there was a curved
glass window in the wall.

I got off the bed and put on my shoes,
which were neatly arranged below me.
I approached the window.


6 :
Outside, as far as the eye could see,
was one endless sheet of blue.

Transparent waves of light swayed
gently in the dense, deep navy mist.

I put both of my hands on the wall and
pushed my face up against the glass.

Just then‡La flash of silver light
darted across my vision.

For an instant, I was afraid.
Then I noticed it was just a fish.

[Kid]
This is...

[Kid]
...the middle of the ocean.


{S1A007}
[???]
What's the matter?


7 :
At some point, the girl had come to
stand beside me.


8 :

{S1A008}
[???]
Of course it is!


{S1A009}
[???]
This is the LeMU infirmary.


9 :
‡LLeMU!

The instant I heard that word, a flash
of searing light reappeared in the back
of my mind.

That was right! That was right!

I had come to LeMU!


10 :
The theme park LeMU floating in the
ocean!

And I had been walking around LeMU
with her.


11 :
There were ancient ruins...{1}

12 :
The whale floating in the darkness...{1}

13 :
The Jellyfish Gondola...{1}

14 :
And merry-go-round...


15 :
But...


16 :
But... why had I come to that place... To
LeMU?

Had I come for fun?

Of course I had. It was a theme park,
after all...

But was that right? Was that really
the reason?

Violent head pains struck me again.

I shook my head again and again, my
face distorted from the pain.


17 :

{S1A010}
[???]
Hey... Are you alright?


18 :

{S1A011}
[???]
Shouldn't you rest a little more?


19 :
She helped support me as I returned
to the bed.


20 :

{S1A012}
[???]
I brought you some headache medicine.

She held two white pills in her left
hand. In her right was a cup filled
with water.

White, white pills, two of them...

21 :
{11:0-2c}
{11:1}Thanks

{11:1}No thanks


22 :
[Kid]
Thanks...

I took the pills and gulped them down.


23 :
[Kid]
No thanks...

I replied instantly.

I looked away from her hand.


24 :

{S1A013}
[???]
"What's the matter? Your head hurts,
right?"

[Kid]
Yeah...


{S1A014}
[???]
"Well, if you don't take these... the pain
won't go away."

[Kid]
...

Pain continued to throb through my
skull.

The pills in her hand would help to
ease that pain...

I understood all of that.

Yet, for some reason...

For some reason, I wanted to look away
from the medicine...


25 :

{S1A015}
[???]
Oh, I get it!


{S1A016}
[???]
I see, you...


{S1A017}
[???]
You don't like the taste, right?

[Kid]
...


{S1A018}
[???]
That's kind of sad.


{S1A019}
[???]
"But that's okay. This medicine isn't bitter 
at all."


{S1A020}
[???]
"It's more than not bitter. It's got a mellow, 
sweet, full flavor that floods throughout 
the mouth without an aftertaste..."

[Kid]
Ooouccch...

My headache had gotten worse.


{S1A021}
[???]
I told you so.


{S1A022}
[???]
"If you REALLY can't swallow it, then I can give 
it to you anally via a suppository."

For an instant, I feared my chastity
might be violated and grabbed the belt
of my pants.

[Kid]
A-alright. I'll take it... I'll take it.

Feeling half-threatened, I downed the
medicine even though I didn't want to.

It was super bitter.


26 :

{S1A023}
[???]
"It's probably just mild barotrauma,
or decompression sickness."

{S1A024}
[???]
It happens a lot to visitors...


{S1A025}
[???]
"They just feel ill all of a sudden and get carted 
in here..."

She said that as she slyly took the cup
from my hand.

I sank my head back into the fluffy
pillow.


{S1A026}
[???]
It's a bit rough coming down here anyway.


{S1A027}
[???]
"People with no experience just jumping to six 
atmospheres for long periods of time. Sheesh."


{S1A028}
[???]
"The air pressure in the earth's atmosphere is 
made for people to live comfortably."


{S1A029}
[???]
"Of course people are going to have bad 
reactions to breathing air this thick."


{S1A030}
[???]
"Air and first love; both should be light.
No doubt about that."


{S1A031}
[???]
"Coffee and your first TIME...
those, of course, are better thick."

[Kid]
...Huh?

She touched my face with the palm of her hand.

The backs of her slender fingers stroked
my cheek.

The smooth texture of her skin slipped down
from my neck to above my chest, stopping
there.


{S1A032}
[???]
It's alright. You don't seem to have a fever.

She smiled at me.

Somehow, I felt all embarrassed. I pulled the
bedcover up to my eyes and hid my face.


{S1A033}
[???]
Just rest like that for a while. Okay?


{S1A034}
[???]
I'll go see what's going on outside.

[Kid]
Outside?


27 :

{S1A035}
[???]
Yes... How should I put this?


{S1A036}
[???]
"While you were asleep, it seems that there 
was a bit of trouble..."

[Kid]
?


28 :

{S1A037}
[???]
Well, I'll explain it later.


{S1A038}
[???]
"Anyway, just rest and don't worry about
anything for now. Okay?"

Seeing me nod, she walked away from the bed.

[Kid]
Uh, hey! Wait a second!


{S1A039}
[???]
What?

[Kid]
Just let me ask you one thing.


{S1A040}
[???]
What might that be?

[Kid]
Why... am I here?

[Kid]
"You just told me that this is the LeMU 
infirmary... right?"


{S1A041}
[???]
"You passed out all of a sudden at the kiosk
on Zweiter Stock."


{S1A042}
[???]
And then some guy and I... hauled you here...


{S1A043}
[???]
You don't remember what happened?

Kiosk... At the kiosk...

In front of a big window...

A sweet... A sweet smell...

Something covering my body...

The lemur mascot...


29 :

{S1A044}
[???]
You... You hit me!

30 :
That's right! I remember!

And I was struck dizzy...

Like something being stolen away... I lost
consciousness... and...


{S1A045}
[???]
So? Do you remember?

[Kid]
Y-yes...


{S1A046}
[???]
Do you have any other questions?

I shook my head and answered.


{S1A047}
[???]
Well, be a good boy and wait here, alright?


{S1A048}
[???]
I'll be right back.


31 :
She patted my head gently and began
walking for the door.

While I turned my head to stare at her back...


32 :
'My last name is Tanaka...'

'And my first name is Y¤u...'

'My real name is much longer, though.'

'But it's such a pain... Just call me 'Y¤u'.'

I remembered her words.


33 :
Y¤u turned at the door and looked back at me,
lifting her hand to wave, and left the
infirmary.


34 :
All alone inside the quiet room, it was like
time had stopped.

I didn't know if the medicine had started to
work or not, but my headache was completely
gone.

As I stared at the ceiling, I thought.

I thought about the events leading to my being
in that bed...

.........


35 :
Before I passed out,

I had been walking around LeMU with Y¤u.

We had gone to a shop and were talking...

Then we rode an egg-shaped elevator up
two floors.

Before I had met Y¤u, I had been
in a small park.

{16:4}

36 :
I was on a bench in that park...

I was... waiting for someone.

Who? Who was I waiting for?

{1}

I didn't know.

{1}

My memory was a fog, and thinking about events
after that would make my mind seemingly cloud over.


I shook my head several times, trying to clear
it and concentrate.

{16:4}

37 :
Why was I there?

Why had I come to LeMU?

Did I come alone? Or was I with someone else?

What was I doing before I came to LeMU?

How had I arrived at the amusement park?

{16:4}

38 :
.........

[Kid]
It's no use...

[Kid]
I can't remember...

The thread of my memory was cut off right there.


I couldn't recall anything beyond that time on
the park bench enjoying ice cream...

It was like getting lost in a forest and
going to turn back only to discover that
everything had gone dark...

I felt very strange.

It felt just like I was in the middle of
a dream.

I felt like I had lost something. Something
very important.

But I didn't know what that something was.

And not being able to move forward made me
feel that it was specifically because
I had lost something important.

I felt an unpleasant sense of something
lacking...

And that sense of something not being quite right
irritated me.

I took my right hand out from under the blanket
and stared dreamily at my palm.

The countless wrinkles etched there...
intertwining, reaching out like the branches
of a tree in complicated patterns...

The pinkish skin... and buried deeper, the
slightly blue veins...

And... five fingers...

(Had my hand had always had this strange
shape?)

Bizarre thoughts hit me from nowhere.

No, my right palm was no different than it
had ever been.

Yet, for some reason, I felt that I had to
doubt even that natural fact.

Maybe, just maybe, until a few hours ago,
I might have had six fingers...

Or seven, or maybe even eight...

I felt like something was wrong.

Could I have been feeling that way because...
I lost something special?

I opened and closed my hand a few times... just
repeating that meaningless, simple exercise.


I wandered in the forest.

Searching for that one lost finger...


39 :
The door to the infirmary opened, and Y¤u
returned.

Y¤u dashed into the room and ran toward me
as if she was going to bowl me over...


40 :

{S1A049}
[Y¤u]
"What are you doing? This is no time to be 
sleeping!"

She shouted at me suddenly.

[Kid]
?

Completely clueless, I simply laid
there in a daze.


{S1A050}
[Y¤u]
Get up! Hurry!

Y¤u peeled away the blanket and dragged me
off of the bed.

[Kid]
What... What's the matter?


{S1A051}
[Y¤u]
I dunno!


41 :

{S1A052}
[Y¤u]
"I dunno, but... Anyway, we've gotta escape 
from here!"

Y¤u had a panicked expression.

The relaxed look that had been on her face
just a while ago had vanished completely.

[Kid]
Escape... to where?


42 :

{S1A053}
[Y¤u]
There's only one place!


{S1A054}
[Y¤u]
The floating island on the ocean!

[Kid]
Why?


{S1A055}
[Y¤u]
Because I say so! Don't ask questions!


{S1A056}
[Y¤u]
We're escaping because we have to escape!


43 :
There was something urgent and powerful in
Y¤u's words.

She dragged me along...

I felt a sharp sense of crisis from her powerful grip.


I hurriedly slipped on my sneakers and fled
out of the room with her.


44 :
The instant we emerged into the sprawling
corridor, my feet stopped.

I sucked in my breath, my body froze, and I
just stared at the light spreading before me.

There was something missing.

People... sound... warmth...

[Kid]
No way... This can't be...

The words I muttered were devoured by the
eerie silence.

Looking back and forth in the corridor...
even in the furthest direction, there was
no sign of anyone.

Just the man-made walls on both sides...

Unnatural light, whiter than white, shone
from the ceiling and gave off a cold light.

[Kid]
Wh-why...

[Kid]
Why... isn't anyone here...?


45 :

{S1A057}
[Y¤u]
You get it now?


{S1A058}
[Y¤u]
That's why we have to escape.

[Kid]
Everyone... Where could everyone be...?


46 :

{S1A059}
[Y¤u]
Do you think they're playing hide and seek?

[Kid]
.........


47 :

{S1A060}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, there's no time to think about 
it now."


{S1A061}
[Y¤u]
We need to get out of here as soon as possible, or...


48 :
Saying that, Y¤u again tugged my arm.

Hunched over and on the verge of tripping,
I let Y¤u lead me through the wide corridors
as we ran.


49 :
Our footsteps were the only sound echoing
in the quiet complex.

The more we ran, the more out of breath
I became. My heart was pounding.

Everything just felt like a dream.

A nightmare in which some unknown monster was
chasing us everywhere...

With no clue as to the identity of the
monster nor why we needed to escape.

Hair-raising fear rose within me, and I was
powerless to do anything. I simply cowered.

In a world devoid of people...

Among faded colors...

Just Y¤u's palms grasped my arm...

Only the certainty of her touch, that one
point of contact, allowed me to retain any
connection with reality.


50 :
Finally, we arrived in front of the elevator.

Y¤u rushed to the front of the door and pushed
the up button.


51 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

The button was unlit.


52 :

{S1A062}
[Y¤u]
No way! You've got to be kidding!


{S1A063}
[Y¤u]
Why is this thing stopped!?


53 :
Y¤u struck the button repeatedly.

But nothing happened. The light stayed off.

There was no sign that the floor display above
the elevator doors was functioning either.

[Kid]
"Hey! Aren't there any emergency stairs or 
anything?"


54 :
Y¤u looked back and shifted her eyes around
as if she was thinking...


55 :

{S1A064}
[Y¤u]
Follow me!


56 :
Saying only that, she dashed off.


57 :
...Straight down that long, stretching corridor.


Y¤u turned her head to the left and right,
looking for something.

It looked like she soon found what she was
looking for.

And she headed toward it single-mindedly.


A ladder... Next to it, the words 'Ausgang/Emergency 
Exit' were written in straight red letters with
an arrow pointing upward.

At the other end of the ladder was the ceiling
and a sturdy looking door with a round-shaped
handle attached to it.

[Kid]
Are there emergency stairs on the other side?

Without answering, Y¤u started climbing
the ladder.


58 :
She turned the handle and opened the door.


59 :

{S1A065}
[Y¤u]
Now, hurry!


60 :

{S1A066}
[Y¤u]
This is an emergency escape corridor.


{S1A067}
[Y¤u]
"There are emergency stairs that 
run along it."

Y¤u told me that quickly while we ran.

The corridor stretched in a gentle arc so
that the far end was not visible.

The scenery was repetitive, and I began to have
delusions that I was running in place.


(Where in the world am I right now?)

(How far do I have to run?)

I just had to trust in Y¤u and chase after
her back.


61 :
Suddenly, Y¤u turned right.

Inertia kept me going forward. Afraid I would
miss the turn, I grabbed the corner with my
hand, yanking myself around and chasing after
Y¤u again.

The route had become straight.

Immediately to the left, a green colored sign
for emergency stairs was lit up.

Below the light was a closed door...

Y¤u jumped toward the door's handle.


62 :

{S1A068}
[Y¤u]
Hurrfff... hurrffff...


{S1A069}
[Y¤u]
This is stiff... This is so...

Y¤u was desperately trying to turn the handle...


[Kid]
It won't open?


63 :

{S1A070}
[Y¤u]
"It'll open! It'll open for sure! I'll make 
it open!"


64 :

{S1A071}
[Y¤u]
"Well, don't just stand there. Get over here 
and help me!"


65 :
Spurred by her words, I firmly grabbed onto
the handle.

I tried with all my might to turn it in the
direction of the arrow that said 'Öffnen / Open'.


[Kid]
Damn... What's with this...

[Kid]
It... won't budge... at all...

It was stuck fast, almost as if it had been
welded shut. It didn't look like it would move
to the right or left.


66 :

{S1A072}
[Y¤u]
We'll try to turn it when I say 'Ready, go.'


{S1A073}
[Y¤u]
Okay?


{S1A074}
[Y¤u]
Ready, go!


67 :
With that, I threw my complete weight onto the
handle.

[Kid]
Ummmpphh... Damn...

[Kid]
OPENNNNNNNN!


68 :
‡LJust then!


69 :
A sound arose as if from inside the earth,
echoing heavily from somewhere.

Y¤u and I relaxed our grips and looked at
each other.


70 :

{S1A075}
[Y¤u]
What...? What was that sound...?


71 :
The walls shook.

A small vibration shook the handle we
had grabbed.

The lights on the ceiling flashed
irregularly...

The metal mesh floor was clanging against
itself.

[Kid]
An... earthquake...?


72 :

{S1A076}
[Y¤u]
It couldn't be...


{S1A077}
[Y¤u]
We're...


73 :

{S1A078}
[Y¤u]
We're...


74 :

{S1A079}
[Y¤u]
In the middle of the ocean, after all...


75 :
The vibration gradually increased in
intensity.


76 :
The squeaking sound of steel against steel
shocked our ears.

Y¤u and I held our breath, waiting still.

We tried to focus, sharpening our senses,
our eyes wandering the void.

A low growling sound...

Like the groan of a monster...

A monster... approaching...

A voice filled with hate and rage turned to a
howling roar, sending shivers up my spine.

[Kid]
Where is that coming from!?


77 :

{S1A080}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
Where? Where is it coming from?


{S1A081}
[Y¤u]
What!?

Y¤u's voice approached a scream.

Her face lost all color... and her lips
went dry...

The eyes behind her silky, swaying bangs
looked as if they were about to cry.

(...Silky... swaying... bangs?)

[Kid]
Wind...

[Kid]
It's wind...

Muttering that, I looked in the direction of
the wind.

Down the extremely long corridor.

Something appeared to be pushing and vying
for space.


78 :

{S1A082}
[Y¤u]
No way...


79 :

{S1A083}
[Y¤u]
You're kidding...


80 :

{S1A084}
[Y¤u]
It couldn't be...


81 :

{S1A085}
[Y¤u]
Water!?


82 :
A monster came crashing toward us at
a terrifying speed, mixed in a roiled
spray of water...


83 :
There was no doubt!

It was a rushing behemoth of water...

A massive froth of waves!

[Kid]
Ah!

It was not the time to be shouting.

Y¤u and I started sprinting desperately.


84 :
We turned left at the corner and ran.

And ran and ran.

The voice of the monster was right
on our heels.

But we couldn't look back.

If we looked back, we felt like
we would be swallowed up.

Something beyond fear or terror had made
our minds go completely blank.

We couldn't even think.

We could only run desperately for our lives.

My shoulder bumped against the wall of
the narrow corridor.

It looked like my foot would get caught up
in the bent metal flooring.

Avoiding the pipes that hung down, we leaped
over the raised entrance of the watertight
door and ran.

We just ran on and on.

(This has got to be a dream...)

For an instant, that thought cut across my mind.


In a world devoid of people...

Among faded colors...

A drooling monster was reaching its
bluish-white arms out toward my neck.


85 :
We were spit out with the mass of water into a
sprawling room.

We were turned head over heel in the
violent water.

Several times, maybe several dozen times,
over and over again...

Until, finally, my body stopped moving.

[Kid]
Ouch... Owwwwooouch...

I peeled my body from the soaked floor.

Water was still pouring in from the far
side of the open emergency entrance.

It was flowing down like a waterfall and
spreading smoothly toward the far corridor as
if it was crawling across the floor.

(That's right! What about Y¤u!?)


86 :
Just as I thought that and looked back, Y¤u
was standing up.

[Kid]
You okay?

I shook the soaked Y¤u's shoulders and
looked into her eyes.

They were empty...

Her purplish-blue lips were quivering.

Y¤u was completely dazed.

[Kid]
Y¤u! Y¤u! Hang on!

[Y¤u]
.........

The level of water had continued to rise
during that short time.

[Kid]
Ah! What should I do? What should I...

‡LJust then!


87 :
The watertight doors at the four sides of
the room began to close at once.

(The doors are closing...)

Ever so slowly, letting off a dull sound...

[Kid]
Y¤u! Y¤u!

I tried shouting and shaking her harder,
but there was no response.


88 :
Instead, Y¤u's body went limp, and she collapsed
to the floor.

[Kid]
Hey! Quit goofing around! Come on!

I took Y¤u's arm and put it over my shoulder,
lifting her up.

I started walking toward the nearest
watertight door.

Y¤u was heavy like a stone.

Water pooled around both my legs, so
I couldn't move forward as fast as I wanted.


89 :
A steel partition gradually slid
down from above.

Another one came up from below, pushing
away water as it moved.

The obstructed water swirled around.

As the width between the doors narrowed,
the water level increased.

(Come on! Make it in time! Please just make in
time...!)


90 :
Sadly, the door didn't stop moving.

There was only a small opening left for us
to escape.

[Kid]
Whoooaaaaa!

[Kid]
There's no way I'm going to die here!

Giving a shout, I ran, pushing the water out
of the way.

Y¤u's slumping body weighed heavily on
my shoulder.

But I couldn't let go of her arm.

I pulled together all my power.

(Almost there...!)


91 :
(Almost... Right there...!)

‡LThwump!

With one hand, I had grabbed hold of the
edge of the bulkhead.


92 :
Just barely.

Just a few seconds after I had squeezed our
bodies through that narrow gap, the watertight
door closed completely.

We placed our backs against the closed door
and collapsed.

There was almost no sense of relief.

Both of my legs were shaking, and my heart was
beating like it would explode.

We spent a few moments there in a stupor.


93 :
The next thing I knew, the seawater had mostly
disappeared from the floor.

That wasn't to say that it was completely dry.
It was still wet.

And my body and Y¤u's body...


{S1A086}
[Y¤u]
Ah.. ah... achhhooo!

...We were still soaked.

[Kid]
Are you alright?


94 :

{S1A087}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What?

[Kid]
"You were really out of it until just 
a second ago..."


95 :

{S1A088}
[Y¤u]
Who was?

[Kid]
You were.


{S1A089}
[Y¤u]
Me? I was?

Y¤u stood up and took her wet hair in hand.

Wiping away the water droplets around her eyes
with the palm of her hand...


96 :

{S1A090}
[Y¤u]
Oh! That's right!


97 :

{S1A091}
[Y¤u]
The water carried us away!


{S1A092}
[Y¤u]
Carried! And carried! And carried us away!


98 :

{S1A093}
[Y¤u]
...And... and what happened?

[Kid]
We got swept into the next corridor over.

[Kid]
"And then all of a sudden, the watertight doors 
started to close..."

[Kid]
But Y¤u, you were all spacey...

[Kid]
And to make things worse, you fainted...


99 :

{S1A094}
[Y¤u]
So how did we get out?

[Kid]
I got us out!


100 :

{S1A095}
[Y¤u]
You?

[Kid]
Yeah...


{S1A096}
[Y¤u]
Really?

[Kid]
What? You don't believe me?


{S1A097}
[Y¤u]
But...


101 :

{S1A098}
[Y¤u]
"You... Well, you seem more like the type who 
needs help rather than dishes help out."

[Kid]
What? What's that supposed to mean?


102 :

{S1A099}
[Y¤u]
Oh, it's a joke. I'm just kidding...


{S1A100}
[Y¤u]
"If you really did save us, I suppose 
I should thank you."


{S1A101}
[Y¤u]
Thank you.

Y¤u bowed her head slightly.

[Kid]
Do you really mean it?


103 :

{S1A102}
[Y¤u]
Of course... I guess.

[Kid]
You guess?


{S1A103}
[Y¤u]
I said I was joking.


104 :

{S1A104}
[Y¤u]
"You take everything so seriously... 
You're just an innocent young'un!"

[Kid]
.........


105 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Oh, whatever...

[Kid]
Well, I suppose I owed you one anyway...


106 :

{S1A105}
[Y¤u]
Owed me?

[Kid]
"When I collapsed at the shop, you helped me, 
right?"

[Kid]
So now we're even...


107 :
When I said that, Y¤u's face lit up in a smile.


[Kid]
"Anyway, enough of that. Let's hurry up and 
find an exit!"


108 :

{S1A106}
[Y¤u]
Yeah...


{S1A107}
[Y¤u]
"You never know when there might be more 
flooding..."


109 :
Y¤u was checking the ceiling and walls as she
started walking.

I followed along behind her.


110 :
We cut across the wide room, heading for the
exit.

There was a big, empty, mechanical
merry-go-round.

Without music or the voices of
children playing...

Only its bright lights glowed in a lonely
sort of way.


111 :

{S1A108}
[Y¤u]
Hey.


{S1A109}
[Y¤u]
"That reminds me. I haven't even asked 
your name yet."

[Kid]
...Huh?


{S1A110}
[Y¤u]
Name. Your name.

[Kid]
Oh... Yeah... That...

[Kid]
Um... I'm...

[Kid]
...My... name is...

[Kid]
...Name... is...

[Kid]
...


112 :

{S1A111}
[Y¤u]
And?


113 :
I... I didn't know.

I didn't know... my name...

My name...

There was no way! It couldn't be!

(I should know it.)

It's my name! My very own name!

Name... name... name... name...

‡LThen, all of a sudden, a shock shot
through my whole body.


114 :
[Kid]
Oooh... arggh...


{S1A112}
[Y¤u]
What's the matter?

My head hurt...

It seemed like it would split right open...

I held my head in both arms and crumpled
forward.


{S1A113}
[Y¤u]
Are you alright?

Grinding my teeth, I desperately tried to
endure the pain.

Darkness blanketed my eyes...

I couldn't see anything. I couldn't hear
anything.

The darkness invaded my brain and glommed
together.

It was a glob that would devour my brain...

And dissolve it... into... mush...


{S1A114}
[Y¤u]
Hey! Hang in there! Hey!

I didn't know...

I didn't know... my name...

Who could I...


115 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}


{16:0x}possibly be...?{16:1}

{16:4}

116 :
The next thing I knew, I was on a bed.

The ceiling was so white that it was slightly
blinding...

It smelled of disinfectant...


117 :

{S1A115}
[Y¤u]
Are you awake now?

A shadow passed above me on the bed.


[Kid]
Y¤u...

Y¤u looked at me as if she was worried.

[Kid]
This is...


118 :

{S1A116}
[Y¤u]
Back to the beginning... thanks to you.

[Kid]
The beginning...?

[Kid]
The infirmary, huh...


119 :

{S1A117}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, next time you decide to go and keel 
over, can you do it somewhere a little 
closer to this room?"


{S1A118}
[Y¤u]
"Because it was really a pain hauling you 
piggyback all the way here..."

[Kid]
S-sorry...


120 :

{S1A119}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, it's alright. You don't have to 
apologize..."


121 :

{S1A120}
[Y¤u]
By the way...


{S1A121}
[Y¤u]
Did you remember? Your name.

Name...


122 :
That's right... my name...


123 :

{S1A122}
[Y¤u]
Oh! Hold on a sec!


124 :

{S1A123}
[Y¤u]
"You don't have to try to force yourself to 
remember!"

[Kid]
...


{S1A124}
[Y¤u]
"I don't want you getting like you did 
before... Alright?"

Y¤u said it very carefully.


125 :

{S1A125}
[Y¤u]
I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions...


{S1A126}
[Y¤u]
"So just calm down... I want you to relax and 
answer them."


126 :

{S1A127}
[Y¤u]
Alright?

[Kid]
S-sure...


127 :

{S1A128}
[Y¤u]
First, do you know... today's date?

[Kid]
Today is...

[Kid]
...The 1st...

[Kid]
May 1st, right?


128 :

{S1A129}
[Y¤u]
You remember the date...


129 :

{S1A130}
[Y¤u]
So how about your age?

[Kid]
Age...?


{S1A131}
[Y¤u]
Your birthday will do... Either way.

I tried hard to pull together the threads of my
memory.

My age... My birthday...

When I started to think about it, my temples
began to throb.


130 :

{S1A132}
[Y¤u]
Hey, no straining yourself!


{S1A133}
[Y¤u]
"If you can't remember, then you can't 
remember. Just say so."

But that didn't mean I could just stop
thinking about it.

I endured the headache as I felt like
I wandered lost through a forest.

There had to be an exit hidden somewhere.

I just didn't know where...


131 :

{S1A134}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I got it.


{S1A135}
[Y¤u]
"So you don't remember your name, age, or 
birthday, right?"


132 :

{S1A136}
[Y¤u]
How about your address or telephone number?


{S1A137}
[Y¤u]
"If not those, then how about your family, 
friends... or anything...?"

[Kid]
...


133 :

{S1A138}
[Y¤u]
So you really can't remember?


134 :
It was just like Y¤u said.

I didn't have any memories of anything.

A sense of something not being right gnawed
at my mind.

No, it was something closer to a sense of loss.


I felt that I had lost the bulk of my existence.


Like someone had stolen 'me' away. And the 'me'
who was left was just an empty shell.

The 'me' that was there... Who knew if it was
even the real me?

The instant that thought went through my mind,
I was frozen by an icy wave of unease.

Scared, isolated, lonely,...


135 :
[Kid]
Y¤u...

I grabbed firmly onto Y¤u's hand.


136 :
Her warm palm...

That warmth was the only thing saving me.


{S1A139}
[Y¤u]
It's alright now.


{S1A140}
[Y¤u]
What are you, a baby? Stop with that sad face.

She shot me a smile as she squeezed my
hand back.


{S1A141}
[Y¤u]
"I don't think amnesia is all that 
uncommon."

[Kid]
Amnesia...?


137 :

{S1A142}
[Y¤u]
"You don't have any memory, so that's memory 
loss, or amnesia, right? Of course it is."


{S1A143}
[Y¤u]
I wonder what caused it...


{S1A144}
[Y¤u]
"The air pressure change... or maybe you hit 
your head somewhere..."


{S1A145}
[Y¤u]
Or maybe some severe mental shock.


138 :

{S1A146}
[Y¤u]
"Like maybe you were riding a crazy ride and you 
panicked, or something."

[Kid]
...


139 :

{S1A147}
[Y¤u]
But don't worry.


{S1A148}
[Y¤u]
"It's probably just temporary. It'll
come back."

[Kid]
Think so?


140 :

{S1A149}
[Y¤u]
For sure!


{S1A150}
[Y¤u]
"Of course, if you were in a major accident 
and had severe trauma to the brain, that 
would be a whole different thing."


{S1A151}
[Y¤u]
But that doesn't seem to be the case...

Y¤u put her hand on my hair and gave me a
smile so bright I almost needed sunglasses.

That smile flooded into my heart, wiping away
the remains of the unease that was swirling
there.


141 :

{S1A152}
[Y¤u]
So, do you want to get going?


{S1A153}
[Y¤u]
"I could sing you a lullaby and tuck you in, 
but..."


{S1A154}
[Y¤u]
Unfortunately, we don't have time to relax.


{S1A155}
[Y¤u]
You understand, right?

I nodded and got off of the bed.


142 :
Y¤u started walking for the door.

My eyes stopped on the bluish ribbon on
Y¤u's back.

The ribbon seemed to have taken on water and
glittered brightly, almost like the wings of
a newborn fairy.


143 :

{S1A156}
[Y¤u]
It's no good... It doesn't seem to open...

Y¤u said that after trying to move the door
with her weight several times.

Those were the emergency stairs.

Or more accurately, it was the passage on the
way there.

The emergency stairs were wound in a spiral
around a fat pipe.

If we followed those stairs, they would take
us to the floating island... At least in theory.

But then, right in front of us stood a thick
steel wall.

The wall had a small watertight door, and if we
couldn't squeeze through that, then we
couldn't make our way any higher.

[Kid]
"This isn't... the floating island yet, 
is it...?"


144 :

{S1A157}
[Y¤u]
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?


{S1A158}
[Y¤u]
"Not even. I mean, we haven't even hit Erster 
Boden, so we've still got a long way to go..."

[Kid]
Erster Boden... Was that the first basement floor?


145 :
Y¤u nodded...

[Kid]
"What does that mean in terms of depth? 
How deep is it?"


{S1A159}
[Y¤u]
"Let's see... Zweiter Stock is 34 meters deep, 
so..."


{S1A160}
[Y¤u]
Around 30 meters, give or take, I guess...


{S1A161}
[Y¤u]
"We've only climbed around four or five meters on 
these stairs."

30 meters deep...

30 meters sounded so close, but...


But in any event, if the door
didn't open up, then that was it.

[Kid]
Hey. I wonder why it won't open.


146 :

{S1A162}
[Y¤u]
Who knows...


{S1A163}
[Y¤u]
Maybe there's a secret spell or something.

[Kid]
"Spell... You mean like 'open sesame'? 
That kinda spell?"


147 :

{S1A164}
[Y¤u]
There you go, taking me seriously...

[Kid]
Well, what then?


148 :

{S1A165}
[Y¤u]
You really wanna know?

[Kid]
Yeah...


149 :

{S1A166}
[Y¤u]
Maybe you'd better not ask.

[Kid]
...Huh?


{S1A167}
[Y¤u]
"So what're you gonna do? 
Do you wanna hear it? Or not? Which is it?"

150 :
{11:0-2e}
{11:1}Ask

{11:1}Don't ask


151 :
[Kid]
I want to know.


152 :

{S1A168}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll tell you.

[Kid]
...


153 :
[Kid]
I don't want to know.


{S1A169}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


154 :

{S1A170}
[Y¤u]
Why not? Ask away!

[Kid]
But you said that I'd better not ask, right?


155 :

{S1A171}
[Y¤u]
You are so naïve.

[Kid]
What's wrong with being naïve?


156 :

{S1A172}
[Y¤u]
"Nothing's wrong with it... but you miss 
out... somehow."

[Kid]
.........


157 :

{S1A173}
[Y¤u]
Whatever. Anyway, I'll tell ya.

[Kid]
I said I don't want to hear.


158 :

{S1A174}
[Y¤u]
Be quiet! Shut up and listen already!

[Kid]
.........


159 :

{S1A175}
[Y¤u]
"You just were talking about how the 
watertight doors started closing 
all of a sudden, right?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


{S1A176}
[Y¤u]
"That means that the doors closed 
automatically..."

[Kid]
Closed automatically?


{S1A177}
[Y¤u]
"LeMMIH detected flooding and automatically 
shut the doors in the areas that were in 
danger."

[Kid]
Uh... What's 'LeMMIH'?


{S1A178}
[Y¤u]
"That's what we call the main computer that 
supervises and manages all of the electronic 
systems in LeMU."

[Kid]
Hmmmm.

[Kid]
...So what?


160 :

{S1A179}
[Y¤u]
So what? Here, I'll show you.


161 :
Clang, clang. Y¤u knocked on the steel door
with her lightly closed fist.


162 :

{S1A180}
[Y¤u]
"This... was probably closed by 'LeMMIH' 
as well."

[Kid]
I see...

[Kid]
"So, in other words, the other side of 
this door is flooded with water."


163 :

{S1A181}
[Y¤u]
Probably.

She had been right. It really wasn't something
I had wanted to hear.

If the doors were simply locked, all we had to
do was find a way to open it and we could
climb up to freedom.

But if the other side was full of seawater,
then...

Thinking beyond that was no fun.

[Kid]
So what do we do now?


164 :

{S1A182}
[Y¤u]
"I guess we should check out the other
emergency stairs..."


165 :

{S1A183}
[Y¤u]
That's all we can do, right?

Y¤u said that with a sigh and started heading
down the stairs.
