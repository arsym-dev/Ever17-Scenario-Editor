1 :
I turned the knob, and the door to the
elevator opened slowly.


{T1A000}
[Announcement]
<System-Wiederaufnahme.>

I heard the mechanical announcement but
didn't understand what it meant.

[Takeshi]
The battery is probably dead...

I pushed the button, but my PDA didn't respond.

Thanks to the help of the backlight of my
display, I had found the door's emergency manual
opening mechanism.

[Takeshi]
Hey, are you alive?

I spoke to the girl.


2 :

{T1A001}
[Girl]
...Yes.

She looked a little tired.

The floor was silent.

I heard the sound of water flowing somewhere.

It was a muffled sound....

But there was no sign of anyone around.

[Takeshi]
What's going on here?


3 :

{T1A002}
[Girl]
I don't... know...

[Takeshi]
Let's go see if we can find anyone else.


4 :
We went into the corridor.

Most of the doors were locked as if to keep us
from intruding.

We found a floor directory, so we decided to
look around the rooms listed on it.


5 :
We came out to an open space.

It was called the 'rest area'.

There was a scattered mess of bags, a pair of shoes,
wrapping paper from the souvenir shop, and other stuff
discarded on the floor.

As I had expected, there was no one there.

There was a thick set of shutters in the
circular space in the center of the area.

[Takeshi]
...Ahahaha.

I laughed an empty laugh.

[Takeshi]
I wonder if this area is under construction.

[Takeshi]
"That's probably why nobody's here. Yeah, 
I'll bet that's why."


6 :
[Girl]
.........

[Takeshi]
Let's try the next place.


7 :
We continued down the path we had been walking.

The door down the corridor was shut firmly.

[Takeshi]
Doesn't this door open?


8 :

{T1A003}
[Girl]
I don't think it will. I don't see a switch.

We chose a corridor which was open and slowly
walked down it.

We didn't come across anyone.

It felt like we were walking a route that
someone had set up for us....


9 :
A door on the side of the corridor had been
left open, and we went in.

There was a stand selling tuna sandwiches.

It smelled like they had been cooking until
recently.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, buddy, I'll take two of the sandwiches 
that are half price on weekdays."

[Takeshi]
...If only someone were here...

[Takeshi]
"Looks like he ran off and left his stand. 
Doesn't he have any pride?"

[Takeshi]
Huh? There aren't any other customers here!

[Takeshi]
Business isn't exactly booming, is it?


10 :
[Girl]
.........

[Takeshi]
I'm hungry...

[Takeshi]
I wasted too much energy walking around...

[Takeshi]
"And my friends took off somewhere without 
telling me..."

[Takeshi]
Don't you think that's rude?


11 :

{T1A004}
[Girl]
...Not really.


{T1A005}
[Girl]
"We just met, and I don't particularly care 
about you."

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.


12 :
We returned to the corridor we'd come from,
turned at an intersection, and looked for
other rooms.


13 :
Everywhere looked the same.

[Takeshi]
I wonder if everyone is hiding somewhere.

[Takeshi]
Maybe they're trying to surprise us.


14 :

{T1A006}
[Girl]
What? Why do you think so?

[Takeshi]
Well, it's just kind of a feeling...

I had to speak to stay calm.

I felt like if I went quiet, I would return
to the darkness of before.


15 :
In the room we went in next, ruins were
awaiting us.

'Lemurian Ruins'...

They were filled with silence.

If it wasn't for the paper garbage strewn
across the floor, it would have been hard to
believe that anyone had been around.

[Takeshi]
Where is everybody...?

[Takeshi]
Hey!

[Takeshi]
Gimme a break here!

[Takeshi]
Where did everybody go?

[Takeshi]
"...There's a limit to how far you can take a 
joke..."


16 :
[Girl]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


17 :
[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...

[Takeshi]
Why doesn't anyone come out...?

I sank to the floor.

I didn't know why, but I was having trouble
breathing.

Against my will, I started to sweat.

[Takeshi]
"What do you think? What happened here? Why 
haven't we seen anyone?"


18 :

{T1A007}
[Girl]
"I don't know... There's only one thing for 
sure."

She said that without changing the expression
on her face.


{T1A008}
[Girl]
This is not normal.


{T1A009}
[Girl]
If this keeps up...


{T1A010}
[Girl]
We could be in danger.


19 :

{T1A011}
[Girl]
Don't you think so?

[Takeshi]
.........

She stared at me with calm eyes.


20 :
I thought I heard a low groan from somewhere.

I swallowed nervously...

I nodded uncomfortably...


21 :
The next instant, the girl dashed to the
other side of the corridor.


22 :
I quickly stood up and followed her.

I was exhausted, but I used every bit of my
power to push ahead.

We jumped into a small entrance on the side
of the corridor.


23 :
We headed up.

We started climbing up stairs at top speed.


24 :
We ignored our pounding hearts. We simply ran.


25 :
We ran without looking back.


26 :
We ran...


27 :
We reached the top floor and I put my hand on
the emergency hatch connected to the floating
island.

The knob didn't budge.

[Takeshi]
Damn, why won't it open!?


28 :
Gabaaaang!

The whole structure rocked.


29 :
The hatch gave off a squeaking sound and the
knob bent unnaturally.

[Takeshi]
!?


{T1A012}
[Girl]
This way!

The girl screamed.


30 :
We rushed back to the stairs again.

We had no time to go down each step.

We jumped down toward the direction where we
could see the corridor.


31 :
The impact with the ground rattled my knees
terribly, but I ignored the pain.


32 :
[Takeshi]
*Pant*, *pant*...

[Takeshi]
Phew... *pant*... *pant*...

I was out of breath. I gasped.

[Takeshi]
Haaaa... haaaa... haaaaa.

[Takeshi]
Fwaaaa... huuuu... haaaaa.

[Takeshi]
Hiihii... huuuu... haaaaa.

[Takeshi]
...Safe place, pokopon.


33 :

{T1A013}
[Girl]
...?

The girl's expression didn't change.

(Anyway, she hasn't lost her breath much
after running that hard...)


34 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, don't you want to rest?

[Takeshi]
I want to rest...


35 :

{T1A014}
[Girl]
Go ahead. Do what you want...

[Takeshi]
...Fine then.


36 :
I sat down on the floor.

The girl walked slowly ahead down the corridor.

We could see hundreds of colorful fish
swimming comfortably outside the windows.

The room was quiet too.

It was just the two of us. Me and her.

Then I remembered that I still didn't know
who she was.

She had told me to 'do what I want', but...

Until then, we'd been trying to escape together.

I wondered what she was all about.

It was all... a mystery to me.


37 :

{T1A015}
[Girl]
...Who?

Her voice caused me to look up.

She hadn't said it to me.

[Takeshi]
Hey, was somebody there?

I asked this as I stood.


38 :
[Girl]
...

The girl stood still. Her eyes were focused
in the distance.

I followed her gaze.


39 :
A lady had appeared where there had been no
sign of anyone a moment before, and she was
dressed as a park employee.

I hadn't heard any footsteps.

(Huh?)

(When did she get here?)


{T1A016}
[Park staff]
...From here.


{T1A017}
[Park staff]
This area is not safe. Please escape.


{T1A018}
[Park staff]
Please. Please, you must escape from here.


{T1A019}
[Park staff]
It is dangerous, it is dangerous...

She looked slightly panicked.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, hey. What's happened? What's dangerous? 
Stay calm. Explain what's going on..."


{T1A020}
[Park staff]
"You need to escape... We have had... 
unexpected... trouble."


{T1A021}
[Park staff]
Level... Delta... Tief... Blau.

She mumbled this again.


{T1A022}
[Park staff]
Please escape. Please.


40 :

{T1A023}
[Park staff]
Please get out of here!


41 :
Crash!


42 :
Fwaaaaaash!

[Takeshi]
UuuuwwWWAAaaaahh!!

Glass shattered.

A massive amount of seawater...

And countless fish came flooding in.


43 :
It was as if they were attacking me!


44 :

{T1A024}
[Girl]
What're you doing? Hurry!

[Takeshi]
W-whoaaa!


45 :
The destructive force of the water was
incredible.

The approaching swell mowed down everything
in its path.

It swirled and swallowed debris on the floor,
someone's dropped purse, a floor guide for the
facility... anything and everything it
encountered.

(I wonder how fast that water is moving...)

Ridiculous thoughts flashed through my mind.

(And... I wonder how fast I can run.)

There was no guarantee the water wouldn't
catch me.


46 :
[Takeshi]
Whoa! Whoaaa! Whoaaaaaa!

I ran frantically.

And jumped in the air.

There was water flowing underfoot.


47 :
[Takeshi]
Whoooooa....


48 :
I slipped.

I knew the situation was bad.

If I took a spill, I would be sleeping with
those fish!


{T1A025}
[Girl]
You're so much trouble...!


49 :
I was carried along into the air.

The girl had grabbed my arm and yanked me
forward with incredible force.

She ran lithely, like a tiny gazelle....

And her speed was like I had just hopped
into a car.

It almost felt as though she might rip my arm
off.

Her strength was unbelievable.


50 :

{T1A026}
[Park staff]
Over here! Hurry! Hurry!


{T1A027}
[Girl]
I know!

[Takeshi]
!?

And even harder to believe was that the park
attendant was running ahead of us, leading
the way.

(When did she...?)

It looked like she had just been sucked into
the swirling waters ahead, but... no...


51 :

{T1A028}
[Girl]
Damn...


{T1A029}
[Park staff]
"This is no good! It's not functioning! Go 
back!"


52 :

{T1A030}
[Girl]
There's no time!


53 :
We bounded from the slope into another
corridor.

[Takeshi]
Crap. Which way do we take to get outta here?

We all ran without stopping, looking for an
exit.


54 :
[Takeshi]
It's a dead end...!


55 :

{T1A031}
[Girl]
Can we go through here?


{T1A032}
[Park staff]
Yes!


56 :

{T1A033}
[Girl]
I'm going!


57 :
[Takeshi]
Hey... this isn't a corridor... aggh!


58 :
She kicked through some metal mesh and into a
big air exhaust duct.

It was a sloping pipe-like tube.

We shot down the incline, stumbling.

It sounded like there was a crazed froth of
angry water roaring behind me.

No, I was already caught up in it.

Everyone was just flushed along.

We were spun in circles. I had no idea which
way was up and which was down.

And then we were all spit out in a corridor
on the lower level.


59 :
Saved by a hair, the shutter on the duct
clanked shut solidly behind us.

The flow of water finally stopped.


60 :
...

Aaah...

It was solid ground.

It was a floor.

I was safe.

I wasn't in the water.

I was alive.

That was good...

...

(Good?)
