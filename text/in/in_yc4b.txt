1 :
[Kid]
Rip Van Winkle DID exist!

I screamed out.


2 :

{C4A426}
[Y¤u]
You're so silly.


{C4A427}
[Y¤u]
It's just a fairy tale!

[Kid]
Look, not all fairy tales are fiction!


{C4A428}
[Y¤u]
"That doesn't mean that Rip Van Winkle 
actually existed, does it?"


{C4A429}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, even if the tale of Rip Van Winkle 
was real, that has nothing to do with you, 
Kid."

[Kid]
It does too.

[Kid]
"We're talking about whether people could 
actually travel through time, right?"


3 :

{C4A430}
[Y¤u]
That's what I mean! Don't you get it!?


{C4A431}
[Y¤u]
"I'm saying that even if someone could actually 
travel through time, that doesn't necessarily mean 
that you did."

[Kid]
Then how come I can see the future?


4 :

{C4A432}
[Y¤u]
Don't ask me. How should I know...?

[Kid]
"It has to be because I'm experiencing the 
same moments in time over and over again."

[Kid]
"I must have been stuck in LeMU in the past 
also..."

[Kid]
"Three days passed, and then four, five 
days... and after that, I must have slipped 
through time for some reason."

[Kid]
"Meaning I must have traveled back in time 
to the moment I fell into that pond."

[Kid]
That must be why I can look into the future.

[Kid]
"No, I mean, I must be remembering things I've 
already experienced in the past instead of 
looking into the future, to be exact."

[Kid]
"I don't know how, but I'm probably carrying 
memories of the past."


5 :

{C4A433}
[Y¤u]
Really... Well, that must be it then.

[Kid]
Oh, c'mon, I'm being serious here!


6 :

{C4A434}
[Y¤u]
"I'm sorry... but I've got far more serious, 
urgent problems."


{C4A435}
[Y¤u]
I've got tons of things to think about.


{C4A436}
[Y¤u]
You know what I'm talking about, Kid?

[Kid]
.........


{C4A437}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know what the reason is, but you can 
predict the future."


{C4A438}
[Y¤u]
So what...?


{C4A439}
[Y¤u]
"It's not like it's a bad ability to have. As 
a matter of fact, I can imagine that it would 
really come in handy."

[Kid]
"You make it sound so simple... but in my 
case, I don't think it's the ability to see 
the future. I'm pretty sure I traveled 
through time."

[Kid]
"I might even be repeating the same moments in 
history over and over again."

[Kid]
"And what's more, I'm pretty sure the amnesia 
has something to do with the time travel..."


7 :

{C4A440}
[Y¤u]
Look, how many times do I have to tell you?


{C4A441}
[Y¤u]
Time travel is NOT possible.


{C4A442}
[Y¤u]
"And as far as your amnesia, I'm sure you'll 
regain your memories in time!"


{C4A443}
[Y¤u]
"You're already beginning to remember things, 
right?"


{C4A444}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, you've actually remembered most 
everything, haven't you?"

[Kid]
Not everything.

[Kid]
I just remembered things about Sara.

[Kid]
Just childhood memories.

[Kid]
"I still don't have any memories from the 
last few years..."

[Kid]
"I have no idea how I got to LeMU, why, or with 
whom."

[Kid]
"I still don't remember anything before May 
1st, the day I came to LeMU."

[Kid]
Where I was... what I was doing...

[Kid]
Or who I am...


8 :

{C4A445}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


{C4A446}
[Y¤u]
Wa-wa-wait a second.


9 :

{C4A447}
[Y¤u]
"You're Mayo's brother, right? You did 
remember that, don't you?"

[Kid]
Uh, yeah.


{C4A448}
[Y¤u]
So you have to at least know 'who you are'.

[Kid]
But... I don't...


{C4A449}
[Y¤u]
...?

[Kid]
How can I explain this...?

[Kid]
"If someone were to ask me, 'Who are you?', all 
I could say is, 'I'm Matsunaga Sara's 
brother.'"

[Kid]
I don't know any other way to answer.

Then, all of a sudden, Y¤u...


10 :

{C4A450}
[Y¤u]
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!

Y¤u raised her voice and pointed her finger
at me.


{C4A451}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, that reminds me, I keep forgetting to 
ask you something important!"

[Kid]
Something important?


11 :

{C4A452}
[Y¤u]
Name! Your name!


{C4A453}
[Y¤u]
Your name, Kid!

[Kid]
.........


{C4A454}
[Y¤u]
Mayo told you, didn't she?

[Kid]
.........


12 :

{C4A455}
[Y¤u]
You DID ask her, didn't you?

[Kid]
.........


13 :

{C4A456}
[Y¤u]
You haven't asked her your name!?

[Kid]
Um... No... I haven't.


14 :
Y¤u shook her head, looked up at the ceiling,
and chewed on her lips.


15 :
She clenched her fist, went to shake it into
the air, then rethought it and pulled it back
down.

Y¤u then proceeded to stomp around in a puddle
of water.

She crouched down and hopped up swiftly.

She took a deep breath.

I thought she was going to exhale, but
she continued to take one long breath in.

And then she said...


16 :

{C4A457}
[Y¤u]
ARE YOU STUPID OR WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!?


17 :
Her voice was so loud that it shook LeMU like an
earthquake.

I was a bit frightened that it would tear the
partition walls.

{C4A458}
[Y¤u]
"That's the first thing you should ask her 
before anything else!"

[Kid]
"Well... you probably wouldn't understand this, 
but..."

[Kid]
Sara and I had so much else to talk about.

[Kid]
"We had endless things to talk about... and I 
just didn't have the presence of mind or 
chance to think about myself."

[Kid]
"For us, the first priority was to regain the 
time we had lost."

[Kid]
"And to be honest, I couldn't care less about my 
name."


18 :

{C4A459}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kid... Just think about it.


{C4A460}
[Y¤u]
"It's your own name. Aren't you curious to 
know?"

[Kid]
"Now that you've brought it up, I'm starting 
to wonder..."

[Kid]
"When I was talking to Sara, it didn't even 
pass through my mind."


19 :

{C4A461}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*...

Y¤u sighed with an exaggerated gesture.

[Kid]
Well, just put yourself in our position, Y¤u.

[Kid]
"Sara and I saw each other for the first time 
in nine years."

[Kid]
"We were just so happy, caught up in the 
memories..."

[Kid]
"But on the other hand, we were scared, in 
pain, and our hearts ached..."

[Kid]
"All these emotions were mixed up and jumbled 
together and came flooding over us."

[Kid]
"Sara and I were overwhelmed just trying to 
understand one another."

[Kid]
"Like I said, names didn't seem so important 
at that time."

[Kid]
"She just called me 'onii-chan', and I just 
wanted to call her Sara."

[Kid]
Do you understand?


20 :

{C4A462}
[Y¤u]
No, not at all.


21 :
Y¤u said that and started to walk off.

[Kid]
Hey, wait a second! Where are you going!?


22 :
Splashing water, Y¤u walked down the long
straight corridor...

I tagged along beside her and asked her again.

[Kid]
Hey, where are you going?


23 :

{C4A463}
[Y¤u]
I'm going to ask Mayo.

[Kid]
What?


24 :

{C4A464}
[Y¤u]
Well, helloooo? Your name, of course, Kid!

[Kid]
Look, you don't have to do that...


25 :

{C4A465}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Why not?

[Kid]
.........


26 :

{C4A466}
[Y¤u]
What you've been saying doesn't make sense.


27 :

{C4A467}
[Y¤u]
"Don't you want to regain your full memory? 
Don't you want to know who you are?"

[Kid]
Oh, of course I do, but...


28 :

{C4A468}
[Y¤u]
"Well then, instead of talking about stupid, 
outrageous things like seeing the future or 
time travel..."


{C4A469}
[Y¤u]
"Don't you think it'd just be faster to ask 
Mayo?"

I thought back briefly to the sight of myself
in that mirror.

I had been so confused at that time because
'my face' didn't look like 'my face'.

If the same thing happened when Sara told me
my name...

I was afraid that I might feel like 'my name'
wasn't really 'my name' and end up all
confused again.

To tell the truth, it was a bit scary.

Besides...

[Kid]
Is a name really all that important?


29 :

{C4A470}
[Y¤u]
...What?

[Kid]
"Look, names are just things people give 
themselves to make identifying one another 
more convenient."

[Kid]
"It's just for convenience... So while living 
without a name certainly has its own 
challenges, I don't think a name is an 
absolute necessity."

[Kid]
"Take dolphins. They're highly intelligent 
creatures, but they don't go around calling 
one another by name."

[Kid]
And they seem to be getting along just fine.

[Kid]
"They seem to be able to identify one dolphin 
from the others too..."

[Kid]
"They know which one is a son, which one is a 
wife, and the difference between a gray whale 
and a killer whale..."

[Kid]
"They don't have names, yet they can recognize 
things correctly."

[Kid]
"And... this is just speculation, but... 
they seem to recognize individual identities."

[Kid]
"A dolphin seems to have its own sense of 
self, separate from that of the dolphin 
swimming next to it. And it's aware that it's 
a separate entity."

[Kid]
"They don't have to depend on names to 
recognize all these things..."

[Kid]
"My name is James, this one next to me is 
Ling Ling, and that one chasing after a fish 
is Yumemi..."

[Kid]
I don't think they do that.

[Kid]
"It may sound kind of cocky, but sometimes I 
feel humans depend on names too much."

[Kid]
"If, one day, this girl you've known as Ling 
Ling tells you, 'Oh, by the way, my name is 
Lang Lang', wouldn't that throw you off?"

[Kid]
It'd cause confusion... and you might think...

[Kid]
"'You know, Ling Ling and Lang Lang are really 
similar, but they're probably just two 
different people'..."

[Kid]
"It seems stupid to get confused just because 
of a name."

[Kid]
"Meaning people value, trust, and depend on 
names more than the actual individual 
differences..."

[Kid]
I bet dolphins don't think like that.

[Kid]
"Because, to begin with, they don't have 
names to identify individuals."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"I realized that for the first time once I 
lost my name."

[Kid]
"I noticed that a name really isn't all that 
important."


30 :
Y¤u didn't stop walking.

I couldn't tell whether she was listening to
me or not, because she didn't respond to me
at all.


31 :
[Kid]
Hey, are you listening to me?

As we turned around a corner, I asked her.


32 :

{C4A471}
[Y¤u]
Yup, I'm listening, I'm listening.


33 :

{C4A472}
[Y¤u]
"I've been thinking about what you were just 
saying..."

[Kid]
?


34 :

{C4A473}
[Y¤u]
I feel like I understand what you mean.


{C4A474}
[Y¤u]
"You know, I've had a complex about my name 
for a long time, and I've actually thought 
quite a lot about this issue."

[Kid]
Complex?


{C4A475}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.

[Kid]
Y¤u don't like your own name, Y¤u?


35 :

{C4A476}
[Y¤u]
Of course I don't.

[Kid]
Why?


36 :

{C4A477}
[Y¤u]
I'm embarrassed about it.


{C4A478}
[Y¤u]
"People introduce themselves to one another 
when they meet, right?"


{C4A479}
[Y¤u]
"Every time a new year at school would start, 
I would just cringe..."

[Kid]
Oh.


37 :
I murmured.

[Kid]
"I remember you said something about your 
full name being much longer, right?"


{C4A480}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.

[Kid]
"Well, would that have something to do with 
the fact that you don't like your name?"


38 :

{C4A481}
[Y¤u]
"Something to do with it...? That's WHY I 
don't like it."


39 :
Y¤u stopped walking.

She had a bitter smile on her face.


{C4A482}
[Y¤u]
Do you want to know?

[Kid]
What?


40 :

{C4A483}
[Y¤u]
I still haven't told you my full name yet.

[Kid]
Uh, I guess.


{C4A484}
[Y¤u]
Will you promise that you won't laugh?

[Kid]
...Sure.


{C4A485}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll tell you.


{C4A486}
[Y¤u]
My name is...


{C4A487}
[Y¤u]
Tanaka...


{C4A488}
[Y¤u]
Yubiseiakikana.


41 :
[Kid]
Huh...?


{C4A489}
[Y¤u]
"It means 'gentle beautiful pure autumn
fragrant green blossom'."

[Kid]
Huuuh!?

[Kid]
Yubisei'aki'kana!?


42 :
Suddenly, it was as if I felt a heavy
thud in the bottom of my heart.

A strange feeling started to take over my body.

A sense of something out of place...

That was it! That was right!

I must have known Y¤u's real name!

Wait... but... I'd never heard it from Y¤u
directly...

What was going on!?

It was just like the situation with Sara...

I already knew Y¤u's real name from before...


Y¤u's real name was...

[Kid]
Your... real... name is...

[Kid]
Yubisei'haru'kana.


43 :

{C4A490}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
You said it wrong, didn't you?

[Kid]
You actually meant to say 'harukana', right?


44 :

{C4A491}
[Y¤u]
"Look, I don't think I'd say my own name 
incorrectly."


{C4A492}
[Y¤u]
"Well, 'haru' or 'aki', either one is fine 
with me."


{C4A493}
[Y¤u]
"But on the birth certificate, it says 
'aki'..."

[Kid]
No!


45 :

{C4A494}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
Your full name has to be Yubisei'haru'kana!

[Kid]
It's not 'aki'!


46 :

{C4A495}
[Y¤u]
Hahahahaha...


47 :

{C4A496}
[Y¤u]
Ahahahaha~

[Kid]
"What are you laughing about!? This isn't 
funny at all!"

[Kid]
You don't remember your own name!


48 :

{C4A497}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, yeah, that just may be it.


{C4A498}
[Y¤u]
"My real name is... Oh, was it Ling Ling? No, 
wait, maybe it was Lang Lang?"

[Kid]
.........


{C4A499}
[Y¤u]
Kid, listen up.


{C4A500}
[Y¤u]
My name is Yubiseiakikana.


{C4A501}
[Y¤u]
"It's been that way since I was born, and it 
will be that way as long as I live."


{C4A502}
[Y¤u]
You got it?


{C4A503}
[Y¤u]
"It's neither haru, nor natsu, nor 
fuyu, but aki."


{C4A504}
[Y¤u]
Do you know why?

[Kid]
.........


{C4A505}
[Y¤u]
I was born eighteen years and seven months ago.


{C4A506}
[Y¤u]
A little more than seven months, to be exact.


{C4A507}
[Y¤u]
My birthday is September 22nd.


{C4A508}
[Y¤u]
I was born in Japan.


{C4A509}
[Y¤u]
I wasn't born in the southern hemisphere.


{C4A510}
[Y¤u]
Let's see... Is September spring in Japan?


{C4A511}
[Y¤u]
No, it's autumn, isn't it?


{C4A512}
[Y¤u]
So, my name is 'akikana', you got that?

I was already starting to lose my sense of
reality.

A bottomless fear crept up from the bottom of my
stomach and threatened to leap out of my
throat.

My head started to ache.

And then...


49 :

{C4A513}
[Sara]
Onii-chan! Nakkyu!

I glanced as I put my hand on my temple.


50 :
Splashing water in all directions, Sara came
toward us.


51 :

{C4A514}
[Y¤u]
Good timing...


{C4A515}
[Sara]
Good timing?

Sara stood in front of us, tilting her head
quizzically.


{C4A516}
[Y¤u]
Actually, I had a question for you, Mayo.


{C4A517}
[Sara]
What is it?


{C4A518}
[Y¤u]
The Kid's name.


{C4A519}
[Y¤u]
Will you tell me his real name?

Y¤u put her hand over my shoulder.

I knew her hand was touching my shoulder, but
I couldn't feel it.

I was dizzy and about to faint.

I thought to myself, 'This'll probably be a lot
easier if I just faint.'

But both my feet stood soundly on the floor,
and I braced myself.

I looked at Sara.

Sara's mouth opened up like an empty hollow.


52 :
[Sara]
   !

[Sara]
   ,   ?

I couldn't hear her voice.

I saw Sara's lips were moving, but I couldn't
hear her voice for some reason.

[Y¤u]
   ,   


53 :
[Y¤u]
   ,   ...

[Y¤u]
   ,   '   '   

I couldn't hear Y¤u's voice either.

All I could hear was just the sound of my
blood flowing through my ears...

In that moment, my sight crashed into pieces.

The scenery before me was stripped of all
color...

A voice... A voice...

A voice...

I could heard a voice from afar...

From faraway darkness...

Somebody whispering to me...


54 :
[Kid]
Who... are you?

[Kid]
Who... am I?

Who...

...am I?


55 :

{C4A520}
[Sara]
Hokuto!


{C4A521}
[Sara]
Your name is Hokuto!


{C4A522}
[Y¤u]
Hokuto, huh?


56 :

{C4A523}
[Y¤u]
So that's what he's called...


{C4A524}
[Y¤u]
"Now that you mention it, he does look kind 
of like a 'Hokuto' to me."

[Kid]
Hokuto...

[Kid]
That is...

[Kid]
...My...

[Kid]
...Name...?


57 :

{C4A525}
[Sara]
That's right, onii-chan~

[Kid]
Hokuto... Hokuto... Hokuto...

I repeated it aloud over and over again.

[Kid]
Hokuto... Hokuto... Hokuto...

My hunch had been right.

I had never heard the name 'Hokuto' before.

'Hokuto'‡LThat couldn't possibly be my name.


It didn't feel real to me at all.

But Sara wouldn't lie to me.

So I figured 'Hokuto' must be my name.

Hokuto... Hokuto... Hokuto...

Name... Name... Name...

Y¤u's name was Yubiseiakikana.

My name was Hokuto.

There was too much to think about.

I felt I was close to my mental limit.

I was dizzy.

My head ached.

I looked at my palm.

I had five fingers...

Everything seemed out of place to me.

I still couldn't regain the 'real' me.

(Is this me who's looking at my palm? Or is it
somebody that isn't me?)

(Is Hokuto really me? Or is it me who's not
Hokuto?)

[Kid]
Hokuto... Hokuto... Hokuto...

[Kid]
Is it really...?


58 :
[Takeshi]
Is that really his name?

Tsugumi slightly nodded her head.

Her face was all red.

[Takeshi]
So, he's Chami. Because he's charming.

[Takeshi]
That's cute. What a good name!

How... cute.

That was what I thought.

I did my best to stifle my laughter.


59 :

{C4A526}
[Tsugumi]
Hey! You promised not to laugh!

[Takeshi]
I'm not laughing!

I tried to keep a straight face... but the
corners of my mouth started to twitch.

I could just imagine Tsugumi baby-talking to
it‡L'Chami-chan, Chami-chan, it's din-din time~'


{C4A527}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaaaah...!


{C4A528}
[Tsugumi]
That's why I didn't want to tell you!

Sullen, Tsugumi was red-faced...

...But she held out the bath towel she had
behind her back.

[Takeshi]
Oh, thanks!

I took the towel and wiped myself down.

[Takeshi]
Phew...

I breathed deeply, feeling reborn, as I
glanced at Tsugumi's profile.


60 :
She was playing with the hamster in her hand,
and her cheeks were bright.

She looked so happy...

It was the first time I'd ever seen her smile
like she meant it.


{C4A529}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


{C4A530}
[Tsugumi]
Thank you.

Tsugumi said it in a whisper, without looking
at my face.


61 :
I headed toward the Ei area with Tsugumi.

Since we were in the area with the generator
room, we had to take one of the egg-like
elevators to get back.

I felt excited, maybe from the feeling of
accomplishment of rescuing Chami.

But... my feet were heavy. My body just
couldn't keep up.

I was exhausted.

Five hours earlier, I had been running with
Y¤u on my back since she'd started suffering
from something all of a sudden.

And with my effort to rescue Chami, I swam
over 102 meters underwater...

(Is this really just fatigue?)

(This heaviness...)

(I feel a bit feverish too.)

(I have a slight headache...)

(Maybe I caught a cold?)


62 :

{C4A531}
[Tsugumi]
What's wrong?

Tsugumi must have noticed my slow steps because
she looked worriedly at my face.

[Takeshi]
I'm just tired.


{C4A532}
[Tsugumi]
Are you alright?

[Takeshi]
Haha, yeah, I'm fine.

[Takeshi]
I'm just tired, that's all.


{C4A533}
[Tsugumi]
Okay.

Tsugumi was worried about me.

It was a funny feeling.

[Takeshi]
By the way, how about yourself?


63 :

{C4A534}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Your leg... You know, your injury.

Tsugumi was dragging her right foot.


64 :

{C4A535}
[Tsugumi]
I'm alright.

[Takeshi]
"Are you really? The wound didn't open up or 
anything, did it?"


{C4A536}
[Tsugumi]
Do you wanna see?

Tsugumi stopped walking.

She quickly flipped up her skirt with her
hands.

[Takeshi]
C-cut it out!

In shock, I slapped Tsugumi's hand and
stopped her.


65 :

{C4A537}
[Tsugumi]
Hahahaha...

Tsugumi chuckled gleefully.

My feet suddenly felt much lighter.


66 :
As for Y¤u...

It turned out she wasn't as bad as I thought.

After resting for about an hour in the
infirmary, Y¤u regained a surprising amount
of her strength.

'But why did you suddenly start suffering like that?'


I asked Y¤u, but she changed the subject and
didn't tell me anything.

I also asked Sora, but her answer was the same.

Sora must have known something since she had
examined Y¤u with the repaired L-MRI.

That thought still bothered me.


67 :
It was still the case that only one person at a
time could ride the egg.

Tsugumi went up first.

I rode up shortly after.

The egg zipped upward, quickly arriving at
Zweiter Stock.


68 :
As soon as I got there, Tsugumi was waiting
for me.

Chami was sitting on her hand.

Tsugumi stuck out both of her arms to the side.

Chami walked from one hand to the other,
crossing Tsugumi's arms.

Tsugumi had such a happy smile on her face...

That I couldn't help smiling too...

For no particular reason, Tsugumi and I
stared at each other for a while.


69 :

{C4A538}
[Tsugumi]
Do you want to try?

Asking that, Tsugumi put Chami on my shoulder.

I stretched out my arms...

And suddenly, Chami charged onto my arms.

It tickled so much that I couldn't help but
wriggle my body.


{C4A539}
[Tsugumi]
Hahaha~

Chami looked hesitant when he got to the end,
which was the tip of my hand.

I held Chami gently in my palm and looked at
him closely.

[Takeshi]
Chami, huh...?

[Takeshi]
"Are you Chami!? Well, are you!? C'mon, answer 
me!"

Of course, Chami didn't answer.

Maybe he was frightened I would eat him.


[Takeshi]
Yeah... he sure is charming.

[Takeshi]
He's Chami because he's so darn charming.

Curious, I decided to ask Tsugumi a question.


[Takeshi]
Why are you called Tsugumi?


70 :

{C4A540}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Your name, I mean.

[Takeshi]
"Does it come from Chinese character for the 
bird, the redwing?"


{C4A541}
[Tsugumi]
The bird?

[Takeshi]
If I remember correctly, they migrate, right?


71 :

{C4A542}
[Tsugumi]
Oh, redwings?


{C4A543}
[Tsugumi]
Unfortunately...


{C4A544}
[Tsugumi]
My name has nothing to do with birds.

[Takeshi]
Then what does your name mean?

As I asked Tsugumi, I passed Chami back into
her hand.

Tsugumi picked up Chami and told me.


{C4A545}
[Tsugumi]
"'Satellite of the earth' and 'where we are 
at'."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C4A546}
[Tsugumi]
What's the one satellite this earth has?

[Takeshi]
The moon?


{C4A547}
[Tsugumi]
And where are we right now?

[Takeshi]
LeMU.


{C4A548}
[Tsugumi]
What's all around us here at LeMU?

[Takeshi]
Uh... Around us... The ocean?


{C4A549}
[Tsugumi]
Yup.


{C4A550}
[Tsugumi]
"In Japanese, you write it 'moon' and then 
'ocean', and read it 'Tsugumi'."

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.

[Takeshi]
"Come to think of it, I didn't know which 
Chinese characters your name used."

[Takeshi]
'Moon' and 'ocean', huh...?

[Takeshi]
Hmm, that's a really pretty name.


72 :
Tsugumi's cheeks turned pink.

And then...


73 :

{C4A551}
[£o¢o]
Daddy! Mommy!


{PIPI_10}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*! *Bow-wow*!

£o¢o and Pipi came rushing in.


74 :
[Takeshi]
I told you NOT to call me daddy!


{C4A552}
[Tsugumi]
I told you NOT to call me mommy!

[Takeshi]
What?


75 :

{C4A553}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

Tsugumi and I looked at each other.

[Takeshi]
£o¢o's been calling you mommy, Tsugumi?


{C4A554}
[Tsugumi]
And she's calling you daddy, Takeshi?

[Takeshi]
She keeps doing it no matter what I say!


{C4A555}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Daddy? Mommy? Let's play!


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


76 :
After a while...

Tsugumi and I had begged £o¢o not to call us
'daddy' or 'mommy'.

It took us about three hours to finally
convince her.

It was three times more exhausting to
convince £o¢o than to dash with Y¤u on my
back AND swim 102 meters underwater.

Incidentally, £o¢o's reason for calling Tsugumi
'mommy' was...


{C4A556}
[£o¢o]
"A girl who doesn't have a mommy can call 
somebody who reminds her of mommy 'Mommy.'"


{C4A557}
[£o¢o]
It's written in the Naacal Tablet, isn't it?

...So she said.

Needless to say, £o¢o already had a real
mother.


77 :
After finally convincing £o¢o, I went to see
Y¤u.

Even before I had gone to rescue Chami, Y¤u
had seemed to be recovering her strength.

But the way she looked when she had first
started feeling pain didn't seem normal.

I was still concerned about her even though
she looked better.

So I decided to make sure Y¤u was alright.


Sora told me I could find Y¤u in the security
office.


78 :
I entered the room.

Y¤u was sitting in front of the console,
staring blankly at the screen.

[Takeshi]
Hi.

I called out a greeting as I sat down in the
seat next to her.

Y¤u grabbed a coffee cup, took a big gulp, and
said...


{C4A558}
[Y¤u]
Thank you.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C4A559}
[Y¤u]
"I didn't have a chance to say it earlier, 
right?"


{C4A560}
[Y¤u]
So, thank you.

Y¤u's eyes were fixed on the display.

[Takeshi]
"Are you talking about when I carried you to 
the infirmary earlier?"


{C4A561}
[Y¤u]
Yes.

[Takeshi]
You don't have to thank me.

[Takeshi]
I just want to ask you a question.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
What caused it anyway?


{C4A562}
[Y¤u]
Cause? What are you talking about?

Y¤u still wouldn't look at me.

[Takeshi]
"A normal, healthy person wouldn't just 
suddenly clutch their chest in pain, you know?"

[Takeshi]
And besides...

[Takeshi]
You said, 'It happens all the time.'

[Takeshi]
What is that all about?


79 :
When I asked, she turned the seat halfway and
stood up.


80 :

{C4A563}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari? Do you remember why I came to 
LeMU?"

Y¤u abruptly changed the subject.

I didn't understand why she was asking the
question, but I answered her anyway.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I do.

[Takeshi]
"You came to get a part-time job for the 
holidays..."

[Takeshi]
"But it was just an excuse to search for your 
father, who's been missing for seventeen years, 
right?"

I remembered the story Y¤u told me in front
of the merry-go-round the first day..


81 :

{S1C122}
[Y¤u]
"My mother has convinced herself that my father is 
already dead..."


{S1C123}
[Y¤u]
But, you know?


{S1C124}
[Y¤u]
I believe!


{S1C125}
[Y¤u]
I know that my dad is still alive somewhere!


{S1C126}
[Y¤u]
He has to be!


{S1C127}
[Y¤u]
"My father just went missing... and his remains 
were never found..."


82 :

{C4A564}
[Y¤u]
I just had to find out.


{C4A565}
[Y¤u]
If he was alive... or... dead...


{C4A566}
[Y¤u]
"If he's alive, of course I want to see 
him..."


{C4A567}
[Y¤u]
"And if he's dead, I wanted to find some kind 
of evidence."


83 :

{C4A568}
[Y¤u]
"Otherwise, I won't give up... I just can't 
accept it."


84 :
Just like that time, I didn't know what to
say to her.

The story of the 800-year-old nun came to my
mind.

Y¤u believed that the 800-year-old nun
actually existed.

How in the story, the sound of the bell had
stopped one day, but nobody actually found
her body.

When I came to think of it then, I realized
that was probably Y¤u's wish.

She was probably mixing her feelings about her
father's situation with the story of the nun.

It occurred to me like that.


{C4A569}
[Y¤u]
"And so that's what I was researching just 
now."

[Takeshi]
...And... did you... find out anything?


{C4A570}
[Y¤u]
Nothing.


{C4A571}
[Y¤u]
I can't figure out the password... I give up.


85 :
I looked at the monitor.

An authentication window was being displayed.

The cursor was flashing without a sound.

[Takeshi]
I see...

Biting her lip, Y¤u glanced down dejectedly.

She was wrapped in a hazy blue light from the
display.

I picked up the cup from the table and sipped
some of Y¤u's leftover coffee.

It was cold.

[Takeshi]
It's alright.

[Takeshi]
I know you'll... see him again...

I looked down into the cup.

The black coffee hid the bottom of the
cup from my view.


{C4A572}
[Y¤u]
Thank you...


{C4A573}
[Y¤u]
"But... I don't think I'll ever see him 
again..."

[Takeshi]
What?

I looked up in surprise.

Y¤u was forcing herself to smile.

She squinted her eyes and looked off into the
distance.


{C4A574}
[Y¤u]
"I came here because I thought I wanted to 
find out about my dad..."


{C4A575}
[Y¤u]
"But... I realize that actually wasn't it at 
all..."

[Takeshi]
...?


{C4A576}
[Y¤u]
I'm running out of time.


{C4A577}
[Y¤u]
I've gone way past my limit.


{C4A578}
[Y¤u]
So that's why...


{C4A579}
[Y¤u]
Before the time comes... I had to know...


{C4A580}
[Y¤u]
The truth...


86 :
(She's running out of time?)

(She doesn't think she'll ever see him
again...?)

'It happens all the time.'

(She'd been suffering with her hand on her
chest...)

No, it couldn't be...

I didn't even want to think about it.

Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath and
tried to shake bad thoughts from my mind.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Y¤u?

[Takeshi]
What do you mean by that...?


87 :
Y¤u crossed her arms behind her back and
started walking slowly away, head down.

She stopped in front of the wall, turned
around, and walked back in front of me.

The sound of her shoes echoed on the hard
floor...

The cursor silently flashing on the display...

The cold coffee in my hand...

I looked into the cup again.

The glossy liquid was rippling with small
waves.


{C4A581}
[Y¤u]
I can't tell you.

The sound of her shoes stopped abruptly.


88 :
[Takeshi]
Why...?

She raised her face quietly and said...


{C4A582}
[Y¤u]
"If I start telling you now, I might talk 
about things I don't want to talk about."

[Takeshi]
But...


89 :

{C4A583}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari...

Y¤u interrupted my words and went on.


{C4A584}
[Y¤u]
"Have you ever... done something wrong or 
sinned, Kuranari?"

[Takeshi]
Sinned?


{C4A585}
[Y¤u]
Yes...


{C4A586}
[Y¤u]
A massive sin...


{C4A587}
[Y¤u]
"I don't care whether you believe in God or 
not."


{C4A588}
[Y¤u]
"I'm asking you if you ever committed a sin 
that was morally wrong and there was nothing 
you could do to mend it."


90 :
{11:0-df}
{11:1}Yes

{11:1}No


91 :
[Takeshi]
Well...

[Takeshi]
I guess I might have...


{C4A589}
[Y¤u]
What have you done?

[Takeshi]
Well... different things, I guess...


{C4A590}
[Y¤u]
Things you can't tell me?

[Takeshi]
Uhhh...

[Takeshi]
"I don't really want to talk about it, to be 
honest."

[Takeshi]
"I think that sins are something you carry 
through life by yourself."

[Takeshi]
"It seems cowardly to me to pass the burden onto 
someone else and beg for pity and compassion."


{C4A591}
[Y¤u]
I feel the same way.


{C4A592}
[Y¤u]
That's why I can't tell you.


{C4A593}
[Y¤u]
"If I tell you now, it would just be an 
excuse..."

[Takeshi]
.........


{C4A594}
[Y¤u]
"I crossed a line that should've never been 
crossed."


{C4A595}
[Y¤u]
I turned my back on God...


92 :
[Takeshi]
Come on.

[Takeshi]
"I've made lots of mistakes. And you know why? 
Because I'm human."

[Takeshi]
"I'd be lying if I told you I'd never hurt 
people I cared about or broke their hearts."

[Takeshi]
"But I don't know if those are godless, 
massive sins..."


93 :

{C4A596}
[Y¤u]
Well... you're admirable.

[Takeshi]
What?


94 :

{C4A597}
[Y¤u]
No, I mean it.


{C4A598}
[Y¤u]
On the other hand...


{C4A599}
[Y¤u]
I'm...


{C4A600}
[Y¤u]
I'm not human anymore.


{C4A601}
[Y¤u]
"I crossed a line that should've never been 
crossed."


{C4A602}
[Y¤u]
I turned my back on God...


{C4A603}
[Y¤u]
That's why I can't tell you.


{C4A604}
[Y¤u]
"If I tell you now, it would just be an 
excuse..."

[Takeshi]
.........


95 :

{C4A605}
[Y¤u]
It's like an original sin to me.


{C4A606}
[Y¤u]
"I could never escape from it, and I don't 
intend to."


{C4A607}
[Y¤u]
As long as I live...


{C4A608}
[Y¤u]
"Yes, as long as I live, I must carry this 
sin with me."


{C4A609}
[Y¤u]
But, you know...?


{C4A610}
[Y¤u]
"You might think I'm horrible... but I don't 
regret anything."


{C4A611}
[Y¤u]
It's probably better this way...


{C4A612}
[Y¤u]
"Because, this way, I'm the only one who's 
sinned..."


{C4A613}
[Y¤u]
"That means I'm the only one who will be 
punished..."


{C4A614}
[Y¤u]
She has no sin to carry on.

[Takeshi]
...She?

[Takeshi]
Who are you talking about?


{C4A615}
[Y¤u]
About myself...


{C4A616}
[Y¤u]
My other self...

[Takeshi]
Your other self...?

[Takeshi]
"Are you telling me you have a split 
personality?"


96 :
Y¤u didn't say anything and took the cup from
my hand.

She sipped the cold coffee.

For some reason, Y¤u suddenly tilted the cup.

The black liquid, overtaken by the force of
gravity, went splashing to the floor.

[Takeshi]
Y-Y¤u...


97 :
Y¤u's eyes were fixed on me.

There was no expression on her face.

All the emotion had gone from her face, and I
couldn't read what she was thinking.

Her eyes were dark, dull, and without a
spark, like a pair of ash gray glass beads.

Eventually, Y¤u whispered.


98 :

{C4A617}
[Y¤u]
She is...


{C4A618}
[Y¤u]
My sister.

[Takeshi]
Your sister...?


{C4A619}
[Y¤u]
Yes...


{C4A620}
[Y¤u]
And at the same time, she is me.


{C4A621}
[Y¤u]
She and I are...


{C4A622}
[Y¤u]
Twins, you see...


{C4A623}
[Y¤u]
She is my...


{C4A624}
[Y¤u]
Twin sister...
