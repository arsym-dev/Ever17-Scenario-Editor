1 :
'Life readings: 6'

And the exact number of humans trapped was...


2 :
{11:0-0d}
{11:1}'6'

{11:1}'5'


3 :
Six people.

Y¤u, Sara, Tsugumi, Takeshi, me... and Sora.

No matter how many times I checked, the number
stayed the same.

It was probably like Y¤u said‡Lthe sensor was
just malfunctioning.


4 :

{C1S114}
[Takeshi]
"Well, either way, we can check by walking
around the complex, right?"


5 :

{C1S115}
[Takeshi]
But first, we need to go secure Tsugumi!


6 :

{C1S116}
[Y¤u]
Secure? You mean save?


7 :

{C1S117}
[Takeshi]
Saving is removing an object from danger.


{C1S118}
[Takeshi]
Securing is removing danger itself.


8 :
[Kid]
"Wait! That's not right! There's something
strange about it!"


9 :
I protested.

[Kid]
"There are only five people that didn't 
escape in time!"

[Kid]
But the bio scan is showing six.

[Kid]
So there has to be somebody else in LeMU!


10 :

{C1S119}
[Sara]
Huh? Why do you say there are five people?


11 :

{C1S120}
[Sara]
"Sora, Tsugumi, Takeshi, the Kid, Nakkyu... and 
me."


{C1S121}
[Sara]
That's six.

[Kid]
No. Sara... that's wrong...


12 :
[Kid]
The thing is, Sora is...

The words jumped out of my mouth.

[Kid]
The thing is, Sora is...


13 :
[Kid]
Sora is...

[Kid]
She's not really here.


14 :

{C1S122}
[Sara]
She's not here...?


15 :

{C1S123}
[Takeshi]
What're you talking about, Kid?

[Kid]
Sora is... an RSD-generated image.


16 :

{C1S124}
[Sara]
Wh-what!?


17 :

{C1S125}
[Takeshi]
RSD!?

[Kid]
"It's a system that uses semiconductor lasers 
to project an image directly onto a person's 
retina."

[Kid]
"In other words, the Sora that we're seeing 
is just an image."

Sara and Takeshi's jaws dropped, and they
blinked again and again.

Being an employee of LeMU, I figured that Y¤u
had known that from the start. She didn't
look surprised, but just gazed off into
the distance.

As for Sora...


18 :

{C1S126}
[Sora]
Yes. It is exactly as Kid-san states.


{C1S127}
[Sora]
I am not flesh and blood.


{C1S128}
[Sora]
I have no form... I am merely an image.


{C1S129}
[Sora]
"My thoughts and personality are all 
controlled by an AI program."


19 :

{C1S130}
[Takeshi]
No way...


20 :

{C1S131}
[Sora]
You don't believe me?


21 :

{C1S132}
[Takeshi]
Of course not! I mean, Sora, you're here...


22 :

{C1S133}
[Sora]
"Actually, your disbelief is really quite a 
compliment."


23 :

{C1S134}
[Sora]
However, Kuranari-san... it is a fact.


24 :

{C1S135}
[Sara]
R-really...?


25 :
Looking scared, Sara reached her right hand
out toward Sora.

Her arm met no resistance as it plunged into
Sora's body.


26 :

{C1S136}
[Sara]
Wow...

Sara reflexively snapped her hand back...


27 :

{C1S137}
[Sora]
Now do you understand?

[Sara]
.........


28 :
[Takeshi]
.........


29 :
Takeshi and Sara froze, immobile, like they
were cutout pictures.

[Kid]
Hey. You get it now, right?

[Kid]
"So Sora isn't detected by the bio scan 
sensors."


30 :

{C1S138}
[Y¤u]
That's right...

Y¤u finally broke her silence.


{C1S139}
[Y¤u]
"Sora shouldn't be counted by the bio scan 
sensors, so this number... Six can't be 
the right number."

[Kid]
I told you so.

[Kid]
"So that means that somebody else is here 
besides us."


31 :

{C1S140}
[Y¤u]
Stop!


32 :

{C1S141}
[Y¤u]
Were you listening to what I just said?

[Kid]
?


{C1S142}
[Y¤u]
"By 'can't be the right number', I mean that 
there's some kind of malfunction."


33 :

{C1S143}
[Y¤u]
Think about it.


{C1S144}
[Y¤u]
It didn't just display the number six, right?


34 :

{C1S145}
[Y¤u]
"The first time we looked, it was saying 
seven too."


{C1S146}
[Y¤u]
"Then it would jump between five, six, and 
seven."


35 :

{C1S147}
[Y¤u]
How do you explain that?

[Kid]
.........


36 :

{C1S148}
[Y¤u]
"Even if, like you say, there were other 
people that didn't get out of here in time..."


{C1S149}
[Y¤u]
"You think somebody would suddenly appear, 
disappear, or split into two people?"

[Kid]
Well... how am I supposed to know...?


37 :

{C1S150}
[Y¤u]
See.

[Kid]
"But if somebody else were here, what would 
you do?"

[Kid]
"Why don't we just search and then call it quits 
if we don't find anyone."

[Kid]
"I don't see any reason that you could have 
against searching."


38 :

{C1S151}
[Y¤u]
I'm not against it.


{C1S152}
[Y¤u]
"But this is just a computer glitch, and 
I don't think we should let it go controlling 
us and making us all upset."

[Kid]
So you really are against it.


39 :

{C1S153}
[Y¤u]
I said I'm not.

[Kid]
.........


40 :

{C1S154}
[Y¤u]
Geez... Fine. I got it. Enough of this...


{C1S155}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, should we go search for 
this 'someone'?"

I gave a big nod.


41 :
At that point...


42 :

{C1S156}
[Sora]
Uh... But Komachi-san...

Sora said it hesitantly.


43 :

{C1S157}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that's right.


44 :

{C1S158}
[Y¤u]
"The reason we all came here was to find out 
where Tsugumi went."


45 :

{C1S159}
[Sora]
Correct.


{C1S160}
[Sora]
"So wouldn't it be logical to search LeMU 
while we determine the location of Komachi-san?"

[Kid]
Okay. Sounds good.

[Kid]
Well, let's get started then.

[Kid]
Tsugumi was on Zweiter Stock, right?


46 :

{C1S161}
[Sora]
Yes.


47 :
Sara and Takeshi didn't react at all.

I imagined they still couldn't quite swallow
the idea that Sora was an image.

The two were frozen stiff with their eyes
completely absorbed by Sora.

[Kid]
"What are you doing? Hurry up! Let's get 
going!"

I tugged Sara and Takeshi by the arm, leading
them from the control room.


48 :
We climbed the emergency stairs, aiming for
the floor that Tsugumi was on.

Only Sora remained in the control room,
thinking of ways to escape, trying to
reestablish communications, rechecking
the complex, and trying to get other
systems that were down back online.


49 :
We arrived at Zweiter Stock...

And when we did, a voice came from the speaker
above the corridor.


{C1S162}
[Sora]
Right now, Komachi-san...


{C1S163}
[Sora]
...Seems to be in the security office.

I figured Sora was using the complex's
intercom system to announce
Tsugumi's location.


50 :

{C1S164}
[Y¤u]
Alright. The security office, huh?

Y¤u said that toward the ceiling.


51 :
On the way to the office...

Takeshi said...


52 :

{C1S165}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, that surprised the heck outta me... 
Sora being AI."


{C1S166}
[Sara]
"I know, it's crazy to think that she's 
only an image."


{C1S167}
[Sara]
"I mean... she said something about a laser 
projected onto the retina..."

Takeshi and Sara were as excited as two kids
experiencing Halloween for the first time.


53 :

{C1S168}
[Takeshi]
"But Y¤u knew, right? That Sora is 
RSD-generated."


54 :

{C1S169}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. I work here, after all.


55 :

{C1S170}
[Sara]
Well, why didn't you tell us?


56 :

{C1S171}
[Y¤u]
Well... basically...


57 :

{C1S172}
[Y¤u]
I didn't think it was what Sora wanted.


58 :

{C1S173}
[Y¤u]
"Sora herself didn't say anything about being 
AI or RSD, right?"


{C1S174}
[Y¤u]
"The fact that she's been quiet about it 
tells me that she probably wanted to keep it 
a secret from everybody."


59 :

{C1S175}
[Y¤u]
"If she didn't, then she would have told you 
all about it long ago. Don't you think?"


60 :

{C1S176}
[Y¤u]
So I didn't tell you.


61 :

{C1S177}
[Y¤u]
"I didn't think I should be the one to tell 
you."


62 :

{C1S178}
[Sara]
Hmmmm...


{C1S179}
[Takeshi]
I get it...

[Kid]
So I shouldn't have said that?


63 :

{C1S180}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
"You said that Sora wanted to keep all of 
the AI and RSD stuff a secret, right?"


64 :
[Kid]
And I went and told everybody all about it...

[Kid]
Sora might be mad...


65 :

{C1S181}
[Y¤u]
That's silly...


66 :

{C1S182}
[Sora]
Not in the least, Kid-san.


67 :
[Kid]
S-Sora...!

Suddenly, Sora appeared before everyone.

We stopped, surprised...


68 :

{C1S183}
[Sora]
"It is something that I thought I needed to 
tell you..."


69 :

{C1S184}
[Sora]
"Besides, it is not something that I was 
desperately trying to hide."


70 :

{C1S185}
[Sora]
So please, try not to worry about it.


71 :

{C1S186}
[Sara]
Wait just a second...


72 :

{C1S187}
[Sara]
"So how did the Kid know about Sora's 
identity?"


73 :
[Kid]
...Uh... I...?


{C1S188}
[Sora]
"Kid-san, you should not have any memories from 
before you fell into the pond, correct?"

[Kid]
Uh, yeah...


74 :

{C1S189}
[Takeshi]
"So that means that somebody must've told you 
about Sora after that."

[Kid]
No one... told... me...


{C1S190}
[Sara]
So how did you know?

[Kid]
That... Uh... I... Um...


75 :
(Not again...)

I thought about it.

It was the same as the time I had blurted out
Sara's name.

I knew something that there was no way
I could know.

The fact that Sora was an RSD image.

When, where, why, from whom, and how could
I have heard that...?

It was like one memory had broken free from
the frozen iceberg of my past...

I was confused by the memory's image...

{16:4}

76 :
[Kid]
I don't know...

[Kid]
I don't know how I know...

[Kid]
How could I know? What is there in my past?

[Kid]
Somebody... tell me...


77 :
[Sara]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Sora]
.........

The four of them looked at each other.


78 :

{C1S191}
[Sara]
You guys, this is completely bizarre!


{C1S192}
[Sara]
"And it's not just this... The Kid knew 
my name too."


79 :

{C1S193}
[Sora]
He knew your name, Matsunaga-san?


{C1S194}
[Sara]
Yup.


80 :

{C1S195}
[Sara]
"What was it he had? Life amnesia or 
something?"


81 :

{C1S196}
[Sara]
"That has to do only with the loss of memories 
that are directly related to the person, 
right?"


82 :

{C1S197}
[Sara]
But he knew about me and Sora...


83 :

{C1S198}
[Y¤u]
Wait a second, Mayo.


{C1S199}
[Y¤u]
I told you not to pressure the Kid.


84 :

{C1S200}
[Takeshi]
"But... maybe it's just the opposite. Maybe he 
needs it."


{C1S201}
[Takeshi]
I mean... he found the edge of his memory.


{C1S202}
[Takeshi]
"Maybe if he doesn't try to pull stuff back 
from the other side, it'll disappear for good."


85 :

{C1S203}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, I understand what you're saying.


{C1S204}
[Y¤u]
But think about our situation right now.


86 :

{C1S205}
[Sora]
I agree with Tanaka-san.


{C1S206}
[Sora]
"No one here has specialty knowledge of
this disorder, nor are they capable of 
providing counseling."


87 :

{C1S207}
[Sora]
"In other words... if Kid-san's condition were 
to worsen, there is nothing we could do to 
help him."


88 :

{C1S208}
[Y¤u]
So we have to stick with what we've got.


{C1S209}
[Y¤u]
"He can still get his memory back after we get 
out of here."

Sara and Takeshi didn't looked satisfied.

Maybe I had gotten used to that kind of thing.
My head didn't hurt, and I didn't feel confused.


But I was terribly tired.

I was absolutely beat, and there was no way
I was getting any closer to my memory.

My memory was like a lone island shrouded
in a fog.


89 :

{C1S210}
[Sara]
"Well, if that's what you think... 
then that's fine."


90 :

{C1S211}
[Sara]
"Besides... we've got things to find before his 
memory."


91 :

{C1S212}
[Y¤u]
Things to find?


92 :

{C1S213}
[Sora]
She is referring to Komachi-san.


93 :
The five of us went in the security office.

Tsugumi was there.


94 :

{C1S214}
[Tsugumi]
What are you guys doing here?


{C1S215}
[Takeshi]
What are YOU doing here?


{C1S216}
[Tsugumi]
Do you want me to tell you?


95 :

{C1S217}
[Takeshi]
Yeah.


96 :

{C1S218}
[Tsugumi]
"I was trying to find out what you're 
plotting."


97 :

{C1S219}
[Takeshi]
Oh... You're still stuck on that, huh?


98 :

{C1S220}
[Takeshi]
Are you sick in the head? Paranoid, maybe?

[Tsugumi]
.........


99 :

{C1S221}
[Y¤u]
Let her look. That'll be the best anyway.


{C1S222}
[Y¤u]
"Then she'll realize that we're not scheming 
anything."

[Tsugumi]
.........


100 :

{C1S223}
[Sara]
"Tsugumi, what is it you're so suspicious 
about?"


{C1S224}
[Sara]
What do you think we did?


101 :

{C1S225}
[Tsugumi]
It has nothing to do with you.


102 :

{C1S226}
[Sara]
Don't say that!


103 :

{C1S227}
[Sara]
I wish you... wouldn't talk like that...

Sara clenched her fist, and her shoulders shook.


104 :

{C1S228}
[Tsugumi]
That's not what I meant.


105 :

{C1S229}
[Sara]
...Huh?


106 :

{C1S230}
[Tsugumi]
You... Your name is Sara, right?


107 :

{C1S231}
[Sara]
Y-yes.


{C1S232}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not suspicious of you, Sara.


{C1S233}
[Tsugumi]
So this thing has nothing to do with you.


108 :

{C1S234}
[Sara]
What do you mean?


{C1S235}
[Tsugumi]
"You came here on a field trip or something, 
right?"


109 :

{C1S236}
[Tsugumi]
So... you're here 'by chance'.


110 :

{C1S237}
[Sora]
"It would also seem that Tanaka-san,
Kuranari-san, Kid-san... everyone also
failed to escape by chance."


111 :

{C1S238}
[Tsugumi]
What are you saying?


112 :

{C1S239}
[Tsugumi]
"There's no way that something like this 
could occur 'by chance'."


113 :
[Kid]
What do you mean by 'something like this'?


{C1S240}
[Tsugumi]
"Everything! Everything that's happening 
here!"

[Kid]
"So you're saying that the accident and all 
didn't happen by chance?"


{C1S241}
[Tsugumi]
Of course that's what I mean.


114 :

{C1S242}
[Takeshi]
You mean like somebody planned it?


115 :

{C1S243}
[Tsugumi]
Not somebody... YOU ALL did.


116 :

{C1S244}
[Y¤u]
Aha... Ahaha... Ahahahahaha...


117 :

{C1S245}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what's so funny?


118 :

{C1S246}
[Y¤u]
It's... I mean...


119 :

{C1S247}
[Y¤u]
You have to laugh.

[Tsugumi]
.........


120 :

{C1S248}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari. How old are you?


121 :

{C1S249}
[Takeshi]
Who? Me? I'm 20.


{C1S250}
[Y¤u]
I'm eighteen.


122 :

{C1S251}
[Y¤u]
"Nobody knows the Kid's age... but he's 
definitely younger than me."


{C1S252}
[Y¤u]
"You think the three of us could cause this 
kind of massive accident?"


123 :

{C1S253}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, with just the three of you, it might be 
impossible."


{C1S254}
[Tsugumi]
But...


124 :

{C1S255}
[Tsugumi]
Akanegasaki Sora‡LYou could do it, right?


{C1S256}
[Sara]
Sora?


125 :

{C1S257}
[Y¤u]
Sora?


{C1S258}
[Takeshi]
Sora?

[Kid]
Sora could?


126 :
[Sora]
...............


{C1S259}
[Tsugumi]
Sora is one of LeMMIH's programs.


{C1S260}
[Tsugumi]
"The only one that could do whatever they 
wanted with the LeMU system is you, Sora."


127 :

{C1S261}
[Sora]
I... I... I...


128 :

{C1S262}
[Sara]
Tsugumi! Don't be stupid!


129 :

{C1S263}
[Tsugumi]
"I've already told you that this has nothing 
to do with you, Sara."


{C1S264}
[Sara]
Of course it has to do with me!


{C1S265}
[Sara]
"Everybody that's here right now is working 
together to get out of here!"


130 :

{C1S266}
[Sara]
We're not just strangers anymore!


131 :

{C1S267}
[Sara]
But... But you just...


132 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


133 :

{C1S268}
[Sara]
"Anyway, I want you to stop telling everyone
these conspiracy theories."


134 :

{C1S269}
[Sara]
You've got it all wrong...

Sara stared intensely at Tsugumi.

Tsugumi avoided her eyes.

It was a period of awkward silence...

Everyone scanned each other's faces, trying to
gauge what the others were thinking.


{C1S270}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sorry, Sara...


135 :
Tsugumi left the security office with her eyes
down.


136 :

{C1S271}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi, wait!


137 :

{C1S272}
[Sara]
Tsugumi!


138 :
Y¤u and Sara dashed out of the room after
Tsugumi.

That left Sora, Takeshi, and me.

Again, silence enveloped us.

We tried to get rid of the awkwardness by
staring at the monitors, picking our nails, and
fiddling with the lint on our clothes.


139 :

{C1S273}
[Sora]
Well... I'll go back to the control room.


{C1S274}
[Sora]
"As soon as I learn anything, I will contact 
everyone..."


140 :
Sora left Takeshi and me with those words.


Takeshi looked at me and shrugged.


141 :

{C1S275}
[Takeshi]
Here we go again...

[Kid]
...


142 :

{C1S276}
[Takeshi]
Okay, whaddya wanna do?

[Kid]
What do you mean?


{C1S277}
[Takeshi]
Should we go after Tsugumi?

[Kid]
"I think the same thing would just happen 
again..."


143 :

{C1S278}
[Takeshi]
Then what?

[Kid]
I don't know...


144 :

{C1S279}
[Takeshi]
For now, we could take a look around.

[Kid]
"Yeah. We still haven't figured out the 
problem with the bio scan number."


{C1S280}
[Takeshi]
"You mean that 'mystery somebody', the one who 
didn't escape?"

[Kid]
"Yeah. So let's check around LeMU one more 
time..."


145 :

{C1S281}
[Takeshi]
You wanna split up and look?


{C1S282}
[Takeshi]
"I could take the bottom floor, and you could 
take Zweiter Stock..."

[Kid]
Sounds good.


146 :
So Takeshi and I split up to search.

We agreed to meet up at 9:30 p.m.

We were to meet in front of the
security office.


147 :
I looked around Zweiter Stock.

[Kid]
Is there anybody there? If so, answer me!

I made the rounds of all the rooms...

...But I didn't find anyone.

And it was about time to meet up with Takeshi.


148 :
I headed to the front of the security office.


But...


149 :
Takeshi was nowhere to be seen.

[Kid]
Hey! Takeshi!

I called out to him, but there was no answer.

Glancing at the door of the security office,
I saw that it was open.

I decided to take a peek inside the room.


150 :
No one was there...

[Kid]
Hey! Sora! Do you know where Takeshi went?

I looked up at the bare ceiling and called out.

I figured Sora would be in the control room
monitoring me.

But apparently she wasn't...

The speakers in the ceiling remained painfully
silent.
