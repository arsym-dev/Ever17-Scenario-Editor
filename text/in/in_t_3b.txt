1 :
We were just killing time...

We still couldn't think of any way to escape.


Still, we didn't want to feel like we were
completely wasting our time.

So we all decided to wander around LeMU one
more time.

As we made the rounds, I said things like...

'Let's find something decent to eat - no more 
of those tuna sandwiches from the kiosk!'

And 'How many people can really ride on an
Ei that doesn't have enough buoyancy?'

I also made other ridiculous propositions.

Everyone was getting a little sick of me, but
they still laughed along.

We all knew...

As long as we were doing something, it kept
our minds off things we couldn't change...

Like about how there was no way out, or
remembering where we were.


2 :
We decided to meet at 8 p.m. for dinner.

Everyone was left to wander around freely
until then.

(Still an hour to go...)


3 :
As I walked around the second floor, still
thinking about what to do, I found myself in
front of the infirmary.

I thought Tsugumi would still be sleeping in
bed.

(Maybe I should check on her...?)

As I stood in front of the sliding door, it
opened.


4 :
I could smell the faint but harsh odor of
disinfectant.


5 :

{T3B000}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, what are you doing here?

Y¤u greeted me with slight surprise as I
entered the room.

[Takeshi]
"Nothing, really. I just thought I'd get 
some coffee or something to wake me up."

[Takeshi]
"What about you two? 
What are you and the Kid up to?"

It looked like she was in the middle of
spreading out tools and parts next to the
'L-MRI' scanner.

The Kid was crouched down by the scanner as
well, looking at what appeared to be pages of
data.


6 :

{T3B001}
[Y¤u]
"Well... you know, I thought I'd try to fix 
this machine after all."

[Takeshi]
Wow. And the Kid's helping?


{T3B002}
[Kid]
You got it.


7 :

{T3B003}
[Y¤u]
"He's much more helpful than he looks. He's 
really quick at reading blueprints..."

[Takeshi]
"Sometimes that happens, where the Kid'll be 
strangely good at something. I wonder why 
that is?"


{T3B004}
[Kid]
That's what I'd like to know.

[Takeshi]
You have no idea?


8 :

{T3B005}
[Kid]
Nope... not a clue.


{T3B006}
[Kid]
There might be some reason, but...

The Kid hung his head, thinking.


9 :

{T3B007}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, hey, don't worry about it. No use 
wondering about it now."


{T3B008}
[Y¤u]
"It'll all make sense anyway when your memory 
comes back."


10 :

{T3B009}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kid, can you hand me that wrench?


11 :

{T3B010}
[Kid]
This one?


{T3B011}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, thanks. Here we go.


12 :
Y¤u sat cross-legged on the floor and began to
unscrew the cover of the scanner.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, I can see up your skirt when you sit 
like that."


13 :

{T3B012}
[Y¤u]
"Cut that out! Quit looking, this isn't a 
peep show!"

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright, I was just joking...

I raised both hands and backed away.


14 :
[Takeshi]
"But you know, while the Kid's head is clear, 
maybe we should tackle some of the trickier 
problems."


15 :

{T3B013}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Why?

[Takeshi]
"Because, what if he hit his head or 
something, and he's only going to be good at 
this stuff for a little bit?"

[Takeshi]
"Maybe it jostled some brains cells into 
action that don't usually get used..."


16 :

{T3B014}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, please. This isn't like some manga.
Right, Kid?"


{T3B015}
[Kid]
Listen, don't ask me...


17 :

{T3B016}
[Y¤u]
Hm? Oh... That's right.


18 :

{T3B017}
[Kid]
So what's a manga again?


19 :

{T3B018}
[Y¤u]
What!? You've even forgotten manga?


20 :

{T3B019}
[Kid]
"Well, I have a vague sense that I've heard 
the word before..."


21 :

{T3B020}
[Y¤u]
"Wow, to forget about manga... You know, 
you're missing out on about 20% of 
life right there..."

The Kid and Y¤u continued their strange
conversation...

...And I started to feel like there was no
real reason for me to be there at all.

[Takeshi]
Well, hang in there.


22 :
I turned my back to leave.


23 :

{T3B021}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari...

Y¤u stood up abruptly and came to stand in
front of me.


24 :

{T3B022}
[Y¤u]
You came to check on Tsugumi, right?


{T3B023}
[Y¤u]
She's sleeping in that bed over there.


25 :

{T3B024}
[Y¤u]
"She isn't conscious yet, and of course she 
can't move her body... She really just needs 
to rest."

Y¤u was speaking slowly, her eyes downcast.

For some reason, her expression hardened.


26 :

{T3B025}
[Y¤u]
"And it's not that I'm so sure of myself, 
but... still, I've done my very best for her..."


{T3B026}
[Y¤u]
"I can't guarantee that she will, but I want 
her to get better..."


{T3B027}
[Y¤u]
So we'll just...

[Takeshi]
"I know, Y¤u. And I'm really grateful for what 
you've done."

I looked her straight in the eyes.

[Takeshi]
"If you hadn't done the surgery, Tsugumi 
wouldn't have made it."


27 :

{T3B028}
[Y¤u]
"But we still don't know if she will really 
recover..."

[Takeshi]
"You worry too much. What? Don't you trust 
yourself?"


28 :

{T3B029}
[Y¤u]
No.


{T3B030}
[Y¤u]
I'm not a trained doctor or anything...

[Takeshi]
"I don't think that Tsugumi will give up so 
easily."

[Takeshi]
She'll pull through... I know it.

[Takeshi]
"She'll be just like she was before in no 
time and giving me a hard time as usual for 
sure."

[Y¤u]
.........


29 :

{T3B031}
[Y¤u]
"I guess so. Actually, I'm starting to feel 
the same way."

She gave me a small smile.

[Takeshi]
"Well then, I guess I'm off to see that 
mean-spirited girl's face..."

[Takeshi]
So fix that scanner, okay?


30 :

{T3B032}
[Y¤u]
Just leave it to me!


31 :
Y¤u plopped down again, and she and the Kid
began grappling with the coverless scanner.

I went toward the bed in the back.


32 :
Tsugumi was stretched out peacefully.

It was probably due to the serious nature of
the operation, but she was getting an IV.

At least she wasn't hooked up to a
respirator. Then again, that could have been
because the infirmary didn't have a
respirator...

Thankfully, she didn't look like she was in
pain.

She was sleeping so serenely.

I could almost believe that she would recover
quickly.

I remembered how she dragged me behind her as
she ran through the aquarium. How tough she
was, so much stamina.

She lay under a white blanket.


33 :
Her right foot was completely covered with a
brace and bandages.

I couldn't tell what kind of condition it was
in.

(Ah...)

I realized something as I neared the bed.

That smell of antiseptic that I had first
recognized when I came into the room...

It was still strong and harsh around the bed.

I looked down at the floor, and it was as if
the tiles were blurring, changing color.

(It's the color... of her blood...)

It was the raw, brutal traces of the surgery.

I gently squeezed Tsugumi's hand, which was
peeking out from under the blanket.

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry.

It was my fault that this had happened to her.


If she didn't make it...

It wasn't the kind of thing made better by an
apology.

And even if she did recover...

What would I say to her face?

It would only be natural for her to hit me
or yell at me.

[Takeshi]
...So sorry.

All I could do was repeat it over and over to
Tsugumi, who couldn't even answer.


34 :

{T3B033}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san.

There was a voice behind me.

Letting go of Tsugumi's hand, I quickly
whirled around.


35 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora...

Sora had suddenly appeared behind me.


{T3B034}
[Sora]
"It is unlikely that Komachi-san will wake up for 
a while."


{T3B035}
[Sora]
"The anesthetic is still in effect... It is 
probably best to leave her alone right now."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I suppose you're right...


{T3B036}
[Sora]
So, Kuranari-san, are you free right now?

[Takeshi]
Who, me?


{T3B037}
[Sora]
"Yes. If it is alright, I would like to 
talk to you."

[Takeshi]
Talk about what?


{T3B038}
[Sora]
Well, you see...


36 :

{T3B039}
[Sora]
It's, um, um, a secret.

She laughed a little.

(Sora wants to keep something secret...?)

I was a little shocked...


37 :

{T3B040}
[Sora]
This room is... Well, why don't we go outside?

38 :
{11:0-b0}
{11:1}Don't go

{11:1}Go


39 :
[Takeshi]
"Actually, I want to stay here a little bit 
longer, if you don't mind."

[Takeshi]
"It isn't often that you get to see Tsugumi 
being so still and docile."


40 :

{T3B041}
[Sora]
Really...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. Can't you talk to me here? Now 
you've got me wondering what the big secret 
is."


{T3B042}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T3B043}
[Sora]
"I can't talk to you here because it's 
confidential."

[Takeshi]
Oh, right. That makes sense... Let's see.


41 :

{T3B044}
[Sora]
"...Never mind, it's not a big deal. We can 
discuss it later."

[Takeshi]
Ah.


{T3B045}
[Sora]
If you'll excuse me, then.


42 :
Sora left, smiling.


43 :
I turned my attention again to Tsugumi's
sleeping face.

She didn't say anything.

Of course, it was normal for Tsugumi not to
talk about herself...

But instead, she wasn't saying anything at all.

...I wanted to hear something.

As soon as possible.

Anything, I didn't care, I just wanted to hear
Tsugumi's voice again.

I began to believe that I could bear even her
harshest, most cutting words.


44 :
(What?)

I turned my head, sure I had been mistaken.

The lift to the decompression chamber was
moving on its own...

Sure enough, it was moving.

I ran over and peered into the square hole
where the lift was.

The lift had gone down, then stopped.

(That's strange...)

I pushed the button calling the lift
and hopped in.

I would go down to the decompression chamber.


45 :
No one was in the room.

Was the lift malfunctioning?

I reached out my hand to push the button to
take me back up.

In that second, something crossed my line of
vision.

The sound of tiny footsteps was growing
fainter...

Very tiny.

I could tell that they were running through
the emergency corridor.


46 :
I turned into the corridor and followed the
sound.

I didn't think they were human footsteps.

(Maybe it's Pipi?)

But if Pipi had separated from £o¢o, he surely
wouldn't be in a place like that.

I sensed that the owner of the footsteps was
something smaller.

It seemed to be running with quite some
momentum.

Sometimes even crashing into walls.

It was in a desperate hurry.

(In any case, it's an animal of some kind.)

(But... what is it?)

It bothered me that it had run out of the
infirmary.


47 :
The footsteps turned off the corridor and
straight into a dead end.

I had followed it right up until that point...
but somehow, I lost it.

Maybe it fell down the stairs along the
corridor or climbed into a duct and jumped
down a floor.

(That clever little...)

Maybe it was... a rat?

...Could be. It wouldn't be so strange for
LeMU to have rats.

In which case...

[Takeshi]
This is stupid.

[Takeshi]
"What the hell am I doing, chasing after a 
rat?"

Scratching my head, I retraced my steps.


48 :
Before I got back in the lift, I glanced back
into the decompression chamber and noticed
for the first time that the bed was looking
dirty.

[Takeshi]
Hey, who ate their dinner here...?

There were small breadcrumbs on the bed.


49 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Y¤u!


50 :

{T3B046}
[Y¤u]
Yeah?

I got out of the lift and stomped over to
where Y¤u and the Kid were still in the
middle of their repair efforts.


51 :
[Takeshi]
"Who was eating bread in the decompression 
chamber?"


52 :

{T3B047}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What are you talking about?

Y¤u frowned and turned the hand holding the
screwdriver toward me.


{T3B048}
[Y¤u]
How would I know?


{T3B049}
[Kid]
I don't know either.

The Kid had insulation tape wrapped around his
fingers.


53 :

{T3B050}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari-san, you sure it wasn't you?

[Takeshi]
"Why would it be me if I'm the one asking 
about it...?"

[Takeshi]
"I mean, it doesn't really matter who it was, 
but don't you think we'd better be a little 
more careful?"


54 :

{T3B051}
[Kid]
Careful of what?

[Takeshi]
I think there was a rat in here just now.

[Takeshi]
"If we leave food laying around, it might get 
eaten."


55 :

{T3B052}
[Y¤u]
"Oh... In that case, I guess we should be more 
careful."


{T3B053}
[Y¤u]
"We've got plenty of food in the kiosk for 
now, but it would be awful if it was broken 
into."


{T3B054}
[Kid]
Do you think we should try to catch it?

[Takeshi]
I don't think we need to go that far.


56 :

{T3B055}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kid, you don't happen to know how to 
make a rat trap, do you?"


57 :

{T3B056}
[Kid]
Who knows...?


58 :

{T3B057}
[Kid]
I don't really know if I know how or not.

The Kid laughed and shrugged his shoulders
exaggeratedly.


59 :
[Takeshi]
Okay. Where are you going?


{T3B058}
[Sora]
To the dolphins...


{T3B059}
[Sora]
To the Dolphin Carousel. I like that place.

[Takeshi]
Alright. Let's go.


60 :
As we left the infirmary, Y¤u and the Kid were
looking at me with curious expressions on
their faces.

[Takeshi]
"What's up with them, looking like they were 
just bit on the butt by something?"


61 :

{T3B060}
[Sora]
Heehee...

Sora answered me with an amused laugh.


{T3B061}
[Sora]
"They thought that you were talking to 
yourself."

[Takeshi]
Huh, okay...

[Takeshi]
No, wait, why? I was talking with you.


{T3B062}
[Sora]
"Didn't I say that I wanted to talk to you 
about something secret?"

[Takeshi]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
...A-ah. Now I get it...

Apparently, Y¤u and the Kid couldn't see Sora.


62 :
We reached the Dolphin Carousel.

The circling dolphins stood still in the
silence.


63 :

{T3B063}
[Sora]
It's so quiet...


{T3B064}
[Sora]
"Sometimes, it seems that the everyday hubbub 
is all an empty lie..."

Sora spoke quietly.


64 :

{T3B065}
[Sora]
"I apologize, that was inappropriate. It 
doesn't fit the moment."

[Takeshi]
"No, I don't mind. If I had known about this 
place days before..."

[Takeshi]
"...Yeah, and if I'd seen it back in the days 
when it was full of people, I'd probably be 
thinking the same thing."

[Takeshi]
Sora, how long have you been here at LeMU?


65 :

{T3B066}
[Sora]
"I started working at a functional level in 
April of 2011."


{T3B067}
[Sora]
So since then.

[Takeshi]
Six years, huh...


{T3B068}
[Sora]
Yes, that is correct.


{T3B069}
[Sora]
2223 days...


66 :
Sora narrowed her eyes.

She was nearly overcome by some feeling.

Could it be nostalgia?

It didn't seem like a programmed emotion.

She must have treasured her memories of that place.


We gazed at the figures of the silent
dolphins for a while.

[Takeshi]
So listen, Sora.

I broke in, hoping it was the right moment.


67 :

{T3B070}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it?

[Takeshi]
"You said you had to talk to me about a 
secret."

[Takeshi]
Are you ready to tell me about it?


{T3B071}
[Sora]
Ah yes, that's right.


68 :
She straightened and turned to face me.


69 :
Then, suddenly, her face shone as she said...


{T3B072}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, shall we play tag?

[Takeshi]
...Huh?

[Takeshi]
What...?


70 :

{T3B073}
[Sora]
Kick the can was so much fun yesterday!


{T3B074}
[Sora]
So won't you play tag with me?

[Takeshi]
Tag?

I couldn't quite grasp the connection.


71 :

{T3B075}
[Sora]
Come on, Kuranari-san, you have to...


{T3B076}
[Sora]
Try and catch me!


72 :
She casually floated up off the ground and
moved off as if she were gliding.

[Takeshi]
Hey, wait a minute, Sora...


73 :

{T3B077}
[Sora]
Come on, this way!

[Takeshi]
Where did you go!?

I immediately looked around for her.


74 :

{T3B078}
[Sora]
Right here!


75 :

{T3B079}
[Sora]
Over here!


76 :

{T3B080}
[Sora]
Where are you looking?


77 :
She would flicker into view here and there
and then disappear again.

[Takeshi]
Hey! You!


78 :

{T3B081}
[Sora]
This way, this way!


79 :

{T3B082}
[Sora]
What's the matter?


80 :

{T3B083}
[Sora]
I'm right here!


81 :
Laughing, she would show herself in one
place and then disappear.

[Takeshi]
Oh, come on! What IS this!?

[Takeshi]
You know as well as I do...

[Takeshi]
There's no way I can catch you...

[Takeshi]
"No matter what I do, I can't grab hold of 
you!"


82 :

{T3B084}
[Sora A]
What!? Really?


{T3B085}
[Sora B]
No, surely not...!


{T3B086}
[Sora C]
I see... Heehee, I didn't realize that.

She was playing dumb.

Sora had split into three images...

[Takeshi]
What the heck...

[Takeshi]
What's happened to you, Sora?


83 :

{T3B087}
[Sora A]
Hmm, what could it be?

She shrugged exaggeratedly.

All three leaned toward me at the same time...


{T3B088}
[Sora B]
Do you think I am strange?


{T3B089}
[Sora C]
Is there something wrong with me?

[Takeshi]
"I'm the one that should be asking that 
question!"

[Takeshi]
What the heck is going on here!?


84 :

{T3B090}
[Sora B]
Heehee~


{T3B091}
[Sora A]
"I don't even know myself anymore what's going 
on..."


{T3B092}
[Sora C]
I feel all happy and fluffy...

She was floating around like someone who was
slightly drunk.

I started to worry.

[Takeshi]
S-Sora! Are you okay?

[Takeshi]
You're sure you're not sick? Or tired?

[Takeshi]
Nothing bad's happened, has it?

[Takeshi]
"Maybe we should get LeMMIH to check you 
out... to make sure there's not some serious 
error..."


{T3B093}
[Sora]
Why, Kuranari-san...!

She pursed her mouth and took a huge sigh.


85 :
Then, suddenly, she appeared right in front of
me in a slightly troubled pose.

She didn't move, and there was only one of her.


{T3B094}
[Sora]
Alright.


{T3B095}
[Sora]
I will stop playing around with you.

[Takeshi]
Playing around...?


86 :

{T3B096}
[Sora]
Yes.


{T3B097}
[Sora]
That was just a little joke...

[Takeshi]
.........


{T3B098}
[Sora]
Now, for the reason I brought you here.

I shook my head, putting my fingers against my
temples.


87 :
Seeing that, Sora smiled at me.

Without making any noise at all, the dolphins
began quietly circling again.


88 :
I leaned against a handy artificial rock with
a mascot pasted to it.

Sora stood at attention once again and began
speaking slowly.


89 :

{T3B099}
[Sora]
"This is the continuation of our conversation 
yesterday."


{T3B100}
[Sora]
"The reason that there is only one being like 
me in the world..."


{T3B101}
[Sora]
"I think I told you that it was the policy of 
my creator."


90 :

{T3B102}
[Sora]
"In order to give me a unified individual 
personality, there are restrictions on my 
faculties."


{T3B103}
[Sora]
"However, theoretically, several of me 
can exist at the same time."


{T3B104}
[Sora]
Just like I showed you before.


91 :

{T3B105}
[Sora]
...Shall I show you again?

[Takeshi]
No thanks. I'm still recovering...


92 :

{T3B106}
[Sora]
Heehee... Alright, I won't do it anymore.

She stopped there.

She seemed to be thinking about something,
then took a deep breath and continued.


93 :

{T3B107}
[Sora]
Just now...


{T3B108}
[Sora]
Could you tell which one was me?

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T3B109}
[Sora]
Which one was me?

[Takeshi]
Well, which... Uh...

[Takeshi]
"So the several versions of you... 
they're all different?"


{T3B110}
[Sora]
No.

[Takeshi]
Well then, they're all the same.

[Takeshi]
They're all the same Sora.


94 :

{T3B111}
[Sora]
Correct.

Sora smiled.


95 :

{T3B112}
[Sora]
Yes, they're all me...


{T3B113}
[Sora]
"Perfect copies... No, perhaps it is easier to 
understand if I use the word 'clones'."


96 :

{T3B114}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, are you aware of the 'Clone Law'
that was officially amended in 2010?"

97 :
{11:0-b2}
{11:1}I know

{11:1}I don't know


98 :
[Takeshi]
Yes, I know of it. In 2010...

[Takeshi]
"Human cloning, which had been illegal up 
until then, was allowed by law."

[Takeshi]
"As long as anyone receives the approval of the 
authorities, they can undergo clone 
fertilization as a way to treat infertility."

[Takeshi]
"The nucleus is taken from an already-
cultivated somatic cell and inserted 
into an egg that has had its original 
nucleus removed."

[Takeshi]
"Then it's implanted into 
the mother's womb..."

[Takeshi]
One of my friend's relatives went through it.


{T3B115}
[Sora]
"Well then, you don't need an explanation 
about cloning."


99 :
[Takeshi]
No, I don't know. I mean... I forget.


{T3B116}
[Sora]
In 2010?


{T3B117}
[Sora]
"Human cloning, which had been illegal up 
until then, was allowed by law."


{T3B118}
[Sora]
"Currently, as long as anyone receives the approval 
of the authorities, they can undergo clone 
fertilization as a way to treat infertility."


{T3B901}
[Sora]
"The nucleus is taken from an already-
cultivated somatic cell and inserted 
into an egg that has had its original 
nucleus removed."

{T3B9019012}
[Sora]
"Then it's implanted into 
the mother's womb..."

[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right, I remember now!

[Takeshi]
One of my friend's relatives went through it.


{T3B120}
[Sora]
Do you understand?


100 :
[Takeshi]
Uh... Uhm... Well...

[Takeshi]
But what does that have to do with this?

[Takeshi]
"Clones develop separately. In other words, 
they're different entities."

[Takeshi]
"They're not the same person. They're more 
like twins..."


{T3B121}
[Sora]
But their source is the same.

She spoke almost casually.


{T3B122}
[Sora]
"Let's go back to what we were talking 
about..."


101 :
Then she branched into her several selves
again.

And she'd said she wouldn't do it anymore...

Sure enough, I was dizzy.


{T3B123}
[Sora]
This 'me', evenly divided...


{T3B124}
[Sora]
...is all 'Akanegasaki Sora'.


{T3B125}
[Sora]
"That 'me' is over there, and at the same 
time, this 'me' is not there."


{T3B126}
[Sora]
"I am here, but the 'me' over there is a 
different 'me'."


{T3B127}
[Sora]
But they are all me, the same 'me'...


{T3B128}
[Sora]
All me.


{T3B129}
[Sora]
Which means...


{T3B130}
[Sora]
I am one, yet at the same time, I am many.


{T3B131}
[Sora]
I can be in any place, exist everywhere.


{T3B132}
[Sora]
I am‡Lomnipresent.


{T3B133}
[Sora]
Yes, that's right.


{T3B134}
[Sora]
"There can be several of me existing in the 
same space at the same time."


{T3B135}
[Sora]
"For example, in front of you and in front of 
£o¢o-chan."


{T3B136}
[Sora]
There and here, there are two of me.


{T3B137}
[Sora]
But they are definitely not 'W'...


{T3B138}
[Sora]
But 'Y'.

[Takeshi]
'Y'?


{T3B139}
[Sora]
"'Y' because we split from our source, 
branching off."

Sora danced around in midair.

Her other images multiplied and disappeared.

It was impossible to even tell their size,
amount, or distance.


{T3B140}
[Sora]
You see... Please think of it this way.


{T3B141}
[Sora]
"What if you could be copied exactly, just 
the way you are?"

[Takeshi]
?

...What was she saying...?


{T3B142}
[Sora]
For instance...


{T3B143}
[Sora]
"For instance, what if every recollection, 
thought, feeling, character trait, 
personality, and emotion that is etched into 
your mind..."


{T3B144}
[Sora]
"In other words, your whole intelligence 
could be perfectly, exactly extracted..."


{T3B145}
[Sora]
"And then duplicated in some kind of 
storage medium, even reproducing all your 
abilities..."


{T3B146}
[Sora]
Then where is the real 'you'?


{T3B147}
[Sora]
"The 'you' who stays in your body, is that the 
real 'you'?"


{T3B148}
[Sora]
Or is the duplicate character, in fact, 'you'?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T3B149}
[Sora]
"The answer is, in any case, that 
the real 'you' does exist in both."


{T3B150}
[Sora]
If such a thing was possible...


{T3B151}
[Sora]
"You would split in a form of non-reductional 
division."


{T3B152}
[Sora]
"In other words, it is not the same as 
splitting an apple into two..."


{T3B153}
[Sora]
"It is as if another apple with the exact same 
mass, shape, and composition comes into being."


{T3B154}
[Sora]
When that happens, you become two.


102 :
Sora got rid of all but one extra body and
stood in front of me.

There were only two copies of Sora before me.

There was no way to tell which was the
original...

103 :
{11:0-b4}
{11:1}Hear more

{11:1}Struggle


104 :
(But why is Sora telling me all this...?)

I wondered, but kept quiet and listened.


105 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
...I...

[Takeshi]
I don't get it.

I wanted to scratch my head.

No, I actually did scratch my head.

[Takeshi]
There's two of me!?

[Takeshi]
What are you saying?

[Takeshi]
Who am I?

[Takeshi]
Who am I!?

[Takeshi]
Is there another me!?

[Takeshi]
If you're out there, answer me!

I wanted to rage, to hit something.

I had to grind my teeth together to keep
myself still.


106 :

{T3B155}
[Sora]
Calm down, Kuranari-san...


{T3B156}
[Sora]
Listen to me...

She arched her eyebrow.


{T3B157}
[Sora]
I'm saying, what if...


107 :

{T3B158}
[Sora]
"If there were such a thing as true cloning, 
not just cellular cloning."


{T3B159}
[Sora]
"If there were a copy that could exist in the 
world with absolutely no difference from the 
original."


{T3B160}
[Sora]
I am simply speaking hypothetically...


108 :

{T3B161}
[Sora]
Please, just listen to me...

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright!

[Takeshi]
Alright. I'll listen.

I took the voice adapter out for a moment,
rubbed my ear, and put it back.

Then I took a deep breath.

[Takeshi]
Haaaaaaaa... hoooooo...

[Takeshi]
Alright, bring it on!

[Sora]
.........


109 :

{T3B162}
[Sora]
Very well, I will continue.


110 :

{T3B163}
[Sora]
Yes... You became two.

The two Soras were speaking in unison.


111 :

{T3B164}
[Sora]
"Historically, and from that moment forward, 
the two of you are traveling down the time 
axis as separate entities."


{T3B165}
[Sora]
"But, if you turn around and look at the 
journey you have taken, you will see that the 
two of you were joined together at one point."


112 :

{T3B166}
[Sora]
"It is split like a 'Y', with two points 
emerging from one line. Not a 'W', with two 
separate points of origin."


113 :

{T3B167}
[Sora]
"You may be unable to imagine two of yourself 
splitting apart and going different ways at a 
particular base point."


{T3B168}
[Sora]
"But that is something that has already 
happened."


114 :

{T3B169}
[Sora]
"You are always, constantly, approaching a 
choice in each present moment that becomes 
the past the instant you visit it."


{T3B170}
[Sora]
"Will you choose path A? Will you choose 
path B?"


{T3B171}
[Sora]
"The 'you' that is standing here may have come 
down path A, but in another time axis, there 
may be a 'you' who is going down path B."


{T3B172}
[Sora]
"And both the 'you' on path A and the 'you' on 
path B are still 'you'."


115 :

{T3B173}
[Sora]
"Except that the 'you' on path A doesn't know 
about the 'you' on path B."


{T3B174}
[Sora]
Because there is no way to know.


{T3B175}
[Sora]
"In the same way, the 'you' on path B 
probably isn't aware of the 'you' on path A 
either."


116 :

{T3B176}
[Sora]
Do you know why that is?


117 :

{T3B176}
[Sora]
Do you?

118 :
{11:0-b6}
{11:1}I don't know

{11:1}I do know


119 :
[Takeshi]
I don't know...

I answered honestly.


{T3B177}
[Sora]
"It is because you only have the ability to 
perceive three dimensions."


{T3B178}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, do I look corporeal to you?

[Takeshi]
Of course.


{T3B179}
[Sora]
"In that case, please take out just one of the 
earphones of your voice adapter and come 
around here to my side."

I carefully removed an earphone and did as
she said.

[Takeshi]
...!?

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora, you...


120 :
Naturally, Sora had become invisible.

[Takeshi]
Where did you go?


{T3B180}
[Sora]
I am here.

[Takeshi]
I can't see you...


{T3B181}
[Sora]
"I haven't moved. And I haven't made myself 
invisible."


{T3B182}
[Sora]
Will you please return to where you were?

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah...

Hesitantly, I moved back toward where I had
been standing.


121 :
Sora's body...

It was like watching something flutter into
an empty space. She slowly came into my line
of vision...

I went back to where I was.

I put the voice adapter back in my ear.


122 :
Sora was standing on both sides of my line of
vision as if nothing had happened at all.


{T3B183}
[Sora]
Now, please close your right eye.

[Takeshi]
Like this?

I closed my right eye.


123 :
The Sora standing on the right side vanished.

Only the Sora standing on the left side was
still there.


{T3B184}
[Sora]
"Next, open your right eye and close your 
left."

I opened my right eye and closed my left...


124 :
That time, the Sora on the left vanished, and
the Sora on the right sprang into view.


{T3B185}
[Sora]
Now, open both your eyes.

[Takeshi]
.........


125 :
Just like before, two Soras stood at either
edge of my vision.


{T3B186}
[Sora]
To 'see' a three-dimensional figure...


{T3B187}
[Sora]
"You take two-dimensional information acquired 
from both of your eyes, and your brain 
analyzes and processes it accordingly to gain 
the correct depth."


{T3B188}
[Sora]
"So to see a three-dimensional space from the 
outside, and be able to recognize it...?"

[Takeshi]
...I don't get it. I don't get it, but...

[Takeshi]
Somehow, I think DO get it.


126 :
[Takeshi]
It's obvious.

I answered.

[Takeshi]
"You just stated that 'there is no way to 
know'."

[Takeshi]
"There is no means in existence to let my 'A' 
self see my 'B' self."

[Takeshi]
"For a person to see a three-dimensional body, 
they have to receive flattened visual 
information from two eyes, and the brain has 
to make sense of it."

[Takeshi]
In the same way...

[Takeshi]
"To know that both 'A' and 'B' of yourself 
exist, you'd have to move to a perspective 
completely outside the 'Y'."

[Takeshi]
"Even if you understand it intellectually, you 
can't actually confirm that 'A' and 'B' both 
exist."


{T3B189}
[Sora]
That's right.


127 :

{T3B190}
[Sora]
"Wonderful... Kuranari-san, you might be a natural 
at this."

[Takeshi]
At what?


{T3B191}
[Sora]
At physics... or perhaps even philosophy.

[Takeshi]
You don't have to flatter me.


128 :
Sora held her hand up in the air.

I could see a holograph...


129 :
A board appeared in midair and neatly folded
itself into a square.

A point of light appeared and started
moving.


{T3B192}
[Sora]
"Let's say that there are intelligent beings 
in a two-dimensional world."


{T3B193}
[Sora]
Can they see a three-dimensional object?


130 :

{T3B194}
[Sora]
No, they cannot.

The square changed into a cube.


{T3B195}
[Sora]
"The reason is that since they only exist in two 
dimensions, they can only perceive those 
things which happen on a plane."


{T3B196}
[Sora]
"In a two-dimensional field of vision, only 
straight lines (one dimension) can be 
reflected."

The dots of light appeared on all six faces
of the cube.

But each light only moved around the surface
of its own square, never intersecting with
the other lights.


131 :

{T3B197}
[Sora]
"Now then, let's say that for some reason they 
become three-dimensional."


{T3B198}
[Sora]
"Then, in their three-dimensional range of 
vision, only planes (two dimensions) can be 
reflected."


132 :
The lights from the six surfaces gathered
together to become one and moved to the
center of the cube.


133 :
And in every direction, new holograms of cubes
appeared.

The cubes lined up surface to surface,
without even a crevice between them.


{T3B199}
[Sora]
"With three-dimensional sight, all that happens 
is that the plane reflected in the right eye 
and the plane reflected in the left eye are 
synthesized into one image."


{T3B200}
[Sora]
"It would be impossible to achieve something 
close to the real image of Mount Fuji, for 
example, even with a finely-drawn backdrop."

A light floated in each of the cubes.


The lights moved incessantly, vigorously
colliding into the six faces of the cubes and
moving.

But each light never left its cube and never
intersected with any of the other lights.


{T3B201}
[Sora]
Shall we go over it again?


{T3B202}
[Sora]
"By combining two-dimensional information 
coming in at the same time from two different 
sources, you are really just hallucinating 
that you are perceiving a solid form."


{T3B203}
[Sora]
That is not true three-dimensional vision.


{T3B204}
[Sora]
"Three-dimensional vision is when you can see all 
six sides of a cube at the same time."


{T3B205}
[Sora]
"In an 'n' dimension, you can only obtain 
visual information in the dimension of 'n-1'."


{T3B206}
[Sora]
"This is why if you are on one tip of the 'Y' 
shape, it means that you cannot be aware of 
what is happening at the other tip."


{T3B207}
[Sora]
"Let's say that you did obtain a three-dimensional 
range of vision..."


{T3B208}
[Sora]
"So if you escaped the plane of 
two-dimensionality and looked 'down' 
from a three-dimensional space at the 
two-dimensional plane..."


{T3B209}
[Sora]
"You would realize for the first time that 
you were at a particular point on the 'Y'..."


{T3B210}
[Sora]
"And realize, too, that there is another 
'you' who took a different branch of the 'Y'."

[Takeshi]
.........


134 :
The holographic cubes broke apart and then
disappeared.


135 :
Suddenly, my field of vision was filled with a
dazzling white light.

Sora looked distorted.

She split into countless versions of
herself.

I couldn't see anything but Soras.


136 :
I couldn't stand to hold my eyes open.

Which one was she?

Was she all of them...?


{T3B211}
[Sora]
"You see, it's the same for a three-dimensional 
space..."


{T3B212}
[Sora]
When you acquire four-dimensional vision.


{T3B213}
[Sora]
"In other words, if you escape this 
third-dimensional space and look 'down' at it 
from a fourth-dimensional space..."


{T3B214}
[Sora]
"You will realize for the first time that you 
were on one point of the 'Y'..."


{T3B215}
[Sora]
"And realize too that there is another 'you' 
who took a different branch of the 'Y'."

[Takeshi]
.........


{T3B216}
[Sora]
"In a different history, in a different 
world, in a different place..."


{T3B217}
[Sora]
"...Another 'you' exists. Do you understand 
this?"


{T3B218}
[Sora]
You are omnipresent in the world.


{T3B219}
[Sora]
And in the same way, so am I.


{T3B220}
[Sora]
You and I...


{T3B221}
[Sora]
We are just branches of the 'Y'...


{T3B222}
[Sora]
However...


{T3B223}
[Sora]
These divided selves can become one...


137 :
Sora stopped dividing herself.

The brightness faded and then was gone.

The single Sora quietly fluttered down to
stand before me.

The dolphins behind us had stopped their
revolutions at some point.


138 :

{T3B224}
[Sora]
"If the self you don't know were to become 
inseparably bound with you..."


{T3B225}
[Sora]
"If you could stand in a place where you 
could see and understand all the others that 
were 'you'..."


{T3B226}
[Sora]
"Then all the experiences of your other selves 
would become like your own experiences."


{T3B227}
[Sora]
In the truest sense, you would become one.

[Takeshi]
.........

I let out a long sigh.

[Takeshi]
Listen...

[Takeshi]
Can I ask you just one thing?


139 :

{T3B228}
[Sora]
Please do.

[Takeshi]
Why are you telling me all of this...?


140 :

{T3B229}
[Sora]
Hmm... That's a good question...

Sora turned in a full circle right where she
was and smiled.


141 :

{T3B230}
[Sora]
It is a legend.


{T3B231}
[Sora]
"It is a legend passed down through the Lemurian
continent... and is the origin behind LeMU."


{T3B232}
[Sora]
Let's just leave it at that.


142 :

{T3B233}
[Sora]
...And you must understand, it is a secret.

Sora held up one finger in front of her mouth and
smiled once again.
