1 :
We finished making our rounds.

The Kid had gone back into the examination room
with Y¤u and £o¢o earlier.


2 :
Tsugumi and I were talking in the corridor.


[Takeshi]
Looks like we don't have any options...


{T6T000}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...


3 :

{T6T001}
[Tsugumi]
So what do you want to do?

[Takeshi]
What do I...? Um, I'm thinking about it.


4 :

{T6T002}
[Tsugumi]
Really...

Tsugumi smiled slightly.


{T6T003}
[Tsugumi]
"You really like to waste your time, don't you, 
Takeshi?"

[Takeshi]
Th-this isn't wasting time.


5 :

{T6T004}
[Tsugumi]
Haha, sorry... but...


6 :

{T6T005}
[Tsugumi]
But it seems just like something you'd do.

[Takeshi]
Thinking about things that are impossible?


7 :
When I said that, Tsugumi puffed up her cheeks.


{T6T006}
[Tsugumi]
No...! I don't mean that.


{T6T007}
[Tsugumi]
Why do you have to tease me...?

[Takeshi]
I never thought I'd hear YOU say that.


8 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
I have no idea what to do, but...

[Takeshi]
"We'll find a way out of this somehow. We've 
made it this far."

Tsugumi laughed at my efforts to sound
positive.


9 :

{T6T008}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... I'm sure we'll be 'fine'.

[Takeshi]
Sure... It's gonna be alright.


10 :
A sound roared in the distance. It was
probably being transmitted through the water
to IBF, where we were.

Was it... the sound of the thermal vents?


I wondered if LeMU was still hanging in there...

Although the situation we were in didn't look
great, there were still various options
available to us.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi... About that old guy...


11 :

{T6T009}
[Tsugumi]
The researcher? Too bad, huh...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. But I was thinking, why was he the 
only one left here? Everyone else got out 
earlier, right?"

[Takeshi]
Well, besides those guys that didn't make it...


12 :

{T6T010}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm sure some kind of circumstances kept him 
from escaping. And circumstances that kept him 
alive..."

[Takeshi]
Circumstances?


{T6T011}
[Tsugumi]
"Do you remember the entry logs we found on 
the terminals?"

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, there were a few of them... Ah? Wait, 
are you saying...!?"


{T6T012}
[Tsugumi]
You remember? That journal entry we found.

[Takeshi]
Oh, it was him...

His last words had been, 'Take care of my
daughter.'


13 :

{T6T013}
[Tsugumi]
I think that was £o¢o's dad.

[Takeshi]
"T.Y.... Doctor Yagami, huh? He probably knew 
that £o¢o was here when the accident hit LeMU."


14 :

{T6T014}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, I'm sure... he did.


{T6T015}
[Tsugumi]
"Maybe he survived because he was thinking 
about his daughter."


15 :
Leaning against the wall, we watched the waves
that calmly lapped in the pool.


16 :
[Takeshi]
What do you think about £o¢o's condition?

[Takeshi]
Why did £o¢o get TB anyway...?


17 :

{T6T016}
[Tsugumi]
"Well... £o¢o had been to IBF at least once 
before May 1st."


{T6T017}
[Tsugumi]
"Maybe there was already an outbreak of the 
TB virus at that time."

[Takeshi]
What?


18 :

{T6T018}
[Tsugumi]
"TB's incubation period is two to seven 
days... That's consistent with the timing of 
£o¢o's symptoms, isn't it?"

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah... I guess you're right.

[Takeshi]
"When £o¢o came to IBF, she was probably 
exposed to TB somehow..."

Nodding to myself, I figured that had to be
the most probable possibility.


19 :

{T6T019}
[Tsugumi]
"However, everyone at IBF probably didn't 
realize the terrible truth that TB was 
spreading inside the installation."


{T6T020}
[Tsugumi]
"When they found that a few people had become 
infected, they must have panicked... and the 
situation got out of hand."


20 :

{T6T021}
[Tsugumi]
"As people started dying, the staff here 
tried to escape, and when the escape pods ran 
out..."

[Takeshi]
W-wait! That means...!

[Takeshi]
That alarm meant...

[Takeshi]
"The alarm that we heard on May 1st in Lemu 
was...!?"

I couldn't stop myself from asking. Tsugumi
frowned and continued.


21 :

{T6T022}
[Tsugumi]
"Probably one of the terrified staff members 
forced their way up from IBF to LeMU..."


{T6T023}
[Tsugumi]
"Without following the standard decompression 
procedure, they opened the emergency 
corridors and fled up to Insel Null."


22 :

{T6T024}
[Tsugumi]
Those corridors remained open for a while.

[Takeshi]
"And the built-up gas inside the complex 
quickly escaped, which brought down the pressure, 
a section of LeMU started flooding, and the 
watertight doors closed."

[Takeshi]
"And that's how we ended up getting stuck 
here...?"


23 :

{T6T025}
[Tsugumi]
Yup, that's right.


{T6T026}
[Tsugumi]
Meaning the alarm that went off in LeMU...


{T6T027}
[Tsugumi]
"Was for the abnormal installation pressure 
readings and the virus outbreak‡Lyou could 
say it served a couple of functions."

[Takeshi]
I can't believe it...!

All I could do was sigh in frustration.

[Takeshi]
"That's the reason that no rescue team is 
coming here...?"


24 :

{T6T028}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sure that's it.

With a solemn face, Tsugumi nodded.


{T6T029}
[Tsugumi]
"If the TB virus got out to the world 
outside, it would be devastating."


{T6T030}
[Tsugumi]
"So, even if there were survivors in here, it 
would be necessary to lock them up at the 
bottom of the ocean."


25 :

{T6T031}
[Tsugumi]
"Leiblich Pharmaceuticals may even be trying 
to hide the fact that there was an accident 
at all."


{T6T032}
[Tsugumi]
"Knowing all the while that we're trapped in 
here..."

[Takeshi]
.........


26 :
I kicked a dirty old bottle that was at my 
feet

It landed in the pool and 
slowly sunk.


27 :
Then I walked around, making stomping sounds
as I went.

The sounds of our feet echoed loudly off the
walls of the narrow corridor.

[Takeshi]
Well, if that's the case, then...


28 :

{T6T033}
[Tsugumi]
Then?

[Takeshi]
Well, you know?

[Takeshi]
"That means we've got to get ourselves back 
up to the surface no matter what!"


29 :

{T6T034}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm, why's that?

[Takeshi]
"So that we can tell the media all about 
what's happened here, that's why!"

[Takeshi]
We're going to put it to Leiblich!

[Takeshi]
No matter what, okay?


30 :

{T6T035}
[Tsugumi]
Okay.


31 :

{T6T036}
[Tsugumi]
"Heh heh... That's more like the Takeshi I 
know."

Puffing out her cheeks slightly, Tsugumi
looked at me.

[Takeshi]
Really?


{T6T037}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, me too...


32 :

{T6T038}
[Tsugumi]
I want to go with you, Takeshi... Together...

[Takeshi]
Huh? Did you say something?


33 :

{T6T039}
[Tsugumi]
I-it's nothing.

For some reason, Tsugumi's face was red.


34 :
[Takeshi]
Huh...?

I felt strange and suddenly stopped.

I looked up.


35 :

{T6T040}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... What's wrong?

Tsugumi followed my gaze to the ceiling.

There was nothing there.

She returned her gaze to me.

[Takeshi]
Uh...

[Takeshi]
I'm not really sure, but...

[Takeshi]
"For some reason, it's hard to breathe all of a 
sudden..."


36 :

{T6T041}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...?


{T6T042}
[Tsugumi]
Your... nose is bleeding...

[Takeshi]
?


37 :

{T6T043}
[Tsugumi]
You've got a nosebleed.

[Takeshi]
Eh?

I quickly put my hand to my nose.

My upper lip was wet with something.


38 :

{T6T044}
[Tsugumi]
He-hey? Are you okay?

Tsugumi looked worriedly at my face.

[Takeshi]
I-it's fine, it's fine...

I looked up and wiped under my nose as I
replied.

[Takeshi]
"I wasn't thinking anything sexual! 
Absolutely! Positively!"


39 :

{T6T045}
[Tsugumi]
I-it's not like I... I don't care about that!

[Takeshi]
Well, alright then...

My nose wouldn't stop bleeding.

[Takeshi]
Aaah, I look like such a dork.


{T6T046}
[Tsugumi]
Who cares what you look like?

[Takeshi]
"I care. Looking like this in front of you, 
I... uugh..."


40 :

{T6T047}
[Tsugumi]
Huuuh?


{T6T048}
[Tsugumi]
Huuuuh, what?


{T6T049}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, what...?

Tsugumi started shaking my shoulder.


41 :
[Takeshi]
Wuuuuaaaachoooo!

I let out a huge sneeze.


42 :
SPLAT!

43 :



44 :
Blood flew not only from my nose, but also
from my mouth in large amounts.

It splattered all over the floor and onto the wall.


45 :
[Takeshi]
Woooah...!?

I was suddenly assaulted by dizziness.

The world felt like it was spinning.

[Takeshi]
For some reason, I can't keep steady...

Although I didn't feel so great, it seemed
funny for some reason, and I laughed.

[Takeshi]
Ahahaha... What's with this?


46 :

{T6T050}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi!


{T6T051}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, hang in there!

[Takeshi]
"Huh... Quit shaking me, it's making me feel 
sick."


47 :

{T6T052}
[Tsugumi]
S-sorry...

[Takeshi]
N-no, I'm fine. Don't worry, Tsugumi...


48 :

{T6T053}
[Tsugumi]
You're not fine at all!


{T6T054}
[Tsugumi]
You're bleeding all over, Takeshi!


49 :

{T6T055}
[Tsugumi]
"We need to get you to the examination room 
and get you looked at right away."

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah... *Cough*...


50 :
It wasn't a good situation...

I needed to get a hold of myself...

I tried to calm myself down.

With Tsugumi supporting me, I walked down the
corridor.

Just then, a door flew open in front of us.

It was the examination room. Out of it flew
Y¤u.


51 :

{T6T056}
[Y¤u]
"Tsugumi, Kuranari! The Kid! The Kid's in bad 
shape!"

Her face changed color as she shouted.


{T6T057}
[Tsugumi]
The Kid? What's wrong?


{T6T058}
[Y¤u]
"He's in trouble! It'll be faster if you come 
in and look... ah!"


52 :

{T6T059}
[Y¤u]
No... Kuranari, you too!?

Y¤u noticed the shape I was in, and her face
turned pale.


{T6T060}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi 'too'?

[Takeshi]
What are you talking about...?


53 :
The Kid was sleeping on the L-MRI table.

His results from the scan came up on the
control panel's monitor.

'Tief Blau 2017-Rev.17'


54 :

{T6T061}
[Y¤u]
"The Kid's been infected with Tief Blau 
too..."


55 :
[Takeshi]
How could that happen!?

[Takeshi]
"Why? He's been with us the whole time. So 
why did he get...?"

[Takeshi]
Why and where did he get TB...!? *Cough*...

I mumbled to myself, finding it hard to
breathe all of a sudden.


56 :

{T6T062}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, just calm down...


{T6T063}
[Tsugumi]
None of us know where he got exposed to it.

[Takeshi]
.........


57 :

{T6T064}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, I want you to get scanned too.

[Takeshi]
Wh-why!?


58 :

{T6T065}
[Tsugumi]
Just let me scan you... please.


{T6T066}
[Tsugumi]
"It isn't normal to start spewing blood from 
your nose and mouth, okay?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I know... but...


59 :
Tsugumi gently took the Kid off of the L-MRI
examination table and forcefully put me up on
it.

Pressing on both of my shoulders, she forced
me down on the table.

[Takeshi]
"Y-you don't have to do that... Fine, I'll let 
you check me."

I brushed Tsugumi's hands off of me.

[Takeshi]
See? I'm lying down now.


60 :

{T6T067}
[Tsugumi]
Okay... Y¤u, please start the scan.


{T6T068}
[Y¤u]
O-okay.


61 :
Y¤u started operating the control panel.


62 :
The scanning light from the laser crawled
slowly up my body.

After a while...


63 :

{T6T069}
[Y¤u]
The scan's finished...

[Takeshi]
Wh-what's it say?

My voice cracked when I asked the question.


64 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
A-at least say something, Y¤u.


{T6T070}
[Y¤u]
The results are...

Y¤u stared at the panel without moving.


65 :

{T6T071}
[Tsugumi]
"The result is positive... You're infected 
too, Takeshi."

Tsugumi read the monitor for me.

[Takeshi]
...! R-really...?


{T6T072}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sorry to say it, but...


66 :

{T6T073}
[Tsugumi]
"Since coming to IBF... No, it must've been 
longer, since coming to LeMU... All of us..."


{T6T074}
[Tsugumi]
Have been infected for quite some time.

Tsugumi hung her head and let out a big sigh.



67 :
[Takeshi]
Damn it...

I stood up from the L-MRI and was assaulted
by a terrible dizzy spell.


68 :
[Takeshi]
Whooaaah...


69 :

{T6T075}
[Kid]
Takeshi, watch out...!

The one to steady me from falling was the Kid.


70 :
But from the looks of it, his legs weren't
very steady either.

Putting my hand on a wall, I somehow held
myself up.


{T6T076}
[Kid]
We're in trouble, huh...?

[Takeshi]
Y-you can say that again...


71 :

{T6T077}
[Kid]
"If only we had that serum... The orange 
one... agh."

The Kid pressed his hand to his face.

As he wiped his mouth, I noticed a thin trail
of blood there.

[Takeshi]
"Y-yeah, the serum... If they've been 
handling TB here at IBF, they should have 
some of that."

[Takeshi]
"If we use that, then the symptoms should 
lessen..."


72 :
I went around the examination room and
checked to see if I could find it anywhere.


73 :
Tsugumi and Y¤u hurriedly started checking
through the medicine cabinets.


74 :
The Kid sank to the floor. He didn't look
very good.

His breathing was ragged. He had lines of pain
etched on his face.


75 :

{T6T078}
[Y¤u]
"It's no good. It doesn't look like there's 
any here."


{T6T079}
[Tsugumi]
I can't find any either.

The two of them were shaking their heads.

[Takeshi]
Damn... What are we gonna do?

[Y¤u]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!


76 :
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Pipi, you seem like you're doing pretty 
well."

Without me noticing, Pipi had come up and was
darting around my legs.

His tail was wagging frantically.


77 :
He suddenly dropped a few small objects from
his mouth.

[Takeshi]
!?


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!

[Takeshi]
H-hey! Where'd you get...?


{T6T080}
[Y¤u]
What's wrong...? Ah!

Y¤u ran over to where we were.


{T6T081}
[Y¤u]
This is... the orange serum.

She picked up one of the fallen objects in
front of Pipi.

It was a small capsule‡La capsule with orange
liquid inside of it.

Four of them had fallen on the floor.

[Takeshi]
Where'd you find that, Pipi?

I didn't know if he'd understand me, but I
asked Pipi anyway.


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whine*...

Pipi shook his head from side to side.

[Takeshi]
Were there any more of these?


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whiiiine*...

He shook his head.

[Takeshi]
This is... all of them?


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

He nodded.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
W-well, we need to take these immediately...


78 :
[Takeshi]
"Sorry, Y¤u, but get these ready. You're the 
only one who knows how to give shots."


{T6T082}
[Tsugumi]
I found some syringes over here, Y¤u.


{T6T083}
[Y¤u]
O-okay!


79 :
We gathered all of the cartridges of serum
from the floor and put them on the bed.

Looking slightly doubtful, Y¤u prepared the
syringes one at a time and gave the Kid and
me our shots.


80 :
[Takeshi]
Phew... We can relax for a while now.


{T6T084}
[Kid]
Thanks, Y¤u...


{T6T085}
[Y¤u]
You're welcome.


81 :
Sitting with his back against the wall, the
Kid gave Y¤u a thumbs up.

After that, he smiled and closed his eyes. He
must have fallen asleep.

Tsugumi and I carried the Kid over to an
empty bed.

[Takeshi]
What do we do about £o¢o?


82 :

{T6T086}
[Tsugumi]
"She's still undergoing the oxygen treatment. 
So we can't open the pod."


{T6T087}
[Tsugumi]
"It looks like the treatment is progressing 
normally. As long as she's in there, I don't 
think her condition will get much worse..."


{T6T088}
[Tsugumi]
"As soon as it's done, let's give £o¢o a 
shot too."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, okay...

[Y¤u]
.........


83 :
[Takeshi]
"Oh yeah, you should probably give yourself a 
shot too, don't you think, Y¤u?"


84 :

{T6T089}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Um, no, I...

[Y¤u]
.........

The next shot had already been prepared, but
for some reason, Y¤u was stalling.


85 :

{T6T090}
[Y¤u]
*Cough*... *cough*!

Suddenly, she started coughing.

[Takeshi]
Hey! Give yourself a shot, quickly!


{T6T091}
[Y¤u]
But, I-I just...*cough*

She wouldn't stop coughing.

Her arm that held the syringe started to shake.



86 :

{T6T092}
[Y¤u]
Breathe deep... fuuu... haaa...

Her coughing finally stopped.

But her hands wouldn't go still.

[Takeshi]
"Wh-what's wrong? You aren't feeling well? You 
want me to give the shot to you?"


87 :

{T6T093}
[Y¤u]
Huh, n-no way...


{T6T094}
[Y¤u]
I... I don't like shots...

[Takeshi]
Huh!?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"You didn't have any problem sticking everyone 
else!"


{T6T095}
[Tsugumi]
You don't like getting them yourself?


88 :

{T6T096}
[Y¤u]
Well yeah. 'Cause they hurt!

Y¤u puffed out her cheeks stubbornly.

[Takeshi]
"What are you talking about!? Your life's on 
the line here...!"

[Takeshi]
You don't have a choice, so give me the syringe!


89 :

{T6T097}
[Y¤u]
Aagh!


90 :
Reaching out quickly, I latched onto Y¤u's arm.


[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, hold her down!


91 :

{T6T098}
[Tsugumi]
Roger.


92 :
Tsugumi forced Y¤u to sit on the bed and
held her so that she couldn't move.


{T6T099}
[Y¤u]
Hey... *cough*, what are you doing!? Ouch!

[Takeshi]
Stop complaining!

I grabbed onto Y¤u's arm and stuck the
needle in it.


{T6T100}
[Y¤u]
Hey! Where do you think you're sticking that!?


{T6T101}
[Y¤u]
"You've got it all wrong! Not there! Aaaa, 
stop mangling me!"


{T6T102}
[Y¤u]
Ow! Ouch! Stop! Go more slowly!

[Takeshi]
Well, stop squirming around so much!


{T6T103}
[Y¤u]
The angle's all wrong!


{T6T104}
[Y¤u]
You're going to get air bubbles in it!

[Takeshi]
Stop complaining! You can't do it yourself!


{T6T105}
[Y¤u]
You suck!

[Takeshi]
Shut up!


{T6T106}
[Y¤u]
"Stop iiiit! Lemmee goooo! I'm dyyyinnnng! 
Oooooowwwch!"

[Takeshi]
"You idiot! We're giving you this so you WON'T 
die!"


{T6T107}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh...*

Tsugumi slumped her shoulders.

Y¤u was throwing a tantrum like a spoiled
child.

Small droplets of red stained the white
sheets of the bed.

.........

......


93 :
After that, Y¤u got scanned on the L-MRI. As
suspected, she had come down with TB.

We didn't have room to mess around anymore.

In the end, Y¤u wouldn't let me do it, so she
ended up giving herself the shot.

Complaining the whole time with tears in
her eyes...


94 :
[Takeshi]
"I'm not sure how long our condition will 
hold with just one shot..."

[Takeshi]
"Hey, Y¤u? Do you think we can do anything 
after it stops working?"

[Y¤u]
.........

She was sitting at the computer terminal,
silently typing on the keyboard.

[Takeshi]
Y¤u, tell me what we can expect?


95 :

{T6T108}
[Y¤u]
Don't talk to me, I can't concentrate.

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright.


96 :

{T6T109}
[Y¤u]
I'm trying my best...


{T6T110}
[Y¤u]
"But someone has put a lock on the 
communications protocol, and we can't make 
contact with the surface."


{T6T111}
[Y¤u]
"But every once in a while, I've found some 
communication data that crosses through."


{T6T112}
[Y¤u]
"If I can release that lock, or... Well, 
anyway, we just might be able to get through 
somehow."


97 :

{T6T113}
[Y¤u]
"At least it's better than LeMU, where we 
had no way of making contact."

[Takeshi]
Alright, show me what you got, genius!


{T6T114}
[Y¤u]
Okay...


98 :
I left Y¤u for a while and went to look at
the monitor attached to the capsule pod.

Tsugumi came over to stand next to me and
looked at the monitor.


99 :

{T6T115}
[Tsugumi]
How is £o¢o doing?

[Takeshi]
She's in 'serious but stable' condition.


{T6T116}
[Tsugumi]
Really...

According to the monitor, it would be four
hours before £o¢o could leave the pod.

The pod was full of high-pressure oxygen.

We couldn't take £o¢o out of there until the
time had come.


100 :

{T6T117}
[Tsugumi]
"We should probably get the Kid into a pod, 
don't you think?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah... let's get it ready.


101 :
But for some reason, we couldn't get the hatch
on the furthest pod to close.

It wasn't easy, but... I took the dead
researcher out of his pod and set him down
outside.

Doctor T.Y....

He was dead.

He had looked like he was smiling at the very
end, but...

His expression had betrayed his agony after
all.

It was probably best that £o¢o hadn't seen her
father's dead face.

Tsugumi sterilized the pod and finished
cleaning up.

I shook awake the Kid, who was sleeping in
the bed.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid, the pod's ready. Wake up...


102 :

{T6T118}
[Kid]
Unh... Takeshi?

He slowly opened his eyes.

[Takeshi]
"Sorry to wake you, Kid, but I need you to 
get in the capsule pod."


103 :

{T6T119}
[Kid]
Wha...

He opened his eyes wide at my words.


104 :

{T6T120}
[Kid]
What about... everyone else?

[Takeshi]
"There's only one pod that we can really use. 
So you get in."


105 :

{T6T121}
[Kid]
No... No way!

[Takeshi]
What!?


{T6T122}
[Kid]
"Forget it, why should I be the only one 
to... I can't just abandon everyone!"

[Takeshi]
"It's not like that, it's about how sick you 
are. You're the most serious case after £o¢o."


106 :
[Kid]
.........


107 :

{T6T123}
[Kid]
Still, forget it.


{T6T124}
[Kid]
"Once I get in the pod, I can't get out for a 
while, right?"


108 :

{T6T125}
[Kid]
No way... I... I want to stay by £o¢o!


109 :
Getting up out of bed, the Kid staggered
quickly over to £o¢o's pod.


110 :

{T6T126}
[Kid]
"I'm not moving from here until we know that 
everyone's getting out!"


111 :
He clung to the pod.

I thought about trying to pull him off, but
he seemed absolutely determined not to move.

[Takeshi]
"You stupid brat! What the hell are you 
saying?"

Forgetting my own exhaustion, I began
shouting at the Kid.

[Takeshi]
"Don't you want to escape? If you want to 
get out, you have to listen to me!"

[Takeshi]
If you get any worse...

[Takeshi]
"Even if you get in the pod, it might be too 
late!"


{T6T127}
[Kid]
But... But... *cough*...

[Takeshi]
"Listen, there's only one more shot of the 
serum left!"

I pointed to the orange capsule left on the
empty bed.

[Takeshi]
So! So... so...


112 :
[Takeshi]
What!?

[Takeshi]
Wait, why is there one left?

All of a sudden, the questions flew.


113 :

{T6T128}
[Kid]
Hey!


114 :

{T6T129}
[Y¤u]
What?

Y¤u turned away from the terminal as well.


115 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


116 :

{T6T130}
[Tsugumi]
What are you talking about...?


117 :

{T6T131}
[Tsugumi]
That cartridge is for £o¢o, right?

Tsugumi mumbled with her face slightly turned
away.


118 :
[Y¤u]
.........


119 :

{T6T132}
[Y¤u]
So that's it...


120 :
Everyone's gazes finally rested on Tsugumi.


121 :

{T6T133}
[Y¤u]
"You know, Tsugumi... I still haven't given 
you an injection."

[Tsugumi]
.........


122 :

{T6T134}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah? So?

Tsugumi mumbled with her eyes averted.


123 :

{T6T135}
[Y¤u]
"I had forgotten before. I injected Kuranari
and the Kid with a shot. Then I got busy, and 
then..."

[Tsugumi]
.........


124 :

{T6T136}
[Y¤u]
"So out of four of the shots, we still have 
one left."

Getting up from the terminal, Y¤u spoke acidly.


125 :

{T6T137}
[Y¤u]
How you feeling, Tsugumi?

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T6T138}
[Y¤u]
You're not in pain?

[Tsugumi]
.........

Come to think of it, Tsugumi didn't have any
symptoms.

She didn't show any signs of the TB virus.

I dredged up Tsugumi's old words from the
depths of my memory...

'Highly improved immune system and
increased metabolic efficiency'.

'Telomeres that continue to rejuvenate'.

.........

(It couldn't be...)


126 :

{T6T139}
[Y¤u]
"Tsugumi, I want you to get scanned right 
now."

[Tsugumi]
.........


127 :
'Curé Virus-P-Carrier'

Tsugumi's genetic makeup had been altered by
Curé, giving her incredible regenerative
powers against illness and injuries.

Tsugumi had also been infected with TB, but
she'd already been able to make the
antibodies and drive out the virus.

Curé...

Tsugumi had gone beyond the normal human
capability...

She had mentioned that she was 'special'.

Successful cases of genetic manipulation were
probably exceedingly rare.


128 :

{T6T140}
[Y¤u]
Curé...

Looking at the results from the L-MRI scan,
Y¤u nodded.


{T6T141}
[Y¤u]
"I found it in LeMU's database... but I'd 
heard about it once before..."


{T6T142}
[Y¤u]
"I never would have imagined you're a carrier 
of the Curé virus, Tsugumi."


129 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


130 :

{T6T143}
[Tsugumi]
I don't care if you hate me.


{T6T144}
[Y¤u]
Hate you? Why would I?


131 :

{T6T145}
[Tsugumi]
Well then, are you scared?


{T6T146}
[Tsugumi]
You're scared of me, aren't you, Y¤u?


{T6T147}
[Tsugumi]
"You're probably thinking that you don't want 
anything more to do with me, right?"


{T6T148}
[Y¤u]
I-I wouldn't think that...!

Y¤u shook her head fiercely.


132 :

{T6T149}
[Y¤u]
Why...


{T6T150}
[Y¤u]
Why would you say that?


{T6T151}
[Tsugumi]
Well...

Tsugumi bit her lips and said...


133 :

{T6T152}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, because I can be here... and I don't 
have to suffer."


{T6T153}
[Tsugumi]
"It could be that I'll just watch all of you throw 
up blood, and eventually, when you're crawling 
on the floor, I'll be laughing at you."


134 :

{T6T154}
[Tsugumi]
Because I'm just a cruel person like that...


135 :
[Y¤u]
.........


136 :
Y¤u couldn't look Tsugumi in the eyes.


137 :

{T6T155}
[Kid]
I don't think that you're like that.

Clutching £o¢o's pod, the Kid spoke up.


138 :

{T6T156}
[Kid]
"I don't think you're a bad person at all. I 
mean..."


139 :

{T6T157}
[Kid]
You're the one who saved £o¢o, right?


{T6T158}
[Kid]
You risked your life to save someone.


140 :

{T6T159}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, so what...?


141 :

{T6T160}
[Tsugumi]
To tell you the truth, I regret it now.


{T6T161}
[Tsugumi]
£o¢o is suffering from TB now, isn't she?


142 :

{T6T162}
[Tsugumi]
"She's stuck in that pod, and she's 
suffering..."


{T6T163}
[Tsugumi]
"If I hadn't had the stupid whim to do 
that... this wouldn't be happening right now."


143 :
[Kid]
.........

The Kid turned away from Tsugumi.


144 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
Stop it right now!

I yelled at her with all of my might.

I ran over to her and grabbed her by her
collar.


145 :
[Takeshi]
Are you still talking garbage like that!?

[Takeshi]
Saying things you don't really mean!?


{T6T164}
[Tsugumi]
I... mean it.

[Takeshi]
Stop lying to yourself!


146 :

{T6T165}
[Tsugumi]
It isn't... a lie.


{T6T166}
[Tsugumi]
I...


147 :

{T6T167}
[Tsugumi]
"It's the truth... The only one who TB isn't 
affecting is me."

[Takeshi]
...Ha...


148 :
I let go of Tsugumi.


149 :

{T6T168}
[Tsugumi]
"So how about it, Takeshi? Are you ready to 
accept the truth now...?"

Tsugumi‡Lprobably just pretending‡Lsmiled
and looked at me.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, it is an indisputable fact.

[Takeshi]
Fine. I'll accept it.

[Takeshi]
BUT...


150 :
[Takeshi]
You might just help us get better.


151 :

{T6T169}
[Tsugumi]
What did you say?

Just then, Tsugumi's expression became serious.


152 :
[Takeshi]
"Well, I'm not a doctor, so I can't really 
tell, but..."

[Takeshi]
Smallpox, penicillin, snake antivenom...

[Takeshi]
"You're pretty smart, so this should make sense 
to you, right?"


153 :

{T6T170}
[Tsugumi]
N-no way.

[Takeshi]
It's our only chance.

[Takeshi]
"Your body is creating antibodies to the 
Tief Blau virus, so we'll use that."

[Takeshi]
"If we can get those antibodies, then there's 
a small chance we can fight off the Tief Blau."


154 :

{T6T171}
[Tsugumi]
It's too dangerous!

Tsugumi's expression was getting more and more
worked up.


{T6T172}
[Tsugumi]
"Do you have any idea how hard it is to 
make antibodies and vaccines that work!?"


155 :

{T6T173}
[Tsugumi]
There's almost no chance!


{T6T174}
[Tsugumi]
"If you make even the slightest mistake, it 
could kill all of you!"

[Takeshi]
If we don't do anything, we're dead anyway!


156 :

{T6T175}
[Tsugumi]
......!

She sucked in her breath.

Without moving, Tsugumi's expression turned to
ice.


157 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

Y¤u and the Kid, who had been staring at the
ground the whole time, raised their heads and
looked at me.


158 :
[Takeshi]
"That's right... If we don't do anything, we're 
dead."

[Takeshi]
And if that's the case...

[Takeshi]
"It's better that we take this risk, no 
matter how small our chance of survival."

[Takeshi]
...*Cough*...


159 :
Splash.

160 :



161 :
[Takeshi]
Damn it, not another nosebleed...

[Takeshi]
A nosebleed AND I'm coughing up blood...

[Takeshi]
I can't believe how lame this is...

I wiped off my nose and my chin.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"What? You aren't going to laugh at me 
for being such a dork, Tsugumi?"


162 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Come on, laugh, Tsugumi.


163 :
I held out my hand toward her.

It was covered in blood.


164 :

{T6T176}
[Tsugumi]
Stop it. Stay away from me...


{T6T177}
[Tsugumi]
Stop... I don't want to...

Shaking her head fiercely, Tsugumi backed away.


165 :

{T6T178}
[Y¤u]
Ku-Kuranari...

[Takeshi]
Sh...!

Y¤u was moving to stand up, but I lifted a
hand, signaling her to stop.


166 :

{T6T179}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kuranari, Tsugumi...

Y¤u opened her mouth to talk from where she
was seated at the terminal.


{T6T180}
[Y¤u]
"There's a simple lab in the back of the 
examination room."


{T6T181}
[Y¤u]
"I saw a centrifuge and a machine for refining 
serum..."


167 :

{T6T182}
[Y¤u]
"We could probably use that to safely and 
quickly extract the Tief Blau antibodies."


{T6T183}
[Y¤u]
"If this can scan for Tief Blau, it can 
probably scan for the antibodies and extract 
them."

She continued to talk in a low, calm voice.


168 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, please help us. I'm asking you.


{T6T184}
[Tsugumi]
Stay away from me, Takeshi...


{T6T185}
[Tsugumi]
Don't touch me...

I had backed her up all the way to the bed.


169 :

{T6T186}
[Tsugumi]
You want to live with this disease!?


170 :

{T6T187}
[Tsugumi]
"Once you've got the Curé virus, you can't go 
back!"


{T6T188}
[Tsugumi]
Do you have any idea what you're in for!?

She couldn't go back any farther.


171 :
Tsugumi searched for the bed behind her with
her hand.

With the tip of her outstretched hand, she
brushed across the only dose of serum left.


172 :
[Takeshi]
"But we don't know that the Curé virus will 
infect everyone."

[Takeshi]
Even you, you said you were special, right?

[Takeshi]
Please... I'm begging you.

[Takeshi]
"Let me take a gamble... so that everyone can 
live."


173 :
I stood quietly in front of Tsugumi.

My legs were unsteady.

My vision was hazy.

But I stepped forward strongly and stood up
straight.


174 :
I looked deeply into Tsugumi's eyes.

I was trying to look inside to see what lay
behind them.


175 :

{T6T189}
[Tsugumi]
You won't be able to stay with people anymore!


{T6T190}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't want everyone to live with the pain 
that I have!"

Large tears welled in her eyes.


176 :

{T6T191}
[Tsugumi]
I hate myself!


{T6T192}
[Tsugumi]
I...!


177 :
SMACK!

I slapped Tsugumi on the side of her face.

[Tsugumi]
.........

She clenched her jaw tightly against the pain
and glared at me.

Just then.

I pounced on the remaining dose of the serum,
stealing it out of Tsugumi's hand.

I took it...

And...

Smashed it into a thousand pieces on the
cold hard surface of the examination room
floor!


178 :
Crash...

It let out a sad little sound and splintered
into powdery fragments.


179 :

{T6T193}
[Tsugumi]
What are you doing...!?

[Takeshi]
There's no other way.

[Takeshi]
We've only got one option open to us now.


{T6T194}
[Tsugumi]
You idiot...


180 :

{T6T195}
[Tsugumi]
Do you know what you've done...!?


181 :

{T6T196}
[Tsugumi]
You didn't have to do that...


{T6T197}
[Tsugumi]
You know I can't fight you...!


182 :
With her lips trembling and her shoulders
shaking, Tsugumi sank down on to the bed.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I know.


{T6T198}
[Tsugumi]
You jerk...


{T6T199}
[Tsugumi]
You animal...


{T6T200}
[Tsugumi]
You're a coward...

She nestled up close to me and began to cry.

[Takeshi]
I don't care what you say.

[Takeshi]
I don't care how much you curse me.


{T6T201}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaggh...


{T6T202}
[Tsugumi]
You idiot... You idiot...


{T6T203}
[Tsugumi]
"If you mess this up... I'll never forgive 
you, Takeshi..."

[Takeshi]
It's okay... It's going to be okay...

[Takeshi]
"I promise you... we're all going to get out 
of this... okay?"


{T6T204}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaagh... Uuuugh...


{T6T205}
[Tsugumi]
Waaaaaaah...!

She raised her voice in a loud wail.

She started crying like a small child.

She threw away everything that was holding
her back and cried with everything she had.

Y¤u started operating the terminal...

The refining machine whirred to life.

The scanner also started to move.

Wiping away her tears, she stuck out her arm.

Y¤u gently took her arm and drew some blood.

The whole time, Tsugumi held onto my hand...

She continued to cry, letting out sobs
occasionally.


183 :
My consciousness started to fade.

I lost all sense of time.

It was hard to tell if it was reality or a
dream.

Was I alive?

Was I dead?

And where was the 'me' that was thinking about
all these things?


184 :

{T6T206}
[Y¤u]
It's fine now...


{T6T207}
[Y¤u]
I think it worked...


{T6T208}
[Y¤u]
I've prepared the shots...


{T6T209}
[Y¤u]
So next... it's up to you... Tsugumi.

.........


{T6T210}
[Tsugumi]
If...


{T6T211}
[Tsugumi]
You don't wake up from this...


{T6T212}
[Tsugumi]
I'll never forgive you...


{T6T213}
[Tsugumi]
Not as long as I live...

.........


{T6T214}
[Kid]
Tsugumi, where... are you going?


{T6T215}
[Tsugumi]
Well, I...


{T6T216}
[Tsugumi]
I left a friend of mine upstairs.


{T6T217}
[Tsugumi]
I've got to go meet him. My best friend...


{T6T218}
[Tsugumi]
Djungarian hamster...


{T6T219}
[Tsugumi]
His name is Chami...


{T6T220}
[Kid]
...Chami...?


{T6T221}
[Tsugumi]
See you.


185 :
.........

......


186 :
I woke from my stupor.

A stale, cold feeling...

I realized I had been sleeping sprawled on the
floor.

I slowly raised my body.

I tried opening and closing my fists.

Strange.

The movement left me with an uncomfortable
sensation, like it wasn't my own.

I shook my head.

I tried slapping my cheek.


I breathed in the cold air, then breathed out.

Strange...


The inside of my head stayed dull and murky.


I dragged myself to consciousness, forcefully
reeling myself back to clarity.

Putting my hands on the floor, I pulled up my
heavy, aching body.

My feet faltered.

But somehow, I managed to stand.

I looked around the infirmary.

I saw several used syringes scattered on the
floor.

The Kid was still slumped against £o¢o's pod.


He looked disturbingly bad, just completely
out of it.

Tsugumi was nowhere to be seen.


I wondered where she'd gone to...?

Y¤u was half-slumped over the terminal
console, snoring away.

She looked like she was in some pain and was
perspiring in her sleep.

Her hand was pushed against the panel as if
she had been in the middle of typing.

On the monitor, auto-repeated strands of
letters were lined up without meaning.


187 :

{VSE03_06}
[???]
...! ...!

What the...?

I heard a strange sound.

I re-inserted the voice converter into my ear.

...It wasn't a problem with the converter.


188 :

{T6T222}
[???]
Come in...


{T6T223}
[???]
IBF Three, please respond.


{T6T224}
[???]
"This is the emergency rescue team from the 
Maritime Defense Force."


{T6T225}
[???]
We are being directed by Insel Null.

Was I actually hearing someone's voice over
the speaker!?

189 :
I hurried over to the terminal and removed
Y¤u's hands from it, taking over the control
panel.

[Takeshi]
H-hello!

[Takeshi]
This is the IBF infirmary... over!


{T6T226}
[Mission Control]
"IBF Three!? I repeat, this is the Maritime 
Defense Force emergency rescue team calling 
from the control center at Insel Null."


{T6T227}
[Mission Control]
Can you hear me?

[Takeshi]
Yeah! Okay... loud and clear!

I was somehow able to force out an answer.

Voices spilled out from the other end of the
line.

'Hey, there are survivors down there!'

'I can't believe it!'

'That's amazing!'

That was what I wanted to say.

It seemed like Y¤u had been able to restore
the communication lines...


{T6T228}
[Mission Control]
"We're sending a rescue team immediately. Can 
you access the pool in IBF Three?"

[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah, it should be fine.


{T6T229}
[Mission Control]
"Do you know how many survivors there are and 
where they are located?"

[Takeshi]
"In the examination room, there are five... no, 
six."


{T6T230}
[Mission Control]
Six. I copy.


{T6T231}
[Mission Control]
"A rescue team is headed there in a private 
sector salvage vessel. When it arrives, 
I want you to follow its directions and 
get out of there."

[Takeshi]
How long 'til they get here?


{T6T232}
[Mission Control]
"They're going as fast as they can, but it'll 
take about an hour."

One hour...

£o¢o would be able to get out of the pod by
then.

I just hoped we had that long...


{T6T233}
[Mission Control]
However, if something goes wrong...


{T6T234}
[Mission Control]
"There should be a small deep-exploration 
submarine left in the research facility. I 
hate to make you do this, but I want you to 
escape to that area."

[Takeshi]
"S-something goes wrong...? Wh-what do you 
mean...?"


{T6T235}
[Mission Control]
"LeMU's partition strength threshold is 
already being exceeded."


{T6T236}
[Mission Control]
"If one section implodes, there's the risk 
that another area could collapse and start 
sinking."


{T6T237}
[Mission Control]
"If that happens, we think there's a high 
possibility that heavy pieces could crash 
down on the research facility."

[Takeshi]
You don't say...


{T6T238}
[Mission Control]
"Of course, we're doing everything we can to 
get to you before that happens."


{T6T239}
[Mission Control]
"We're heading there no matter what! 
So please hang on a little longer!"

Click...

The communications cut out suddenly.

[Takeshi]
Ah, hey! W-wait a sec!

I hit the call button repeatedly, but there
was no answer.

[Takeshi]
"Damn it, we can't open up communications 
from this side..."

I didn't have any other choice.

I began reading through the manual on the
side of the communication terminal.

A minisub for deep sea exploration...

We hadn't found it when we'd searched the
place...

[Takeshi]
Ah, here it is!


190 :
Following the instructions, I used the control
panel to call up information on the monitor.

[Takeshi]
It's a small electric submersible...

The submarine was in a separate sealed sector
attached to IBF.

The specifications said it was a 'neutral
buoyancy' miniature submarine for saturation
diving.

The important thing was that it could be brought
over to the pool by remote control.

[Takeshi]
"If things get dangerous, I guess they want 
us to board this."


191 :
I quickly went about setting up the remote
control program so that we could move the
submarine at a moment's notice if we had to.

[Takeshi]
Alright...

[Takeshi]
All we have to do now is...

[Takeshi]
Get Tsugumi and Sora over here...

(Sora...)

(How are we going to get Sora here...?)

I was overcome by unease.


192 :
BOOOooom!

Suddenly, a low metallic sound reverberated
throughout the complex.

The sound... seemed to come from above...


193 :
An alarm sounded from the terminal, and the
screen changed.

'Warning: flooding has occurred in LeMU'

[Takeshi]
LeMU...!?

[Takeshi]
This is bad...

[Takeshi]
That means... Tsugumi and Sora...!


194 :
I ran out into the corridor.

It was only slight, but the floor was
trembling.

[Takeshi]
Agh...


195 :
I suddenly became dizzy again.


196 :
Losing my balance, I crashed into a wall.

It seemed I wasn't completely recovered yet.

I didn't have any idea if the antibodies were
working or not...

Not a clue.

[Takeshi]
I... still gotta go...

[Takeshi]
I have to GO!


197 :
I mustered all of the strength I could and
staggered toward the elevator.


198 :
As soon as the door opened, I flew into the
lift.

The elevator headed up.


{T6T240}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 90 meter...>


{T6T241}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 80 meter...>


{T6T242}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 70 meter...>

Upward...


199 :
The elevator stopped.

Forcing open the door, I slipped into the
pressurization chamber.


200 :
The entrance had closed automatically.


201 :
I pressed the intercom button repeatedly.


[Takeshi]
Sora! Soraaa!


202 :

{T6T243}
[Sora]
Ku-Kuranari-san!? What are you...?

[Takeshi]
Hey! It's been a while!

I realized how much I had missed that voice.

I waved to Sora as she appeared outside the
window.


{T6T244}
[Sora]
Wh-what are you doing here!?

[Takeshi]
Well, it's obvious, isn't it? I came back.

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
What's the damage?


{T6T245}
[Sora]
There's flooding in Zweiter Stock.


{T6T246}
[Sora]
"The warehouse area has been breached, and 
cracks are beginning to form in the elevator 
shaft. The situation is serious."


{T6T247}
[Sora]
"There is over fifteen centimeters of flooding in 
almost all of the corridors."

[Takeshi]
Where's Tsugumi?


{T6T248}
[Sora]
She's... trapped in the infirmary...

[Takeshi]
What about the door?


{T6T249}
[Sora]
The electronic lock has been released. But...

[Takeshi]
It won't open 'cause of the water pressure?


{T6T250}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T6T251}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, I'm going to start decompressing the 
chamber."

[Takeshi]
How long will it take?


{T6T252}
[Sora]
I will complete it as soon as possible.

[Takeshi]
I need to know how much time!


{T6T253}
[Sora]
If I hurry... twelve hours.

[Takeshi]
Tw-twelve hours!? We don't have that long!


{T6T254}
[Sora]
"If we don't dissolve the nitrogen in your 
blood, you will get decompression sickness."

[Takeshi]
I don't care! Open that door now!


{T6T255}
[Sora]
I can't do that...!

[Takeshi]
If we don't act fast, Tsugumi is dead!


{T6T256}
[Sora]
"If we open that door now, due to the rapid 
decompression, the nitrogen in your 
bloodstream will form bubbles, causing blood 
clots, and in the worst case..."

[Takeshi]
I don't care, you get that door OPEN NOW!


{T6T257}
[Sora]
I can't... It's too...


203 :
I found an emergency escape lever inside
the chamber and pulled on it.


204 :
I kicked the door.


205 :
KABOooM!

There was a horrible noise, as though all the
air inside had exploded.

My body was thrown from the room along with
the high-pressure gas that had built up inside.



206 :
I was tossed like a piece of confetti,
sliding and rolling along the floor all the
way to the control room.

My body crashed heavily against the wall.


207 :
[Takeshi]
Gaagh!

[Takeshi]
...EeeaaAAAAGGHH!

[Takeshi]
WAAAAaaaah...

Pain wracked my body.

And it wasn't because I had smacked into a
wall.

Although I kept spewing out my breath, it
felt like air kept bubbling up in my lungs.

A terrible exhaustion.

My whole body felt strung out.

My eyes felt swollen and painful.

The muscles in my limbs began to jerk and
spasm.

Numbness. Pain. Headache.

I felt like I had no room to move.


208 :
[Takeshi]
Urgh... uurrgh...

According to astronomers, humans could live for
a short period of time even if they were
thrown out of a spaceship into space.

But fish brought quickly up from the sea
depths to sea level died instantly because
the pressure difference caused their organs
to burst.

So was I an astronaut, or...


209 :

{T6T258}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, your voice converters!


210 :
I felt a splitting pain deep in both ears.

Repelled by my eardrums, the voice converters
flew out of my ears.

I hurriedly held both ears with the palms of
my hands and knocked them, as though trying
to drain water from them.


{T6T259}
[Sora]
......! .........!

I couldn't hear what Sora was screaming.

All I could do was lie on the floor, trying
to suck in air.

Like a fish that had been pulled out of the
water...

A few minutes passed...

.........


211 :
The earphones that I had been wearing had
broken in half.

I got up weakly.


212 :
I saw some extra voice converters on the edge
of the console.

I crammed them forcefully into my ears.


213 :

{T6T260}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san!


214 :

{T6T261}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... Are you okay?

Tears welling up in her eyes, Sora looked at
me with a pained expression.

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay. I'm still alive.

At least my eardrums hadn't burst...


215 :
I left Himmel and started heading up.

I checked the screen on my PDA.

It showed a map of LeMU, and a blinking dot
showed me where Tsugumi was...

From the console at Himmel, I had installed a
program to link data from LeMU's sensors to
my PDA.

Sora had prepared it for me.


216 :
[Takeshi]
"Don't you stop me, you hear? No matter what 
you say, I'm going."


{T6T262}
[Sora]
"Alright, Kuranari-san. It seems that you've made 
up your mind..."


{T6T263}
[Sora]
"I'll stay here in Himmel to keep track of 
the situation at LeMU and send updates to 
your PDA."


{T6T264}
[Sora]
"I'll do what I can to stop the partitions 
from failing... to see that this place stays 
together even a little while longer. So..."


{T6T265}
[Sora]
"Promise me... that you'll come back here with 
Komachi-san..."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, it's a promise.


217 :
Running up the stairs, I looked down at my
PDA again.


218 :
The life sign in the infirmary wasn't moving.

The map showed that the surrounding corridors
were flooded and that there was no way to
access the area.

But...

I knew what I had to do.


219 :
The area I wanted to go was filled with water.

But because the watertight doors had shut on
all sides of the floor, the water had stopped
flowing.

In that case... I thought I could make it.


220 :
I went to the emergency corridor leading
under the infirmary and dove in.

How many times had I gone back and forth down
that corridor?

My PDA backlight shined a weak light on the
area before me.

Even then...

I wondered how many more meters it was, but my
body remembered.

Even if I closed my eyes, I knew I could make
it there.

{16:4}

221 :
Turning off the light, I propelled myself
forward through the darkness.

I wouldn't let the darkness overtake me
anymore.

It wasn't something that I would run away from
or be afraid of...

I would take the darkness inside of me and
make it my own...

That was why I wasn't afraid.

There was nothing to be afraid of.

{16:4}

222 :
SPLASH!

Entering the room from the hole of the
elevator shaft, I quickly climbed into the
infirmary.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!


{T6T266}
[Tsugumi]
.........!

She was in a corner of the room, hugging her
knees to herself.

At her feet was the slightly wet, furry
figure of Chami.


223 :

{T6T267}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi... Why... Why...!?

Tsugumi looked at me with wide-open eyes.


[Takeshi]
What are you so worked up about, Tsugumi?

[Takeshi]
I came back to pick you up! I came back for you!

[Takeshi]
Well, I guess I'm a bit late, but...

I scratched my nose.


224 :

{T6T268}
[Tsugumi]
Y-you idiot! What are you doing here!?


{T6T269}
[Tsugumi]
Do you... want do die!?

One after another, large tears started falling
from her eyes.

[Takeshi]
Listen...

I was laughing as I spoke.

[Takeshi]
"I came back for something I forgot... Um, yeah, 
that's it."


225 :

{T6T270}
[Tsugumi]
You... forgot...?

Picking up Chami in both hands, she stood up
slowly.

[Takeshi]
Yeah. Left it here, silly me...

[Takeshi]
My irreplaceable...

[Takeshi]
"More important to me than anything 
else... friend..."


226 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


{T6T271}
[Tsugumi]
...How...


227 :

{T6T272}
[Tsugumi]
How...did you get here?

She looked at me as though she still couldn't
believe I was actually there.

[Takeshi]
Well, I'm a good swimmer.

[Takeshi]
"Actually, I swam down and back in a 25-meter 
pool once."

[Takeshi]
I kicked off the wall coming back, but still...

I waved my hands to dismiss it.

[Takeshi]
Wait, I think I just beat my record...

[Takeshi]
"Hey? Do you remember the furthest I've ever 
swum underwater?"


228 :

{T6T273}
[Tsugumi]
...Fi...


{T6T274}
[Tsugumi]
51 meters...?

She answered, her expression beginning to
break down.

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
You think I'd die in a place like this?

[Takeshi]
I mean...

[Takeshi]
"I still haven't gotten enough abuse from you 
yet."

[Takeshi]
"I want to hear what you've got to say from 
here on out..."


229 :

{T6T275}
[Tsugumi]
Aaagh...

[Takeshi]
So...

[Takeshi]
I came for you, Tsugumi.


230 :

{T6T276}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... Takeshi!

We ran to one another.

Reaching out our hands...

We came together.

I gently wiped away the teardrops around her
mouth with my lips.

And in the center of the infirmary, we held
each other close, embracing firmly.

Riding on both of our hands, Chami snorted and
looked at us.

[Takeshi]
Alright, let's go back... together.


231 :

{T6T277}
[Tsugumi]
Okay...

Tsugumi softly held Chami and hid him inside
the chest of her clothing.


232 :
We had no time to lose.


233 :
It was only a matter of time before the place
collapsed in on itself.

We had to hurry.

I knew that...

But I wasn't in a rush.

We would make it.

I'd never say quit.

I'd never say it was too late.

I knew it was going to be okay.


234 :
Pulling on Tsugumi's hand, I flew like the
wind.


235 :

{T6T278}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, Komachi-san!


{T6T279}
[Sora]
"I've prepared the chamber for you! Get inside, 
quickly!"


236 :
I opened up the sliding door and rushed to
the other side of the glass.


237 :
We went in the compression chamber for IBF.


238 :

{T6T280}
[Tsugumi]
*Pant*... *pant*...

Slouching back in a chair, Tsugumi struggled
to catch her breath.

[Takeshi]
*Pant*... *pant*...

I didn't think that I would be able to move
for a while.


239 :
[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
Sora... You're coming too...

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
What's wrong...?

[Takeshi]
You can't come no matter what?

[Sora]
.........

The door to the room shut automatically.


240 :
The compression started...

[Takeshi]
Sora...

Sora stood silently outside of the chamber.

[Takeshi]
Sora!

I started to open up the door.

Once again, I reached out to the emergency
lever on the side of the door.


241 :

{T6T281}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... it is okay.

Sora smiled softly from the other side of the
window.

She scrunched her eyebrows as if perplexed.

Then, slowly, she shook her head from side to
side.


{T6T282}
[Sora]
I will be fine. Don't worry about me.


{T6T283}
[Sora]
I told you before, didn't I?


{T6T284}
[Sora]
I am not here.


{T6T285}
[Sora]
And yet I am everywhere.


{T6T286}
[Sora]
I am here, and at the same time there.

[Takeshi]
.........


242 :

{T6T287}
[Sora]
I do not exist.


{T6T288}
[Sora]
And yet‡LI exist everywhere.


{T6T289}
[Sora]
"There will be a time when we meet again. I'm 
sure of it."


{T6T290}
[Sora]
"If you die, we will never be able to meet 
again."


243 :

{T6T291}
[Sora]
So please...


{T6T292}
[Sora]
Please don't ask me anything now.

[Takeshi]
Sora...


244 :

{T6T293}
[Sora]
Believe me, Kuranari-san.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6T294}
[Sora]
Thank you.

Her RSD image started to warp and break up.

A fog enveloped Sora from behind.

Sora's image changed to a rainbow hue.

And then, even the rainbow...

Started to fade.

Sora was disappearing...

Watching that happen, I wondered where she
really was?

Would there really come a time when we would
meet again?

All I could do was trust her last words to me.


245 :
[Sora]
.........

But she just stood there without moving.


She wouldn't make it...

Water...

Water was flooding into Himmel's control room.

Her image broke up and disappeared...

A fog enveloped Sora, covering her over. She
disappeared without a word.


246 :
An hour later.

The room on the other side of the compression
chamber had already filled with water.

The compression finished...

Tsugumi and I transferred to the lift and
went down to IBF

.........


247 :
As soon as we entered the room, the lights
came on.


248 :

{T6T295}
[Tsugumi]
It's quiet...

[Takeshi]
Yeah, you're right...

The flooding should have been fairly advanced
in the area above us.

Perhaps some of the sections had started to
collapse.

But the surface of the pool hardly even
rippled.

As if there were nothing going on.

I wondered how much longer the place would
hold...

[Takeshi]
Ah...


249 :

{T6T296}
[Tsugumi]
What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
The time... We're past the scheduled time.


250 :

{T6T297}
[Tsugumi]
What schedule?

[Takeshi]
Actually, there's a rescue team on its way.


{T6T298}
[Tsugumi]
Rescue...?

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. They called themselves the Maritime 
Defense Force, I think."

[Takeshi]
"Y¤u was able to open up a communication line 
to Insel Null."


251 :
I turned the handle on the door of the
examination room.


252 :
The lights came back on in the room.


253 :

{T6T299}
[Tsugumi]
Ah...


{T6T300}
[Tsugumi]
They aren't here... Nobody's here!?

Tsugumi searched around the examination room.


254 :
Then she checked each of the capsule pods.

I also did a quick search of the room.

£o¢o's pod was open.

The manual for the control panel was opened
to the same page.

The used bottles of serum lay strewn on the
floor.

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
"Y¤u, the Kid, £o¢o, that researcher... 
They're all gone."


255 :

{T6T301}
[Tsugumi]
Where did they go?

Tsugumi was starting to panic.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, hold on. I'm sure the rescue team found 
them."


256 :
Just then, a voice that I recognized came over
the speaker.

I hit the talk button.

Tsugumi was next to me, staring at the monitor.


257 :

{T6T302}
[Mission Control]
This is Insel Null Control. Please respond.

[Takeshi]
This is the examination room in IBF Three, over!


{T6T303}
[Mission Control]
Thank goodness... That's where you were.


{T6T304}
[Mission Control]
"A little while ago, we got a message from the 
dispatch team that they couldn't find you. 
You had us worried there."

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry, I was out for a bit.


{T6T305}
[Mission Control]
"We were able to rescue the other three 
people in the examination room, and they are 
being cared for in the salvage vessel."


258 :
[Takeshi]
Is everyone okay!?


{T6T306}
[Mission Control]
"We can't say for sure... Their conditions are 
serious."


{T6T307}
[Mission Control]
"We're fighting against time. The submersible 
is going to surface soon, and we'll transfer 
them to a floating medical center."

[Takeshi]
Okay. You take care of them.


{T6T308}
[Mission Control]
How many people are there with you?

[Takeshi]
Two, including me.

[Takeshi]
There's one person that didn't make it...


{T6T309}
[Mission Control]
"Roger. We'll send the team back there as 
soon as we can."


{T6T310}
[Mission Control]
"But there is the possibility that the team 
won't be able to approach IBF if it starts to 
break up."

[Takeshi]
"I've got the exploration vessel standing by. 
I can call it here by remote control, right?"


{T6T311}
[Mission Control]
"Ah, yeah... I'm sorry to have to ask you to 
use it, but there's nothing else we can do."


{T6T312}
[Mission Control]
"We'll do the best we can. Whatever happens, 
you hang in there."

[Takeshi]
Roger.

Click...

The communications cut out.


259 :

{T6T313}
[Tsugumi]
What's that supposed to mean?

[Takeshi]
You weren't listening?

[Takeshi]
It means...

[Takeshi]
"All this would be for nothing if everyone 
died while they were waiting for us."

[Takeshi]
"The rescue team decided to put a higher 
priority on getting Y¤u, the Kid, and £o¢o to 
the hospital rather than waiting for us."


260 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


261 :

{T6T314}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... You're right...


262 :
The color in Tsugumi's face slowly returned to
normal as her sense of panic faded.

[Takeshi]
Well...

[Takeshi]
"I might just take a nap until the next bus 
comes..."


263 :

{T6T315}
[Tsugumi]
B-bus?

[Takeshi]
"If you think the bus is going to be late, 
call a taxi for me, will you?"


264 :

{T6T316}
[Tsugumi]
T-taxi?


{T6T317}
[Tsugumi]
What are you talking about... Takeshi?

[Takeshi]
"If you push that button, a small submarine 
will come over here by remote control‡Lour 
very own private taxi should come here from 
another area of IBF."


265 :

{T6T318}
[Tsugumi]
O-okay...

[Takeshi]
Anyway...

[Takeshi]
I'm just glad that everyone's alright...

[Takeshi]
Yes...

The adrenaline that had kept me going earlier
suddenly ran out.

[Takeshi]
I'm just... so... glad...


266 :

{T6T319}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi!?


267 :
My legs suddenly gave out...


268 :
My head struck the hard surface of the floor...


But before I could feel anything...

I slipped into a deep sleep as Tsugumi held
me in her tight embrace.
