1 :
Nearly an hour had passed since
the power had gone back online.

We gathered in the conference room on the
third floor.

Tsugumi, Sora, Y工, υ▊, and I were sitting in
chairs, just letting time pass.

The rescue team still hadn't come.

Our situation didn't show any sign of changing.

[Takeshi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C000}
[Y工]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C001}
[υ▊]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C002}
[Tsugumi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...

My yawn spread from one person to the next.

Only Sora had her head down and looked as if
she was thinking about something...


2 :

{T2C003}
[υ▊]
Oh, that's right!

υ▊ suddenly started talking.


3 :

{T2C004}
[υ▊]
"When I was in the changing room a little bit 
ago, I found this..."

As she spoke, υ▊ plucked something out of
her pocket.

It was a set of cards.


4 :

{T2C005}
[υ▊]
Hey, don'tcha wanna play cards?


{T2C006}
[υ▊]
I mean, we've got nothing to do...


{T2C007}
[Y工]
Cards, hmmm...


{T2C008}
[Y工]
So? What do you wanna play?


{T2C009}
[υ▊]
Um... Um... Let's see...


5 :

{T2C010}
[υ▊]
Oh! How about 'Super Memory'?


6 :

{T2C011}
[Y工]
Super...


{T2C012}
[Tsugumi]
...Memory?


7 :

{T2C013}
[υ▊]
What? You don't know Super Memory?

Y工 and Tsugumi looked at each other.


{T2C014}
[υ▊]
"You're kidding, right? You HAVE to know this 
game!"


8 :

{T2C015}
[υ▊]
Right? Takepyon, you know it, right?

9 :
{11:0-9f}
{11:1}Of course I know it

{11:1}I've never heard of it


10 :
[Takeshi]
Of course I know it.

I answered, full of confidence.

[Takeshi]
You want me to help you set up the cards?


11 :

{T2C016}
[υ▊]
Yes please~


12 :

{T2C017}
[Tsugumi]
W-wait a minute...


{T2C018}
[Y工]
What in the world are you talking about?


13 :
[Takeshi]
"What, are you guys scared to play Super 
Memory? Are you bad at it?"


{T2C019}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{T2C020}
[Y工]
I don't know if I'm good or bad at it.


14 :

{T2C021}
[υ▊]
Huh? You mean you really...

[Takeshi]
You guys really don't know the game?


15 :

{T2C022}
[Y工]
Nope.


{T2C023}
[Tsugumi]
Me neither.

[Takeshi]
You're kidding? I don't believe this!

I was stunned.


16 :

{T2C024}
[Y工]
Well, we don't know what we don't know.

With that, Y工 clammed up.


17 :

{T2C025}
[υ▊]
"It's a pretty famous game... At least I 
thought it was..."


18 :

{T2C026}
[υ▊]
...But it's no problem.


{T2C027}
[υ▊]
The rules are simple. I'll teach you!


19 :
[Takeshi]
I've never heard of it.

I answered without hesitating.


20 :

{T2C028}
[Y工]
Me neither.


{T2C029}
[Tsugumi]
Me neither...


21 :

{T2C030}
[υ▊]
What! Are you serious...?

A glance at Sora showed she was shaking her
head.


22 :

{T2C031}
[υ▊]
You all really don't know?

υ▊ sounded pouty.


{T2C032}
[υ▊]
Geez. Oh well...

I didn't see any reason to give up.

[Takeshi]
"Well, if we don't know, then we'll just have 
to learn..."

[Takeshi]
So, υ▊, will you explain the game to us?


23 :

{T2C033}
[υ▊]
Okay. Everybody listen, alright?


24 :
υ▊ started shuffling the cards brilliantly.


25 :

{T2C034}
[υ▊]
"First, you have to shuffle the cards really 
good..."


{T2C035}
[υ▊]
"...Then you spread the cards on the table 
like this."

She spread them out randomly so that they
didn't overlap.


26 :

{T2C036}
[υ▊]
"Then we do rock, paper, scissors, and you 
turn over cards starting with the loser."


{T2C037}
[υ▊]
"Like this... You turn over one card and then 
one more..."


{T2C038}
[υ▊]
"And if the two cards are the same number, 
then the person that turned them over gets 
them."


27 :

{T2C039}
[υ▊]
So? It's easy, huh?

[Takeshi]
Hey, everybody got it? Let's play.


28 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Y工]
.........


{T2C040}
[Tsugumi]
That's called 'Concentration'.


{T2C041}
[Y工]
Mental Guts...

[Takeshi]
Huh?


29 :

{T2C042}
[Tsugumi]
"People usually call the game 'Concentration', 
don't they...?"

[Takeshi]
What?

[Takeshi]
"Well, maybe in some backwater places they 
might call it that."


30 :

{T2C043}
[Y工]
That's not what I mean.


{T2C044}
[Y工]
"That game is clearly 'Mental Guts'. It's 
obvious!"

[Takeshi]
What're you talking about...?


31 :

{T2C045}
[υ▊]
No, it's called Super Memory.


{T2C046}
[Tsugumi]
Concentration...


{T2C047}
[Y工]
It's called Mental Guts!


{T2C048}
[υ▊]
I said that it's Super Memory!

[Takeshi]
Geez! You guys are fussy!

[Takeshi]
"Alright. I know what we'll do! Everybody calm 
down!"


32 :
[Takeshi]
We'll compromise and...

[Takeshi]
...Let's say we call it Mental Concemory...?


33 :

{T2C049}
[υ▊]
Mental...


{T2C050}
[Tsugumi]
...Concemory?

And just then...


34 :

{T2C051}
[Kid]
Here you go!

The Kid came into the conference room,
cradling six cans of cola against his
chest.

The card game stopped.


35 :

{T2C052}
[υ▊]
Hiya, Kiddo~


{T2C053}
[Y工]
Hey, Kid. That sure was thoughtful of you!

Y工 took a cola from the Kid and popped
open the tab.


36 :
She held down the carbonation to keep it from
erupting.

Like a pro, she kept from being showered with
sticky liquid.


37 :

{T2C054}
[Kid]
I got these on the way...


38 :
He noisily set the five other cans on the
table.


{T2C055}
[Kid]
...I brought these too.

The Kid turned around.

[Takeshi]
Eh? What?


39 :

{T2C056}
[Kid]
These.

Kid was pointing to the hood behind his neck.

I stuck my hand in the hood.

There were two tuna sandwiches inside it.


40 :
[Takeshi]
Huh? Where'd you get these? Did you make 'em?


41 :

{T2C057}
[Kid]
"You gave them to me when I gave you the 
flashlight."

[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right... the leftovers.

They were the sandwiches that I hadn't given
to Tsugumi and Sora during the blackout.


42 :
They were the sandwiches that I had left on
the bench during the blackout.


43 :

{T2C058}
[Kid]
I thought that somebody might be hungry.


44 :

{T2C059}
[Y工]
Oh, great!


45 :

{T2C060}
[Y工]
You're so thoughtful!

Y工 went over to the Kid and mussed up his
hair affectionately.


46 :
He stood there stiff as a rod, not resisting
at all.

I figured Y工's hands were probably pretty
sticky from the cola...


47 :

{T2C061}
[Tsugumi]
...Ahem.

Tsugumi raised her hand.


{T2C062}
[Tsugumi]
"If no one else wants one... I'll take one of 
them."

Tsugumi, unlike her normal self, spoke up.

[Takeshi]
So all that repair work made you hungry?


48 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Of course, she didn't see any need to answer
my question.


49 :
Besides, I realized she might not have eaten
anything since breakfast.

[Takeshi]
Alright. This one's for Tsugumi.

I gave Tsugumi one of the sandwiches that I
took from the Kid's hood.

Tsugumi took it without saying anything.


50 :
Then I held out the remaining one to Sora.

[Takeshi]
"The other one is for Sora. You haven't 
eaten, have you?"


51 :

{T2C063}
[Sora]
Uh, no... I'm fine...

[Takeshi]
Don't be polite. I know it tastes good.


52 :
[Takeshi]
Alright. This one's for Tsugumi.

I gave Tsugumi one of the sandwiches that I
took from the Kid's hood.

Tsugumi took it without saying anything.


53 :
Then I held out the remaining one to Sora.

[Takeshi]
"The other one is Sora's. You didn't have 
breakfast, right?"


54 :

{T2C064}
[Sora]
Uh, no... I'm fine...

[Takeshi]
"Don't be polite, I made it. I know it tastes 
good."


55 :

{T2C065}
[Sora]
Still...

[Takeshi]
Hey, I'm not kidding.


{T2C066}
[υ▊]
I'll vouch for its deliciousness!


{T2C067}
[Kid]
Uh, me too...

υ▊ and the Kid raised their hands.


56 :
[Takeshi]
Sora? What? You can't eat my food?


57 :

{T2C068}
[Sora]
That's not it...

[Takeshi]
"Then what is it? Eat too much yesterday? Or 
are you on a diet?"


58 :

{T2C069}
[Sora]
No, but... I...

[Takeshi]
"No. You have to eat or you'll get weak. 
Here! Take it!"

I tossed a cola and tuna sandwich toward
Sora.

They traced a gentle arc through the air.


59 :

{T2C070}
[Sora]
Ahh...!

Sora suddenly stretched out her hands...

She reached out, but...


60 :
Fwoosh.


61 :
Bang!


62 :
Fushaaaww!

[Takeshi]
.........

[Sora]
.........


63 :
But Sora didn't catch them.

No. She couldn't catch them.

She didn't avoid them.

It wasn't that she was too slow.

Sora was there with her hands extended into
space.

The sandwich had fallen at her feet.

The cola had violently slammed into the wall
behind her and exploded.

The spewing cola didn't get Sora wet.

The droplets looked like they flew through
Sora's body.

The sandwich wrapper covered the silhouette of
Sora's sandal...

It was as if the two had melded together.

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


64 :

{T2C071}
[Sora]
That's why I said... I didn't need it.

Sora made an embarrassed-looking expression.

[Takeshi]
Wwwwhhhhhhhhaaaaaattttttt!?

[Takeshi]
No, that's, what, I...

For some reason, I was completely stunned.

[Takeshi]
"I meant to toss them as if I was handing 
them over... That's weird... Your hand must've 
slipped..."


{T2C072}
[Sora]
"Excuse me. Kuranari-san, there is nothing strange 
about it."

[Takeshi]
"B-but! The cola blew up, and... is your 
clothing alright?"


65 :

{T2C073}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Takeshi]
"But you're... stepping on the sandwich... Your 
foot... You've got no toes, Sora-san..."


66 :

{T2C074}
[Sora]
Oh...? My gosh! Sorry about that.


67 :
And just like that, Sora's vanished toes
reappeared.

But the place where the sandwich was supposed
to be wavered unsteadily.

I felt flustered. I didn't know what was
going on.


68 :

{T2C075}
[Sora]
Uh, I guess... that you didn't know, Kuranari-san?

Sora was shuffling embarrassedly.

[Takeshi]
Sora... What... in the world are you?


69 :

{T2C076}
[Y工]
*Sigh*...

For some reason, Y工 gave a huge sigh right
next to me.

And then...


70 :

{T2C077}
[Y工]
AHAHAHAHA~

She burst out laughing.


{T2C078}
[Y工]
"I just had to watch because it was so funny, 
Kuranari..."


{T2C079}
[Y工]
You really don't listen to anything...

[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you talking about?

I was still confused.


71 :

{T2C080}
[Y工]
The explanation at the park entrance.

72 :
{11:0-a1}
{11:1}What about it?

{11:1}No! Don't say anything! I know!


73 :
[Takeshi]
So what!? What about it!?


74 :
Looking around, I saw that I was the only one
who was surprised.

υ▊ and Pipi were looking up at Sora with
impressed looks on their faces.

Tsugumi's face was blank.

The Kid looked clueless and spaced out.


75 :

{T2C081}
[Y工]
Geez! Oh well.

Y工 was laughing at my bewilderment.

[Takeshi]
"Enough fun at my expense. Tell me what's 
going on..."


76 :

{T2C082}
[Y工]
Sora is...

[Takeshi]
No! Don't say anything! I know!

[Takeshi]
I'll guess!


77 :
For some reason, I didn't want to have to have Y工
tell me.


78 :
[Takeshi]
Sora is... Sora is...

[Takeshi]
I've got it!

[Takeshi]
"Sora's the ghost of a beautiful system 
engineer that died in the prime of her life 
with her dreams still unfulfilled!"


79 :

{T2C083}
[Sora]
No.

She said it bluntly.


80 :

{T2C084}
[Y工]
Kuranari, you're not even warm.


{T2C085}
[Tsugumi]
...Don't be stupid.

[Takeshi]
W-well then, tell me what she is...


81 :
Looking around, I saw that I was the only one
who was confused.

υ▊ and Pipi were looking at Sora as if they
were impressed at something.


82 :

{T2C086}
[Y工]
Alright, alright...


83 :

{T2C087}
[Y工]
"Sora, sorry to bother you, but could you 
introduce yourself again?"


84 :

{T2C088}
[Sora]
Yes. Of course.

The punctured can had stopped fizzing.

Sora took a step toward us, carefully
avoiding the sandwich, and straightened
up.

After a slight bow, she spoke.


85 :

{T2C089}
[Sora]
I am Akanegasaki Sora...


{T2C090}
[Sora]
My official name is 'LM-RSDS-4913A'.


{T2C091}
[Sora]
"I am an artificial intelligence, or AI, 
program in charge of guiding visitors around 
LeMU."

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C092}
[Sora]
"I have been programmed as one part of the 
LeMMIH system."


{T2C093}
[Sora]
"If you call me from any nearby terminal, I 
will soon appear anywhere within LeMU."


{T2C094}
[Sora]
"My image reaches you through a network 
supporting this RSD system throughout the 
complex. I think that there are few places in 
the world boasting this kind of technology."

[Takeshi]
...?


86 :

{T2C095}
[Tsugumi]
"RSD... This really is rare. I've never seen an 
example of it this sophisticated."


{T2C096}
[Y工]
It's one of LeMU's big attractions.


{T2C097}
[υ▊]
"So that's why Sora-san disappeared during the 
blackout?"


{T2C098}
[Sora]
"Yes. I'm sorry to have caused you undue 
concern..."

I had finally lost any sense of what was
going on.

The conversation had taken off and left me
behind.


87 :

{T2C099}
[Kid]
What's RSD?


{T2C100}
[Y工]
"Simply put, it is an image display system 
that uses a semiconductor to shine a laser 
directly on your retina."


88 :

{T2C101}
[Kid]
I... I see...

The Kid gave a big nod.

But nothing about her explanation sounded
simple to me.


89 :

{T2C102}
[Tsugumi]
"And it's supporting such an advanced 
personality."

The surprising thing was that Tsugumi was
actively pursuing the conversation.


90 :

{T2C103}
[Sora]
"LeMU is fairly perfectionist when it comes to 
virtual space technologies. My existence is 
one manifestation of that."


{T2C104}
[Tsugumi]
Doesn't that require a big system?


91 :

{T2C105}
[Sora]
"Yes, but it is much smaller than it would 
have been 20 years ago."


{T2C106}
[Tsugumi]
How big? Where is it? I'd like to see it.


92 :

{T2C107}
[Sora]
"Uh... I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to say. 
It is a secret."


{T2C108}
[Tsugumi]
You weren't given the details?


93 :

{T2C109}
[Sora]
That's correct.

It seemed to me that the conversation was
getting more and more technical...


94 :

{T2C110}
[Tsugumi]
"It seems you have motivation and a will of 
your own. That you're programmed for your 
own way of thinking..."


{T2C111}
[Sora]
"That is simply the selection of responses 
from a massive bank of sampling data, the 
results of which I give back."


{T2C112}
[Tsugumi]
"Random... Oh, I see. You're a learning 
program in which positive responses are saved 
in that way and reused."


{T2C113}
[Sora]
"That is correct. I have been designed with 
specific emphasis on the functions of 
curiosity and concentration."


{T2C114}
[Sora]
"Morphological analysis from my audio input 
very likely operates at a speed and level 
of precision without peer."


{T2C115}
[Sora]
"There are also a number of special 
technologies used to create me. However, the 
specifics of these are trade secrets 
which cannot be revealed..."


95 :

{T2C116}
[Tsugumi]
"I see. There are things about you that 
normal AI can't explain, but I think I get 
the picture."

I really didn't get it at all.

It was a headache more than anything.


96 :

{T2C117}
[Tsugumi]
By the way... Sora...


{T2C118}
[Tsugumi]
"If I told you that I was actually a man, 
would you believe me?"

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Tsugumi tossed that bizarre question out of
nowhere.


97 :

{T2C119}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't anybody jump in just yet... I'm asking 
Sora. So, would you believe me?"


{T2C120}
[Sora]
No.


98 :

{T2C121}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, what if I said that I were over 20 
years old?"


{T2C122}
[Sora]
That is possible.


99 :

{T2C123}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm single. I'll probably stay that way. 
It's what I believe."


{T2C124}
[Sora]
That might well be true.


100 :

{T2C125}
[Tsugumi]
"Actually, I just learned that Takeshi had a 
sex change three years ago. It's true."


{T2C126}
[Sora]
That I cannot believe.


101 :

{T2C127}
[Tsugumi]
Heehee... You really are quite amazing.

Tsugumi laughed a little.

[Takeshi]
H-hey, Tsugumi, whaddya think you're doing?

I had to ask.


102 :

{T2C128}
[Tsugumi]
I wanted to see...


{T2C129}
[Tsugumi]
If Sora can tell when people are lying.


{T2C130}
[Tsugumi]
"To see if she can determine the truthful 
information from non-truthful, even when she 
has no background data."


{T2C131}
[Tsugumi]
"She can. She does more than compare and 
reference data with data in her memory. She's 
been programmed to factor in 'chance' and 
'intuition' to make her own judgments."


{T2C132}
[Tsugumi]
"The system is designed to make choices based 
on updated information and boost its 
efficiency by rewriting itself."


{T2C133}
[Tsugumi]
"This is an incredibly advanced level of 
technology."

[Takeshi]
Is that right?


103 :

{T2C134}
[Sora]
"Yes. My system uses state-of-the-art 
technology."


{T2C135}
[Sora]
"But I am not very good at lying... My lying 
function is underdeveloped."

Sora smiled.

[Takeshi]
"But when you introduce yourself, you say that 
you're a 'system engineer'. That's a lie, isn't 
it?"


104 :

{T2C136}
[Sora]
"That is simply a 'setting' of mine. That is 
how my profile in the mainframe computer 
reads."

[Takeshi]
...Oh.

[Takeshi]
So that's how it works.

In the end, I seemed to be the only one who
was flabbergasted that Sora was the product
of AI.


105 :
Y工 was an employee at LeMU, so of course she
knew.

Tsugumi was always cool as a cucumber. I
wondered why she knew so much about LeMU. I
guessed that she'd looked up a lot of the
information in advance.

υ▊ didn't seem to care one way or the other
whether Sora was a hologram or not. She was
just laughing and playing with Pipi.

That the Kid didn't seem surprised, well, I
put that down to his circumstances...


106 :
Several hours passed.

It seemed the sun was getting ready to set.


In the dark depths of the ocean, my sense of
time had eroded.

I checked the time on my PDA, finally making
sure it was night.

Nothing changed in LeMU.

No one new showed up to visit us.

But things hadn't taken a turn for the worse,
either. There didn't seem to be any impending
danger of floor collapse.

We each spent the time as we pleased.

We had long forgotten that we were trapped.


107 :
I decided to go see Sora.

Honestly, I was a little confused.


Sora was an AI...

I wanted to know what RSD was.

It might have been something I shouldn't have even
bothered worrying about, but I wanted to ask Sora
about it.

Without really understanding what she was all
about, I didn't think I would know how to act
around Sora.


108 :
[Takeshi]
Can you tell me more about RSD?

[Takeshi]
"You got my interest piqued... and I want to 
know more about you."


{T2C137}
[Sora]
I understand.


{T2C138}
[Sora]
"But rattling off a bunch of jargon won't do 
much good, will it? I might just confuse you 
more."

[Takeshi]
"Well, I'm no technician. If you start 
throwing out a bunch of technical terms, I'll 
just get lost."


109 :

{T2C139}
[Sora]
"I see. So you were completely 'lost' when I 
was conversing with Komachi-san?"

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. I had no clue what you two were 
saying..."

I scratched my head.

I realized that I was blushing.


110 :

{T2C140}
[Sora]
Oh, I'm sorry... Did I say something wrong?

Sora looked apologetic.

[Takeshi]
No, that was a good comeback.


111 :

{T2C141}
[Sora]
A good comeback?


{T2C142}
[Sora]
What is a good comeback?

Sora looked confused.

[Takeshi]
"Uh... It's when you say something to needle 
the person you're talking with or make a sharp 
or witty comment that makes them feel 
awkward."


112 :

{T2C143}
[Sora]
Uh, I see. I'm really sorry, Kuranari-san.

[Takeshi]
"You don't have to apologize. It didn't hurt 
my feelings or anything."


113 :

{T2C144}
[Sora]
Are you sure?

[Takeshi]
I don't mind. It was fun. Okay?


114 :

{T2C145}
[Sora]
"Uh, uh... Making a person feel awkward...
is funny?"


{T2C146}
[Sora]
That seems to be a contradiction.

[Takeshi]
"It is, but it's not. It depends on the time 
and the place."


115 :

{T2C147}
[Sora]
"That's difficult. It is hard for me to 
comprehend the concept of 'nice comeback'..."

[Takeshi]
Forget about it.

Knowing that Sora was a product of artificial
intelligence, I was impressed that she was
even able to register a joke.

I wondered if I would still be thinking that
Sora was human if I hadn't tossed that
can of cola to her...

[Takeshi]
"Uh, to get back to what we were talking 
about... Can you tell me more about RSD?"


116 :

{T2C148}
[Sora]
"Yes. Let's see... Let me try to explain using 
specific examples."

[Takeshi]
Yes please.


117 :
Sora and I headed from the rest area to the
control room.

As we walked, Sora started speaking.


118 :

{T2C149}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, can you see me?

[Takeshi]
Yeah. I see you no problem.


{T2C150}
[Sora]
And I can see you as well.


{T2C151}
[Sora]
I am standing right next to you. You're sure?

[Takeshi]
Yes, I'm sure. Positive.


119 :

{T2C152}
[Sora]
But...

Suddenly, Sora faced me and reached out toward
me.


120 :
And then...


121 :
[Takeshi]
Whoooaa!

Sora's hands slipped into my chest without
resistance.

Reflexively, I tried to grab her arms, but my
hands met with nothing.

My hands were in front of my chest, but there
was nothing there.


122 :

{T2C153}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T2C154}
[Sora]
So you are seeing me.


{T2C155}
[Sora]
However, I am not right next to you.

Saying that, Sora pulled her hand back.


123 :

{T2C156}
[Sora]
RSD stands for Retinal Scanning Display.


{T2C157}
[Sora]
The display device is not actually a display.


{T2C158}
[Sora]
Rather, a weak laser is aimed at the retina.

[Takeshi]
Retina? You mean my eye?


{T2C159}
[Sora]
Yes.


{T2C160}
[Sora]
"In the ceiling of each room and corridor are 
semiconductor laser output devices."


{T2C161}
[Sora]
"So the image is being directly reflected on 
to your retina."

[Takeshi]
Image?


{T2C162}
[Sora]
Yes. My image.

[Takeshi]
Directly on my retina...


124 :

{T2C163}
[Sora]
"Holographic screens typically allow for the 
objects behind them to be visible..."


{T2C164}
[Sora]
"This system uses the eyeball as a virtual 
screen and continuously sends an image 
synthesized with the background scenery."


125 :
[Takeshi]
Well, what about your voice?

[Takeshi]
"It sounds like your voice is coming from 
where your mouth appears."

We arrived at the rest area, and I sat on a
nearby bench.


126 :
Sora continued standing in front of me.

[Takeshi]
Sora, why don't you sit down?


{T2C165}
[Sora]
I don't get tired, so I'm fine standing.

[Takeshi]
"I understand that, but it makes me uneasy. 
It makes me feel like you're straining 
yourself or something."


{T2C166}
[Sora]
Is that right? Then excuse me...


127 :
Sora slowly sat down to the left of me.

I didn't feel the bench move under her
weight...

But looking at her, she was definitely sitting.


128 :

{T2C167}
[Sora]
We were talking about my voice.

[Takeshi]
That's right.


{T2C168}
[Sora]
Have you ever heard 3D sound?

[Takeshi]
3D sound?


{T2C169}
[Sora]
"Have you ever listened to music using 
headphones?"

[Takeshi]
Of course I have.


{T2C170}
[Sora]
"When you do, where does it sound like the 
music is coming from?"

[Takeshi]
Hmmm. Inside my head, I guess.


{T2C171}
[Sora]
"That's right. Most people hear the sound as 
if it is reverberating inside the center of 
their head, toward the back."


{T2C172}
[Sora]
"But the sound is not actually coming from 
inside your head."

[Takeshi]
I guess not.


{T2C173}
[Sora]
"But if you could apply this knowledge and 
adjust the volume from the left and the right 
to accurately simulate this reverberating 
sound..."


{T2C174}
[Sora]
"Then you could create the illusion that a 
sound was coming from above or below, left 
or right, any direction."

[Takeshi]
"I see. Oh... So you mean the voice 
converters!"

I still had both of them in my ears. I
removed them. They were about the size of the
tip of my little finger.

In front of me, Sora's mouth moved soundlessly.

It was like I couldn't hear her voice.


129 :
But that wasn't all. Then her image started
to get a little fuzzy.


130 :
[Takeshi]
Huh?

When I replaced the voice converters, Sora
returned to normal.


131 :

{T2C175}
[Sora]
"The image's position is based on the 
location of the voice converters."


{T2C176}
[Sora]
"So wherever you stand and whichever 
direction you face..."


{T2C177}
[Sora]
"LeMMIH is constantly using sensors around the 
complex that monitor the position of the voice 
converters to the millimeter."


{T2C178}
[Sora]
So that when I am 20 meters behind you...


{T2C179}
[Sora]
"My voice will sound as if I am exactly 20 
meters behind you."


{T2C180}
[Sora]
"When I am to the right, sound comes from the 
right. When I am to the left, sound comes from the 
left."


{T2C181}
[Sora]
When I am under you, sound comes from...

[Takeshi]
Under...? When you're under...?


132 :
[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C182}
[Sora]
Um, well...


133 :

{T2C183}
[Sora]
"Anyway, that is how it works. Do you 
understand?"

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C184}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, now try to face a little to the 
left."

I faced to the left as she said.

Sora stood and moved around to my right.


{T2C185}
[Sora]
"Just a moment ago, I said that LeMMIH is 
constantly monitoring your position and the 
direction you are facing..."


{T2C186}
[Sora]
"At the same time, LeMMIH is also monitoring 
the position of your eyeballs."


{T2C187}
[Sora]
"So that even if you move, I still appear in 
the same place."


{T2C188}
[Sora]
"This means that LeMMIH scans the image onto 
your eye in this way."

[Takeshi]
"So you can be made to suddenly disappear or 
reappear in another place?"


{T2C189}
[Sora]
Do you want to see it?

[Takeshi]
...No... I think I'll pass.


134 :
I heard someone come running up to us.


{T2C190}
[υ▊]
Oh, Takepyon!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


135 :
The small footsteps were those of υ▊ and
Pipi.


136 :

{T2C191}
[υ▊]
Hey, Takepyon, have you seen Sora-san around?

[Takeshi]
"What're you talking about? She's right in 
front of you..."


137 :

{T2C192}
[υ▊]
Right in front?


{T2C193}
[υ▊]
But there's nobody here.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


138 :
υ▊ tilted her head questioningly as she
said that.


{T2C194}
[υ▊]
Hmmmm...


139 :

{T2C195}
[υ▊]
Oh well. See you later.


140 :
After looking around us, υ▊ left.


141 :
Sora was still standing right next to me.

υ▊ hadn't been able to see Sora.

No, that wasn't it.

[Takeshi]
So that's it...

[Takeshi]
"So your image wasn't being scanned onto 
her retina."


{T2C196}
[Sora]
There you go. You're quick to pick it up.


{T2C197}
[Sora]
"Normally, my image is scanned on the eyes of 
all five of you."


{T2C198}
[Sora]
"It is coordinated so that it looks to 
everyone like I am in the same place, doing 
the same movement, and saying the same thing..."


{T2C199}
[Sora]
"But it is also possible to show you something 
else."


{T2C200}
[Sora]
For example...


{T2C201}
[υ▊]
Oh, Sora-san, there you are.

υ▊'s voice came from behind me.


142 :
Looking back, I saw υ▊ looking toward the
flowerbed and speaking.


143 :
[Takeshi]
"Oooh, so to υ▊, it looks like Sora is in 
front of that flowerbed, huh?"

[Takeshi]
Hey? Sora?

I didn't see Sora anywhere.


144 :

{T2C202}
[υ▊]
Yeah. That's why I wanted to talk to you.


{T2C203}
[υ▊]
Huh? No, no. That's not what I...


145 :

{T2C204}
[υ▊]
Oh, I see. You want me to bring it?

υ▊ was continuing her conversation with Sora.


146 :

{T2C205}
[υ▊]
"Okay. I understand. I'll go tell Nakkyu. See 
you later."


147 :
υ▊ ran off somewhere. Pipi followed her.


148 :

{T2C206}
[Sora]
So I can do this kind of thing as well.

Sora suddenly appeared before me.

[Takeshi]
Waaaa!

[Takeshi]
It's kind of like... you're a ghost.


149 :

{T2C207}
[Sora]
Yes. I hear that a lot.


{T2C208}
[Sora]
"Being in the same place and looking at the 
same thing, only some people can see it and 
some people can't."


150 :

{T2C209}
[Sora]
"I've never seen one, but if ghosts really do 
exist..."


{T2C210}
[Sora]
I imagine they exist much the way that I do.

[Takeshi]
Hmmm... Now I get it...


151 :
[Takeshi]
But there is something that bothers me.


152 :

{T2C211}
[Sora]
What is that?

[Takeshi]
"Sora, so you can't be in more than one place 
at a time?"

[Takeshi]
"For example, you couldn't be in one room 
talking to me and in another talking with υ▊?"


153 :

{T2C212}
[Sora]
Theoretically, it is possible.


{T2C213}
[Sora]
"However, the way that I am designed, I can't 
do that."

[Takeshi]
Why not?


{T2C214}
[Sora]
"I imagine it is to help maintain an image of 
reality for visitors."


{T2C215}
[Sora]
"So that there is only one 'Sora' in the 
world."


{T2C216}
[Sora]
"Without that kind of setting, visitors would 
get confused."

[Takeshi]
?


{T2C217}
[Sora]
That and it was the policy of my designer.


{T2C218}
[Sora]
"The policy of my designer was to create me as 
a character with an independent personality..."


{T2C219}
[Sora]
"That reminds me, I have heard the same thing 
about the 'United Land' characters."


{T2C220}
[Sora]
"There is only one of each character in the 
park."


{T2C221}
[Sora]
"Like in a story... there can't be any one 
character in two places at the same time..."


154 :
Sora had more work to do, so I saw her to the
control room.

It seemed strange that Sora, who could
teleport anywhere instantly, was walking...

Maybe she was doing it to humor me.


155 :
[Takeshi]
"I was wondering about the laser retina 
scan..."

[Takeshi]
"So if I was in a place that the laser 
couldn't reach, then I couldn't see you?"


{T2C222}
[Sora]
Of course not. But...


156 :

{T2C223}
[Sora]
"The scanning devices are located in every 
room of the complex, and there are mirrors 
embedded in the walls, ceilings, and floors 
to reflect the images."


{T2C224}
[Sora]
"So, almost no matter where you are, I can be 
displayed."

[Takeshi]
So there are no blind spots...


{T2C225}
[Sora]
That's the way it is designed.


{T2C226}
[Sora]
However, there is one major flaw.

[Takeshi]
Flaw?


157 :

{T2C227}
[Sora]
I...


{T2C228}
[Sora]
I am only 'seen' when someone looks at me.

[Takeshi]
What?


{T2C229}
[Sora]
"I mean that I cease to exist 
when no one is looking at me."


{T2C230}
[Sora]
"For example, if the five of you 
here all closed your eyes at once..."


{T2C231}
[Sora]
At that moment, I would cease to exist.

[Takeshi]
.........


158 :
I casually held my hand up in front of my eyes.

I covered my view forward and looked down
near my feet.

There was no sign of Sora next to me. It was
as if she had vanished or never been there
in the first place.


159 :
Surprised, I removed my hand, and Sora
reappeared in the corridor.

The outline of Sora's sandals blurred dimly
in the water.


{T2C232}
[Sora]
Someone has to 'see' me.


{T2C233}
[Sora]
I have to be seen in order to exist.


{T2C234}
[Sora]
Vision...


{T2C235}
[Sora]
Someone's perspective actually creates me.


{T2C236}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T2C237}
[Sora]
When you close your eyes, I disappear.


160 :
When we entered the control room, I heard her
being called from the console.


161 :

{T2C238}
[Sora]
Well, Kuranari-san...


{T2C239}
[Sora]
"LeMMIH is calling for me, so I will leave 
and then come back shortly."


162 :
And saying that, Sora disappeared.

Only the three-dimensional hologram depicting
LeMU hovered silently in the darkness.
