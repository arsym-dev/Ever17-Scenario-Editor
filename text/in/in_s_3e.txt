1 :
I ran out of the infirmary and called out to
Tsugumi.

[Kid]
Hey, Tsugumi!

But she ignored me and headed for the corridor.


(Ahhh... Why does it always turn out like
this?)

Even if I was tired of everything, I had no
choice but to chase after her.


2 :
[Kid]
Hey, wait!

[Tsugumi]
.........

She shot me a glance but didn't slow her step.


[Kid]
I said wait!

I caught up to her and grabbed her arm, trying
to stop her.


3 :
But she shook off my hand.


4 :

{S3D000}
[Tsugumi]
I told you never to touch me.

[Kid]
S-sorry...

[Tsugumi]
.........


5 :
Then Tsugumi started walking again, as if
nothing had happened.


6 :
Still, I continued after her without giving up.

I started talking to her as I walked next to
her, peering at her face.

[Kid]
Why are you fighting with Sara?


7 :

{S3D001}
[Tsugumi]
It's none of your business.

Tsugumi answered without looking at me,
letting me know my questions were unwanted.


{S3D002}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't go poking your nose into things that 
don't concern you."

[Kid]
How can this not concern me?

I thought I had said enough.

(It really probably doesn't have anything to
do with me.)

(I don't have any right to go involving myself
in people's private affairs.)

(But still...)


8 :

{S3D003}
[Tsugumi]
"No... Well, actually, it might have something 
to do with you."

[Kid]
What?


9 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi strode away.

I stood stunned for a moment. I soon pulled
myself together and started after her again.


10 :
No matter how much I called out to her,
Tsugumi didn't respond.

At last, I caught up with her again...


11 :
...We were at the gate for boarding the
Jellyfish Gondola.


12 :
Finally, Tsugumi stopped there.

And it didn't look as though she had stopped
there with any intention of riding the gondola.

But it didn't look like she was going to move
elsewhere either, or even sit down for that
matter.

Her eyes were just trained on the
half-transparent gondola, which was partially
visible beyond the gate.

[Kid]
Hey...

[Tsugumi]
.........

It looked like she was completely ignoring me.


[Kid]
"You don't have to respond. Just listen to 
what I'm going to say."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
I won't ask you to trust us anymore.

[Kid]
"But that doesn't mean that you have to fight 
with anyone."

[Kid]
"We're all in the same situation here. We have 
to help each other."

Tsugumi turned and faced me...


13 :

{S3D004}
[Tsugumi]
What an insightful comment.

[Kid]
Do-don't joke around.


14 :

{S3D005}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just telling you exactly how I feel.

I figured that I should take the fact that she
responded to me as a slight change in attitude.

I shot her another question.

[Kid]
"Why do you think we're your enemies? What 
reason could you possibly have?"


15 :

{S3D006}
[Tsugumi]
I've already told you. I can't trust you.


{S3D007}
[Tsugumi]
You are all acting suspiciously.


{S3D008}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't know whether you're acting of your 
own will, but still."

[Kid]
I don't get you. What EXACTLY is suspicious?


16 :

{S3D009}
[Tsugumi]
"You're trying to do the exact same thing 
that you did before."

[Kid]
The same as what before?


{S3D010}
[Tsugumi]
"If you really have lost your memory, then 
maybe you don't know..."


17 :

{S3D011}
[Tsugumi]
"There's got to be something going on behind 
the scenes with this accident as well."

[Kid]
You mean...

[Kid]
"You mean to tell me you've experienced the 
same thing as this before?"


18 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi stared at me intensely.

I took her look as an affirmation.

In that case...

In that case...

I wondered if the same held true for me.

[Kid]
"So that means you can foresee what's going 
to happen, right?"


19 :

{S3D012}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Kid]
I'm right, aren't I?

[Kid]
So it's not just me then.

[Kid]
"But how come I can see into the future 
all of a sudden...?"


20 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
Hmmm... Hmmm...

See... the future...

No, the feeling I had was less one of seeing
it and more like...

...Knowing the future, or possibly having
experienced it before...

Did I know it? Had I experienced it?

Why?

That was...


21 :
‡LBecause the same thing was happening again.

[Kid]
Th-that's it!

[Kid]
"You and I must have traveled to the past, 
Tsugumi!"


22 :

{S3D013}
[Tsugumi]
...Traveled... to the past?

[Kid]
Yup.

The theory I had hit upon excited me.


I was sure, it almost had to be...


23 :
[Kid]
I have the same sense.

[Kid]
I know the future.

[Kid]
"Back at the generator room, I knew that the 
room had built up heat."

[Kid]
"And take this morning. I had a feeling that 
there would be trouble in the warehouse."

[Kid]
"And when I first met Sara, I felt like I had 
experienced something like it before."

[Kid]
"I think I've probably experienced this same 
thing in my past..."

Tsugumi just stared at me.

I could clearly see that she was flustered.

[Kid]
Hey. Tell me your story.

When I asked Tsugumi that, it was as if she
snapped back to reality, her expression and
the look in her eyes back to normal.


24 :

{S3D014}
[Tsugumi]
My story? What? Are you kidding?


25 :

{S3D015}
[Tsugumi]
"As long as I can't tell if you're in this 
with the others, I won't tell you anything."

[Kid]
.........

I felt dejected, like I had finally found
someone that could share my feelings but
wouldn't.


26 :

{S3D016}
[Tsugumi]
"Listen. I told you before, it would be best 
for you if you stayed away from them."


{S3D017}
[Tsugumi]
And me too.

[Kid]
...Why?


27 :

{S3D018}
[Tsugumi]
"You really get bogged down in the 'why' of 
things, don't you? The 'why' is not important."

She crossed her arms and said that forcefully.


28 :

{S3D019}
[Tsugumi]
"But if there is a reason... It's so that 
things turn out the best for you."

[Kid]
.........


{S3D020}
[Tsugumi]
For example...


29 :

{S3D021}
[Tsugumi]
Your memory loss could be because of them.

[Kid]
...Huh?

That was a shocking idea.

Her words just about stopped my heart for a
moment.

(What... There's no way...)

I had never even entertained that idea.


30 :
Tsugumi turned to walk away from me, ignoring
me in my state of dismayed confusion.

I didn't have any power left to chase after
her.


31 :

{S3D022}
[Tsugumi]
Oh... and there is one more thing.


{S3D023}
[Tsugumi]
"As long as we're shooting the breeze, shall 
I predict a bit of the future for you?"

[Kid]
.........

I slowly lifted up my face and looked at
Tsugumi.

She looked serious all of a sudden.

Tsugumi predicted that...


{S3D024}
[Tsugumi]
"If you continue to let yourself be used by 
them..."


{S3D025}
[Tsugumi]
On the 7th...


32 :

{S3D026}
[Tsugumi]
You will die.


33 :
I trudged along, looking down.

The light reflected cold and hard off the
walls and floor.

Tsugumi's words echoed in my mind.

Tsugumi said not to trust Takeshi, Y¤u, and the
others.

That my lost memory was their fault as well.

That their behavior was suspect?

But... I wondered if that could really be true.

I didn't see how it could be.

They all seemed trustworthy to me.

The type of people you could really depend on.

I had only spent a few days with them, but I
was sure.

Besides, even if she were right, there were
lots of things that were inexplicable.

If Takeshi and the others were scheming
something...

If they were trying to deceive Tsugumi and me,
then it should have been visible in their words and
actions.

There was no way that normal people could put
on an act as elaborate as that.

If one or two were trying to lie, it might be
possible, but even with my memory impaired I
would still be able to tell if they were all
trying to do it.

It seemed that Y¤u, Sara, and everyone else were
reacting naturally, as one might expect in
each situation.

So it didn't seem possible. It wasn't possible.


The most impossible thing to explain was why the
accident was caused. Why lie to Tsugumi and me?

There was no reason, and it would have been
impossible anyway.

I wondered if I was going to die.

That was stupid!

If that was the case, it was smarter to help each
other more than ever.


34 :
(The problem is probably with Tsugumi.)

That was what I thought.

Maybe she had some grudge against Takeshi and
the others from before... or maybe she was
imagining everything and just paranoid...

Or maybe she was trying to make ME paranoid
about the others and draw us into
conflict... or something else?

‡LNo, I had to stop it!

It was too crazy.

That was all just my imagination working
overtime... Nothing but paranoia.


It had to be that the severity of the
situation was putting incredible mental strain
on everyone.

I... I wanted to trust everyone and to be
trusted.

So, I would continue to treat everyone as I had
up until then.

That was what I decided.

Rather than worrying about who to trust, we
needed to worry about how the situation
could have happened.

If we knew the cause, we might be able to
think of a way out.

...I remembered that Tsugumi had said
something else.


{S3D009}
[Tsugumi]
"You're trying to do the exact same thing 
that you did before."

I wondered about my ability to foresee
events...

Was I repeating the past?

(I wonder if I really did travel in time?)


35 :
Finally, I arrived back at the infirmary.

But there was no longer anyone there.

(Huh? Where did everybody go?)

(Maybe they're in the conference room?)

[Kid]
Hey, Sora?

I called out to her through the microphones in
the room.

But there was no reply.

Sora had said that the complex's sensors were
not yet functioning everywhere.

I figured that I'd just have to go searching
myself...

I sighed and headed out into the corridor.


36 :
(Oh, that's right...!)

I had an idea.

The security office was nearby. I could use
the observation monitors there.

I might be able to see what was going on.

And maybe find out where everyone was.

So, I made for the security office.


37 :
When I entered the office, I saw Y¤u.

She was slouching loosely in a chair.


[Kid]
Y¤u? What are you doing here?


38 :

{S3D027}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kid. How you doing?

Y¤u swiveled her neck around and greeted me.
She couldn't be bothered to shift her body.

[Kid]
"Where's everybody else? What happened to 
Sara?"


{S3D028}
[Y¤u]
"She's resting in the decompression chamber 
below the infirmary."

Y¤u straightened up.


39 :
She added that Sara said she wanted to be
alone, so I'd best not bother her.

[Kid]
I see...


40 :

{S3D030}
[Y¤u]
"Sora had work to do in the control room. 
She's checking and adjusting the complex."

[Kid]
What about Takeshi?


41 :

{S3D031}
[Y¤u]
I don't know what's up with Kuranari.


{S3D032}
[Y¤u]
"When he left, he was saying something about 
wanting a drink. He might be having a beer or 
something."

[Kid]
Huh? A beer in LeMU?


42 :
Y¤u shrugged as if to say 'Who knows?'


{S3D033}
[Y¤u]
"What about you? How did things go with 
Tsugumi?"

[Kid]
Not good. She wouldn't listen.

[Kid]
She just took off somewhere.

I decided not to say anything about Tsugumi's
silly suspicions.


{S3D034}
[Y¤u]
Well, I guess that's how things stand then.

[Kid]
"So what are you doing here, Y¤u? You can't 
access the database for a while, right?"


43 :

{S3D035}
[Y¤u]
Right. So I'm taking a break.


44 :

{S3D036}
[Y¤u]
"Right now, I'm looking at LeMU through the 
monitors and trying to think of a way to 
escape."


45 :

{S3D037}
[Y¤u]
I haven't thought of anything yet.


46 :
Y¤u went back to typing on the keyboard.


47 :
Tap, tap, tap...

The images on the monitors changed again and
again.

Takeshi appeared in one of them.

[Kid]
Hey, that's Takeshi.


48 :

{S3D038}
[Y¤u]
Looks like it.

[Kid]
Is that the rest area?


{S3D039}
[Y¤u]
Looks like it.

[Kid]
I wonder what he's doing.


49 :

{S3D040}
[Y¤u]
Who knows?


50 :
Takeshi was sitting on a bench.

He had a can of beer in his hand.

As Y¤u had said, it looked like he was having
a drink.

[Kid]
So there really is... beer here.

Thinking about it, I realized that Takeshi
knew the kiosk's freezers by heart now.

Maybe it was something that an employee or
someone had sneaked in.

What I didn't understand was why there was one
more beer.

Rather, why the can was opened and sitting
next to Takeshi.

(It'll get flat if he leaves it like that...)

Of course, there was no one there.

Takeshi lifted his can in the direction of the
can next to him and muttered something.

But we couldn't hear what.

I wondered if he was drunk.

He looked dangerous.


51 :

{S3D041}
[Y¤u]
Geez... What is that fool up to?


52 :
Tap, tap, tap...

Y¤u punched some keys and switched to a less
unsightly scene.


53 :

{S3D042}
[Y¤u]
Okay. Time to take a break.


54 :
Y¤u jumped out of her chair and headed for the
coffee machine.

[Kid]
Uh, I want one too.


55 :

{S3D043}
[Y¤u]
Alright.

[Kid]
Where's the sugar and milk?


56 :

{S3D044}
[Y¤u]
"What? You take sugar and milk? You're like a 
kid with a sweet tooth."

[Kid]
I can drink it however I want, can't I?


57 :

{S3D045}
[Y¤u]
"Sure, whatever. I think they're in that 
drawer."

I took the sugar pot and milk bottle out from
the drawer.


58 :

{S3D046}
[Y¤u]
Coffee is coffee because it's bitter.

Y¤u said that as she poured coffee into our
cups.


{S3D047}
[Y¤u]
"Coffee with impurities is like a 
hamburger made out of chicken."


{S3D048}
[Y¤u]
Someday you'll understand, Kid.


59 :

{S3D049}
[Y¤u]
Here is your wittle miwk dwink... baby.

[Kid]
Oh shut up...

I dribbled a little milk into the cup that she
gave me.

I went to add sugar... but there was no spoon,
so I decided to pour from the sugar pot.

[Kid]
"You know that black coffee is bad for your 
stomach, right?"


60 :

{S3D050}
[Y¤u]
"I know that and a hundred other things that 
are bad. But smoking is bad for you and there 
are still smokers."

[Kid]
"Besides... when you're tired, sweet things 
give you a surge of energy."

I was in an argumentative mood.

But... then my hand slipped... and sugar went
cascading into my cup.

[Kid]
Oh no!


61 :

{S3D051}
[Y¤u]
"There you go. That should give you a surge of 
energy until tomorrow."


62 :
[Kid]
Hey, I was thinking.


{S3D052}
[Y¤u]
Thinking what?

[Kid]
I didn't tell you?


{S3D053}
[Y¤u]
This is silly.

Y¤u said that and sipped her coffee
indifferently.

[Kid]
What I said is that...!

[Kid]
I can sense the future.

I decided to tell Y¤u about my theory.


I really wanted to hear what she thought.

[Kid]
"I mean, yesterday in the generator room, the 
trouble this morning with Takeshi, and when I 
first met Sara..."


63 :

{S3D054}
[Y¤u]
That's just déjà vu.

[Kid]
Déjà vu?


64 :

{S3D055}
[Y¤u]
"When you've never done something, but you 
can't shake the feeling that you've seen or 
done it before."


{S3D056}
[Y¤u]
"But you know, that's really just when you 
have some memory deep in your mind that makes 
something feel familiar..."


{S3D057}
[Y¤u]
It's just a kind of hallucination.

[Kid]
It's not! This wasn't like that!

[Kid]
"I think I've experienced the same kind of 
thing in the past..."


65 :

{S3D058}
[Y¤u]
And? What's your point?

[Kid]
I think that... maybe I traveled through time.


66 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"And that I came back here to the past... from 
the future."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"I think it helps to explain my lost memory 
somehow."


{S3D059}
[Y¤u]
Hmmph. And? How does it explain your memory?

[Kid]
"Eh? Th-that's... uh... hard to explain, 
but..."


67 :

{S3D060}
[Y¤u]
What is going on in that head of yours?


{S3D061}
[Y¤u]
"What got all twisted up in there to make you 
come up with some crazy idea about traveling 
through time?"


68 :

{S3D062}
[Y¤u]
"Or are you one of those people that believe 
the sun circles around the earth?"

[Kid]
But... But... Right now... this...


69 :

{S3D063}
[Y¤u]
Okay!

Y¤u held her palm out at me like a traffic cop.


{S3D064}
[Y¤u]
"Okay, let's say for argument's sake that you 
did travel through time. So what?"


70 :

{S3D065}
[Y¤u]
"What connection could that possibly have with 
your missing memory?"


{S3D066}
[Y¤u]
You make absolutely no sense.

[Kid]
...


71 :

{S3D067}
[Y¤u]
"Listen. There is NO such thing as 
time travel."


{S3D068}
[Y¤u]
"Theoretically and scientifically, it's 
impossible."

I decided to drink my coffee.

(Ugghhhhhh!)

It was so sweet that it made me almost want to
vomit.


72 :

{S3D069}
[Y¤u]
"Water flows downhill and time flows forward. 
It's simple."


{S3D070}
[Y¤u]
It's like a river.


{S3D071}
[Y¤u]
There is no going backward.

[Kid]
But...

I groaned. But I wasn't giving in without a
fight.

[Kid]
Are you sure?


73 :

{S3D072}
[Y¤u]
...?

[Kid]
Water doesn't always flow down, does it?


74 :

{S3D073}
[Y¤u]
"Ha... Now what? Are you going to explain it 
all with some anti-gravity substance?"


{S3D074}
[Y¤u]
"Or something like space isn't a vacuum, but 
is full of ether?"

[Kid]
That's not what I mean.

[Kid]
It's not like that... What I mean is...


75 :
I looked around the room.

There had to be something... Something to
convince Y¤u... like...

My eyes stopped on the coffee machine.

The water in the lower container was boiling,
warmed by the flame of the alcohol lamp.

The water was siphoned up the central pipe
into the upper chamber by the pressure
of the steam.

(This is it!)

[Kid]
Look! Water doesn't always flow down. See!


76 :
[Y¤u]
...

Y¤u didn't say anything. She simply looked at
the gurgling water.

[Kid]
Hey? Are you listening?


77 :

{S3D075}
[Y¤u]
That's it!

Y¤u suddenly stood up shouting.

[Kid]
Oh! Ouch!

Y¤u bumped my arm and spilled my coffee
everywhere.

It got on my arm and her coat.

But Y¤u ignored it, handed her cup to me, and
went bursting out of the room.


78 :
She shot out of there like a rocket.

I quickly put the cups down and went after her.


79 :
Y¤u was heading to the west...


80 :
She climbed the emergency corridor...


81 :
And ran down the spiral staircase...


82 :
When I finally caught up with her...


83 :
...I found myself in the central control room.


84 :
Y¤u and I dashed into the room.

There was Sora.

She was in front of the console with both
hands together. She was quiet, her eyes
closed. It was like she was meditating.

The LED of the computer in the room was
responding by flickering repeatedly.

But when Sora noticed our presence, she opened
her eyes and smiled.


85 :

{S3D076}
[Sora]
What is it? Tanaka-san? Kid-san?


86 :

{S3D077}
[Y¤u]
*PANT*, *PANT*... I thought of a way to escape!

Y¤u shouted in between breaths.


87 :

{S3D078}
[Sora]
A way to escape?

[Kid]
R-really? You did?


88 :

{S3D079}
[Y¤u]
Well... *PANT*, *PANT*...


89 :

{S3D080}
[Y¤u]
*PANT*, *PANT*, *PANT*... Harrrph, haaaaa!


90 :
[Kid]
Are you alright...?


{S3D081}
[Y¤u]
"I'm f... fine... *PANT*... I'll be fine... 
after I rest..."


{S3D082}
[Y¤u]
Deep... b-breath... Deeeep...

Y¤u put her hand on her chest as she breathed,
deeply trying to catch her breath.

Then...


91 :

{S3D083}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Sora? Why can't we escape from here?


92 :
[Kid]
"Stupid! It's because LeMU is flooded with 
water!"


93 :

{S3D084}
[Y¤u]
Enough. I'm not asking you. Be quiet!

[Kid]
.........


{S3D085}
[Y¤u]
Sora, answer me.


94 :

{S3D086}
[Sora]
"It is as Kid-san said. It is because LeMU is 
inundated with seawater."


{S3D087}
[Sora]
"The water has blocked passage to Insel Null 
via the elevator and emergency stairs."


{S3D088}
[Sora]
"Thus, all avenues of escape have been closed 
off."


95 :

{S3D089}
[Y¤u]
"Okay. So you mean that if we could get rid of 
all of the water in LeMU, we could escape?"


96 :

{S3D090}
[Sora]
"Yes. However, with the limited wastewater 
pumps still functioning, it is impossible..."


{S3D091}
[Y¤u]
It's no problem.

Y¤u stopped Sora at that point.


97 :

{S3D092}
[Y¤u]
"The floating island has to have a 
high-pressure intake fan, right?"

[Kid]
A high-pressure fan?


{S3D093}
[Y¤u]
"A device to send in a mix of high-pressure 
gas to increase air pressure in the complex."


98 :

{S3D094}
[Sora]
Yes. It is exactly as you say.


{S3D095}
[Y¤u]
"In that case, why don't we use the 
high-pressure fan to pump in high-pressure gas 
which will then push out the water?"

[Kid]
?


{S3D096}
[Y¤u]
"If you blow air into a straw that's in water, 
the water comes out of the straw, right?"

[Kid]
Oh... I get it...


99 :

{S3D097}
[Sora]
Theoretically, it is possible.


100 :

{S3D098}
[Y¤u]
I told you! Let's do it!


101 :

{S3D099}
[Sora]
"And it is one of the methods that I 
considered initially."


102 :

{S3D100}
[Y¤u]
Huh...?


{S3D101}
[Sora]
"In other words, unfortunately, it is 
impossible."


{S3D102}
[Y¤u]
Why?


{S3D103}
[Sora]
Because we can't activate the fan from here.


{S3D104}
[Sora]
"It is the same as with the reason the 
elevator is out of order. The cause is 
unclear."


103 :
[Y¤u]
.........


104 :

{S3D105}
[Sora]
It is very unfortunate.


105 :
[Y¤u]
.........

Y¤u's shoulders slumped dejectedly.

[Kid]
Y¤u...

I put my hand on Y¤u's back. She turned and
smiled an empty smile.


106 :

{S3D106}
[Y¤u]
"Ha... Damn... I thought it was a good idea 
too."


107 :

{S3D107}
[Y¤u]
I guess I'll have to rethink it.

But her words sounded devoid of the spark she'd
shown earlier.


108 :

{S3D108}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

Only then did Y¤u finally notice the coffee
stains.


{S3D109}
[Y¤u]
Oh... Yuck... This is gonna stain for sure!


109 :

{S3D110}
[Sora]
"There is a laundry room right next to the 
changing room. Why don't you wash it there?"


{S3D111}
[Sora]
"Fortunately, you have a change of clothes as 
well."


110 :

{S3D112}
[Y¤u]
That's true...

Y¤u took an area of her coat that was stained
black and held it to her nose.


{S3D113}
[Y¤u]
*Sniff*, *sniff*...


111 :

{S3D114}
[Y¤u]
Yuck! This stinks like sugar...


112 :
(You mean it smells like coffee!)

...That was what I wanted to say, but I just
barely held my tongue.
