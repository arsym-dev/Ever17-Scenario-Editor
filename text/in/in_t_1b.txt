1 :
There were still fish flopping around on the
floor, but the water had receded a while
earlier.


2 :

{T1A034}
[Park staff]
"This sector is confirmed to be drained 
of water..."


{T1A035}
[Park staff]
"However, 30% of the facility is 
already..."


3 :

{T1A036}
[Park staff]
"Believed to be submerged or completely 
flooded..."

[Takeshi]
Hey, wait just a second...

[Takeshi]
I thought we were going to escape UP!

[Takeshi]
If we go down...!

[Takeshi]
Hey! What are we supposed to do now?


4 :

{T1A037}
[Girl]
There's no point arguing about this.


{T1A038}
[Park staff]
I'm sorry, but...

The employee looked extremely sorry and was
bowing.


5 :

{T1A039}
[Park staff]
It is my responsibility.

6 :
{11:0-80}
{11:1}That's it! Get me the person in charge!

{11:1}It's not your fault

{11:1}That's not important right now...


7 :
[Takeshi]
That's it! Get me the person in charge!

[Takeshi]
"It's no good blaming someone that works here 
like you, but..."

[Takeshi]
How could this happen? I want an explanation!

[Takeshi]
"I came here with my friends and just missed 
taking the elevator..."

[Takeshi]
I don't believe this..!


8 :

{T1A040}
[Girl]
Take it easy...

[Takeshi]
You be quiet...


9 :

{T1A041}
[Girl]
Stop it!

The girl was glaring at me intensely.


10 :

{T1A042}
[Girl]
Why don't you just be quiet...

Her icy, threatening voice overwhelmed me.

[Takeshi]
Al-alright.


11 :
[Takeshi]
It's not your fault.

[Takeshi]
"I don't think that this is any one person's 
fault."

[Takeshi]
But why has this happened?

[Takeshi]
That's... the issue.

[Takeshi]
"Sorry. I'm just a little aggravated. I 
didn't mean to take it out on you..."


{T1A043}
[Park staff]
It's okay...


12 :
[Takeshi]
No, relax... Yeah, let's all relax...

[Takeshi]
"I'm glad to be safe, but more important than 
that right now is... Who are you guys?"

[Takeshi]
"The chick in black ran like something 
bionic..."

[Takeshi]
"When the glass broke, that attendant was 
right next to it. But she took off at warp 
speed..."

[Takeshi]
What's up with that?

[Takeshi]
"And don't tell me that this is part of the 
theme park atmosphere?"


13 :
[Girl]
.........

[Park staff]
.........

Neither of them tried to answer.


14 :
The fish on the floor were still jumping
around.


15 :

{T1A044}
[Park staff]
I'm really, really sorry...

The park employee was bowing so low that her
head approached the floor.

For some reason, her clothes were completely
dry.


16 :

{T1B000}
[Girl]
"It doesn't do us any good just standing 
around here. Can you show us the way?"


{T1B001}
[Park staff]
"Certainly. There is a relatively safe place 
nearby. I will take you there..."

(RELATIVELY safe...?)

That was about the same as saying that
everywhere else was dangerous.


17 :
We turned around and started heading back the
corridor we'd been washed down.

I looked at a panel and finally realized that
we were in Zweiter Stock‡Lbasement level two.


18 :
We went in a nearby attraction.

[Takeshi]
So are we the only folks here?


19 :

{T1B002}
[Park staff]
I do not know. I am currently investigating.

'Yeah right, investigating what?', I thought
as we walked...


20 :

{T1B003}
[Park staff]
Ah!

[Takeshi]
What is it?


21 :

{T1B004}
[Park staff]
Three other people are approaching.

[Takeshi]
...What?


22 :

{T1B005}
[Park staff]
*Sigh*...


{T1B006}
[Park staff]
"For a while, I wondered what was going to 
happen to us, but..."

It was one of the female employees that
I'd met once before.


23 :

{T1B007}
[Park staff]
I'm glad we survived...


24 :

{T1B008}
[Park staff]
Hey, aren't you...?

The girl finally noticed us.

[Takeshi]
I didn't think there'd be anybody else here.


25 :

{T1B009}
[Park staff]
Yeah. How are you?

[Takeshi]
About as good as I look, I suppose.


{T1B010}
[Park staff]
Seems like you had a rough time of it too...

[Takeshi]
Hey, lucky guess...

Relaxing a bit, I returned her smile.


26 :
There were two people behind the girl.

One of them was the girl who I thought was
named £o¢o.


27 :
When our eyes met, £o¢o grinned.


{T1B011}
[£o¢o]
Oh, we meet again.

[Takeshi]
It's been a while.

[Takeshi]
"It doesn't have to be right now, but £o¢o, 
will you tell me a joke later? I'm really in 
the mood for one."


28 :

{T1B012}
[£o¢o]
Sure. No problem, I'll think of one.

She nodded brightly.


29 :

{T1B013}
[Kid]
.........

The other person was the kid I brought to the
infirmary.

His expression looked darker somehow.

If he'd become super upbeat all of a
sudden, that would have been weird too, but...

For some reason, it bothered me.

[Takeshi]
"Is something wrong with him? He doesn't look 
so hot."


30 :

{T1B014}
[Park staff]
Oh, he's... a bit...

The attendant hesitated.


31 :

{T1B015}
[Park staff]
By the way...


32 :

{T1B016}
[Park staff]
"Hey, Sora, do you have any idea what 
our situation is?"

The girl attendant addressed the question to
the staff member in the dress.


33 :

{T1B017}
[Sora]
"Well, the communication lines are down... 
I've been investigating ways to restore our 
connection, but it's going to take some time."

The attendant called Sora said that.


34 :

{T1B018}
[Park staff]
"In that case, let's go to the central 
control room. We can monitor things in detail 
from there, right?"


35 :

{T1B019}
[Sora]
"That sounds good. I wish I were more 
useful..."


{T1B020}
[Park staff]
Don't worry about it, Sora.


36 :
With that, the girl addressed me again.


{T1B021}
[Park staff]
"We're going down to Dritter Stock‡Lthe third 
floor underwater."


{T1B022}
[Park staff]
You're coming, right?

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah. I'll go.


37 :
We took an emergency corridor behind one of
the attractions.

It looked like there were a number of similar
narrow corridors above and below other
corridors and rooms.

I figured that they were probably used as
shortcuts by employees as well.


38 :

{T1B023}
[Park staff]
My name is Tanaka.


39 :

{T1B024}
[Y¤u]
"Tanaka Y¤u. My real name is a lot 
longer, but just call me Y¤u. What's your 
name?"

[Takeshi]
I'm Kuranari Takeshi.


40 :

{T1B025}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, eh? Nice to meet you, Kuranari.

[Takeshi]
Good to know you, Y¤u.


41 :
[Girl]
.........

The whole time, the girl in the dark clothes
silently watched our exchange.


42 :
We went down the stairs together.

Me, £o¢o, Y¤u, Sora, the kid, the girl in
black, six of us total...


43 :
We arrived at Dritter Stock‡Lthe third floor
underwater.


44 :
We used the ladder in the emergency corridor
to descend to another corridor and turned
around the corner.


45 :
'Kontrollzentrum'

It seemed that it was the central control
room.


46 :

{T1B026}
[Y¤u]
"What do you think? Can you learn anything 
from the computers here?"


{T1B027}
[Sora]
"Let's see. It looks like directly accessing 
it would be the fastest route."


47 :
Sora faced the monitor and held up both hands.


48 :
Instantly, the content of the screen began to
change, with a number of windows opening and
closing while the search for data was underway.


49 :
[Takeshi]
"Hey... you can operate these computers 
without even touching them?"

[Takeshi]
"I've got the latest cell phone, and it's 
got a touch panel."

[Takeshi]
And it's got a kinetic recharge function...


50 :

{T1B028}
[£o¢o]
What's that?

[Takeshi]
"Huh? Oh, it means that even if the battery 
dies, if you walk around with it or shake it, 
it'll recharge itself. It takes a while, though."

I took my PDA from my pocket and loaned it to
£o¢o.


51 :

{T1B029}
[£o¢o]
Like this?

£o¢o took the PDA and shook it using short
movements like she was shaking maracas.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, like that.

The light that indicated the battery had
died lit up.


52 :

{T1B030}
[£o¢o]
Oh, you're right.

[Takeshi]
"The harder you shake it, the more it lights 
up."

The lamp flickered.

I didn't know if she was having fun or what,
but £o¢o kept up her maraca act for a while.


53 :
It looked like the PDA wasn't broken. All I
had to do was wait and it would probably work
again.

It seemed the professional diving waterproof
specifications it had boasted were actually
true.

[Sora]
........


54 :
Sora typed quietly on the keyboard.

(Huh?)

She was typing on the keyboard, but...

It looked like her hands weren't even
touching the keyboard. I figured that was my
imagination.


55 :

{T1B031}
[Sora]
...I've learned something.

Sora said it in a businesslike manner. She
seemed done with the computer.

Everyone looked in her direction.


{T1B032}
[Sora]
Everyone, please be calm.

As she said that, I noticed she looked a
little pale.

The room went quiet as the focus shifted to
her.


56 :

{T1B033}
[Sora]
First, the first floor, Erster Boden...


{T1B034}
[Sora]
"The whole floor is flooded, except for one 
segment of stairs."


{T1B035}
[Y¤u]
Flooded? The whole first floor?


{T1B036}
[Sora]
"Yes. All of the partitions have dropped, and 
it isn't possible to get through any of its 
corridors."


{T1B037}
[Girl]
In other words... there's no way up.


{T1B038}
[Sora]
That is correct.

[Takeshi]
...


{T1B039}
[Sora]
And as for Zweiter Stock and Dritter Stock...


{T1B040}
[Sora]
"The watertight doors did not close in time,
and Sector Three is completely flooded."


57 :

{T1B041}
[Sora]
"All other sectors on the other floors are 
currently fine."


{T1B042}
[Sora]
"However, some rooms do have water from the 
flood we just experienced."


{T1B043}
[Sora]
"Currently, the bilge pumps are functioning, 
but it will take a lot of time for the water 
to completely drain."


{T1B044}
[Y¤u]
Bilge pumps?


{T1B045}
[£o¢o]
Does that mean that we have electricity?


{T1B046}
[Sora]
Let's see...


{T1B901}
[Sora]
"Some electrical systems, including the 
elevators, are not functioning."

{T1B902}
[Sora]
"The cause of this is unclear, 
but it would seem that circuit damage 
in each section is playing a role."

{T1B048}
[Sora]
"That is another reason that I was not able 
to survey the situation adequately before."

(What does she mean 'she' wasn't able to...?)

Something about her words nagged at my mind,
but I listened to the rest of what she had to
say.


{T1B049}
[Sora]
"However, the generator is functioning 
normally and supplying power."


{T1B050}
[Sora]
"So as long as the generator is operating as 
well as the circuitry, the water should be 
cleared with time."


{T1B051}
[Sora]
"Incidentally, the internal air pressure of 
the complex is one atmosphere."


{T1B052}
[Sora]
"The air is 22% oxygen, 75% 
nitrogen, and 3% helium. The 
temperature is 24 degrees Celsius..."


{T1B053}
[Girl]
"So what you're basically saying is we're 
safe for a while, right?"


{T1B054}
[Sora]
I'm sorry, but that is the current situation...


{T1B055}
[Sora]
"Everyone, we will be forced to wait 
inside the complex for a while."


58 :
[Takeshi]
For a while? How long is that?


{T1B056}
[Sora]
Until help comes.


{T1B057}
[Sora]
"I am continuously sending out a request for 
assistance. However..."


{T1B058}
[Sora]
"Right now, there is no guarantee that it will 
reach anyone."


{T1B059}
[Sora]
"All communication lines to Insel Null, 
including the emergency ones, have been 
physically severed and are unusable."


{T1B060}
[Sora]
"I have also been attempting to make contact 
via a seafloor cable network, using sonar..."


{T1B061}
[Sora]
"Right now, I cannot estimate when the network 
will be back online."

[Takeshi]
"So we're like little kids lost smack in the 
middle of the ocean, and nobody can hear our 
SOS..."


{T1B062}
[Sora]
Exactly.


59 :
The gravity of the situation was
descending on us.

There was every reason for everyone to get
depressed.

I sighed...


60 :

{T1B063}
[Y¤u]
Alright! We've got to stay in good spirits!

One of the group was determined to dispel the
gloomy atmosphere.

Y¤u spoke so fast that it was almost scary.


{T1B064}
[Y¤u]
"I'm a first year student at Kyumeikan Women's 
College, and I work here part-time. My name is 
Tanaka Yubiseiharukana. I will be your guide 
until the rescue team comes."


{T1B065}
[Y¤u]
Rap-tap-tap-tap~ Ta-da~

[Takeshi]
...Hey, wait, wait! What did you just say?


61 :

{T1B066}
[Y¤u]
I'm a freshman at Kyumeikan Women's College.


{T1B067}
[Y¤u]
"I work here part-time and only over the 
holidays."


62 :

{T1B068}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I'm kind of new to this whole tour 
thing, but I will be leading the tour..."

[Takeshi]
No, no. After that.


63 :

{T1B069}
[Y¤u]
Huh? You mean my name?


64 :

{T1B070}
[Y¤u]
Tanaka Yubiseiharukana.

[Takeshi]
Yubise... what?


{T1B071}
[Y¤u]
Tanaka Yubiseiharukana.

[Takeshi]
I can't get my tongue around that.


65 :

{T1B072}
[Y¤u]
"That's why I said you can call me 'Y¤u'. The 
long name is a pain, isn't it?"


{T1B073}
[£o¢o]
Hey, I have a question.


66 :
Another gloom destroyer appeared...


{T1B074}
[Y¤u]
What might that be?


67 :

{T1B075}
[£o¢o]
Can I call you 'Nakkyu'?


68 :

{T1B076}
[Y¤u]
Yes, please do. And what is your name?


{T1B077}
[£o¢o]
Yagami £o¢o!


{T1B078}
[£o¢o]
And this is Pipi!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!

Her pet dog appeared from nowhere.

Boy, was she full of energy. Leave it to
elementary school kids...


69 :

{T1B079}
[Y¤u]
And how old are you?


{T1B080}
[£o¢o]
I'm in ninth grade.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what?


70 :

{T1B081}
[£o¢o]
What? What's the matter?

[Takeshi]
No... it's nothing...

It seemed the surprises would never cease.


71 :

{T1B082}
[Y¤u]
Okay, nice to meet you, £o¢o and Pipi!


72 :

{T1B083}
[£o¢o]
Thank you~


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!


73 :

{T1B084}
[Y¤u]
What a cute dog!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


74 :

{T1B085}
[Y¤u]
And so smart too!


{T1B086}
[£o¢o]
I think so too.

I wondered if maybe there wasn't enough
oxygen in the room...

I was getting a headache...


75 :
[Girl]
...

The girl in the black clothes gave our upbeat
companions a cool stare.

Y¤u noticed the look.


76 :

{T1B087}
[Y¤u]
Uh, and how about you over there?

[Takeshi]
Huh? Why're you asking me?


77 :

{T1B088}
[Y¤u]
Aren't you together?

[Takeshi]
Stupid. What are you talking about?


78 :

{T1B089}
[Y¤u]
Hmmmm...

[Takeshi]
What's that supposed to mean?


79 :

{T1B090}
[Tsugumi]
Tsugumi.


80 :
I realized the girl had spoken.


{T1B091}
[Tsugumi]
Komachi Tsugumi.

It was just loud enough to make out what she
was saying.


81 :

{T1B092}
[Tsugumi]
That's my name...


82 :

{T1B093}
[Y¤u]
Hi, Tsugumi! Nice to meet you!


83 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


84 :
She turned her back. Y¤u shrugged slightly.


85 :
I thought Tsugumi might have been embarrassed.

There was something kinda cute about her.

(Tsugumi, Tsugumi...)

(I think that's a bird's name...)

I remembered her tugging me along in the
aquarium and running like the wind.

86 :
{11:0-83}
{11:1}Thanks for helping back there

{11:1}What are you so mad about?


87 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi... Thanks for helping back there.

I walked over to her and said that.


88 :

{T1B094}
[Tsugumi]
What are you talking about?

[Takeshi]
You saved me in the aquarium, right?


{T1B095}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't mean to save you.


{T1B096}
[Tsugumi]
You were in the way.

[Takeshi]
...What?


{T1B097}
[Tsugumi]
"If you had tumbled there, you would have 
been in the way."


89 :

{T1B098}
[Tsugumi]
I mean you were an obstacle.

Tsugumi looked annoyed as she said that.


90 :
[Takeshi]
What are you so mad about?

I walked over to her and said that.


91 :

{T1B099}
[Tsugumi]
This is how I am normally.

[Takeshi]
I won't ask you to pretend to be happy...

[Takeshi]
"But how about being a little more friendly? 
We're gonna have to put up with each other 
until we get outta here."


{T1B100}
[Tsugumi]
Why?


{T1B101}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't know any of you. We just happen to 
all be here together."


{T1B102}
[Tsugumi]
"That's right, we don't have any connection to 
each other..."


92 :

{T1B103}
[Tsugumi]
We're just an unlucky gathering of strangers.

Tsugumi looked annoyed as she said that.


93 :
(This chick's intense! And scary...!)

In my mind, I retracted my earlier thoughts
about her being cute.

Tsugumi and I glared at each other for a while.


94 :

{T1B104}
[Y¤u]
Hey, hey! You two! Let's get along now!

Y¤u jumped in between us.


95 :
I walked away from Tsugumi, and she looked
away from me.


96 :

{T1B105}
[Y¤u]
Sora, it's your turn to introduce yourself.


97 :
Y¤u, who was totally in control of the
situation, turned to Sora, who was working on
the computer.


{T1B106}
[Sora]
Oh, you mean me?

Sora took her hands from the machine and came
toward us as if she were gliding.


98 :

{T1B107}
[Sora]
"Pardon me for the belated introduction. I am 
Akanegasaki Sora. I am a system engineer in 
LeMU's Development Division."


{T1B108}
[Sora]
Basically... the assistant chief.

99 :
{11:0-85}
{11:1}...Is that right?

{11:1}Assistant chief...


100 :
(...Is that right?)

But something struck me as strange.

Actually, it had been bothering me since
before...

'Basically... the assistant chief.'

She spoke about herself as if she were
someone else.

'I was not able to gauge the situation.'

She spoke as if the problems in the system
were her own.

'Please do excuse me.'

(System engineer... I wonder if she talks like
that because of her job?)

That was what I thought... but I held my tongue.

[Takeshi]
"...I'm Kuranari Takeshi. I'm 20 years old 
and a junior in college. Thanks."


{T1B109}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, nice to meet you.


{T1B110}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, it sure is!


101 :
[Takeshi]
"Assistant chief... So you're pretty 
high up?"


{T1B111}
[Sora]
"Only in name. I'm really just an 
assistant. It's no big deal."

[Takeshi]
"But hey, Sora, weren't you up at the gate 
above ground?"

[Takeshi]
"You were giving some kind of explanation at 
the entrance, right? I only heard half of it, 
but..."


102 :

{T1B112}
[£o¢o]
"Oh, you might be right. Are you the girl from 
before?"


103 :

{T1B113}
[Sora]
That's right. So you noticed...


104 :

{T1B114}
[Sora]
"We are short of people here. From time to 
time, I do that kind of work."

Sora smiled.

[Takeshi]
Uh, I'm Kuranari Takeshi.

[Takeshi]
I'm 20. I'm a junior in college.


105 :

{T1B115}
[£o¢o]
Nice to meet you!


106 :

{T1B116}
[Sora]
Yes. Nice to meet you.


107 :

{T1B117}
[Y¤u]
Yup. Mucho gusto.

Everyone laughed cheerfully.


{T1B118}
[Tsugumi]
...Hmph.

Everyone except Tsugumi...

It took a little effort, but the atmosphere
finally loosened up.

Y¤u started gathering us up.


{T1B119}
[Y¤u]
Okay now, everyone!


108 :

{T1B120}
[Y¤u]
"Now that we've just started having so much 
fun, it's time to say goodbye‡L"


109 :

{T1B121}
[£o¢o]
Uh, Nakkyu! Wait a second!


{T1B122}
[£o¢o]
We haven't asked somebody's name yet.

£o¢o pointed to the corner of the room.


110 :

{T1B123}
[Kid]
Uh... Do you mean me?


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

We'd completely forgotten him.

He'd been quiet the whole time, trying to
stay out of the way, and mostly kept to the
corner of the room.


111 :
[Y¤u]
.........

Y¤u looked at the boy, and it looked like her
face stiffened a little.


112 :

{T1B124}
[£o¢o]
So let's ask...


113 :

{T1B126}
[£o¢o]
What is your name?

£o¢o tilted her head as she asked him the
question.


114 :
[Kid]
.........


{T1B127}
[Kid]
I...


115 :

{T1B128}
[Kid]
My...

[Kid]
.........

He looked down.

I couldn't figure out what he was waiting for...


116 :

{T1B129}
[Kid]
I...


117 :

{T1B130}
[Kid]
Who am I...?


118 :

{T1B131}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
What?


{T1B132}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


{T1B133}
[Sora]
...?


119 :

{T1B134}
[Kid]
I can't remember...


{T1B135}
[Kid]
My... name...

[Takeshi]
Maybe you've got amnesia.


120 :
Memory impairment: Erinnerungsstörung


121 :
Amnesia:

Refers to memories lost for a certain period
of time. It is more common with new memories
than with old memories.

During the period of memory loss, if the
person has no memories at all, it is called
'complete amnesia', but in instances in which
some memories can be recalled, it is called
'partial amnesia'.

{16:4}

122 :
Generally, amnesia results from trauma to the
head, epileptic seizures, mental diseases, and
disorders that manifest themselves as memory
impairments.

When a person has trouble recollecting events
prior to the impairment, it is known as
'retrograde amnesia'. If new memories cannot
be formed after the onset of the impairment, it
is known as 'anterograde amnesia'.


{16:4}

123 :
Amnesia caused by inherent mental factors is
referred to as 'organic amnesia', while that
induced by psychological stress is typically
known as 'psychogenic amnesia', with 'hysterical
amnesia' being the most typical example.

This is an affliction in which the victim
often cannot recall knowledge relating to his
or her personal history, such as one's name,
history, family, or friends...

And is often a reaction to incidents too hard
to endure: those which incite an unconscious desire
to escape, forget, or repress those
experiences or events.

{16:4}

124 :
Symptoms do not manifest in any particular way
physically, and a person's brain function
remains normal.

People found wandering in this state are
often taken in or seek help from authorities,
such as the police.

{16:4}



125 :
Young people in their twenties under severe
psychological stress, such as those facing
domestic violence, academic problems,
marriage issues, or financial difficulties, are the
most typical victims. However, this illness
can be used as a cover for criminal
activities, and it can be difficult to detect
the difference.

{16:4}

126 :
This is especially seen in individuals with
demonstrative personalities or pathological
tendencies to lie.

Normally, in a few days or months, or with the
help of hypnosis or shock therapy, the
memories should return.

Complete amnesia can be spurred by retrograde
life amnesia. Memories are usually restored
gradually, beginning with older ones, and
treatment methods include psychiatric care
and hypnosis, both narcotic and naturally
induced.

{16:4}

127 :
[Takeshi]
Amnesia?


{T1B136}
[Y¤u]
That's right... He can't remember anything.


{T1B137}
[Sora]
Did you suffer a concussion?


{T1B138}
[Sora]
"You might have bumped your head severely 
somewhere."

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, you coulda taken a tumble... like when 
trying to escape."


{T1B139}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmph...

Tsugumi had let loose a nasty snort when I
said 'tumble'.


{T1B140}
[Kid]
I don't know... I don't remember anything.


{T1B141}
[Kid]
Hey. Where is this?


{T1B142}
[Y¤u]
We are in LeMU, a marine theme park.


{T1B143}
[Kid]
Lay... myu...?


128 :
The kid glanced at £o¢o.

He tilted his head.


129 :
£o¢o was playing rock, paper, scissors with
her dog, Pipi...


130 :
We moved to a room with a kiosk in it.

Thankfully, at least the electric drink
dispenser was working.

Each person poured the drink they wanted in a
paper cup.


131 :

{T1B144}
[Y¤u]
"For now, let's just make a toast and a 
prayer to everyone's safety!"


132 :

{T1B145}
[£o¢o]
Cheers!

[Takeshi]
Okay then. Cheers.


133 :

{T1B146}
[Kid]
Ch-cheers.


134 :
[Tsugumi]
...


135 :
The string of events leading to the sudden
toast went something like...

'Hey, kid, don't you know anything about
before?'

'Not even something personal about yourself?'

'What do I know... Oh!'

'I know... I'm kinda thirsty.'

‡LAnd that was how it started.

But reason aside, we needed a breather, so the
timing was good.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, Sora, what about you? Don't you want a 
drink?"

Sora was standing stiffly.


136 :

{T1B147}
[Sora]
Uh, no thanks. I'm not thirsty.

[Takeshi]
"Well, how about taking a load off? You've been 
standing the whole time."


{T1B148}
[Sora]
I'm fine. But thanks for your concern.


137 :
Sure... I thought.

Sora seemed older than me. She seemed polite
and serious.

She seemed the typical Japanese woman.

'Prim and proper' could be one way of
describing Sora.

I looked around at my surroundings.

Y¤u was next to the kid and chatting with him.

Sometimes, he would laugh or shake his head
weakly.

I could overhear bits of their conversation.
They were talking about his memory.


{T1B149}
[Y¤u]
It's not that out of the ordinary.


{T1B150}
[Y¤u]
You'll be fine. It'll fix itself in time.

It looked like the two of them were drinking
orange juice.

Tsugumi was a way off from everyone and
looking into the distance.

I had no idea what she was drinking.

I didn't have any idea what she was thinking
either.

After agonizing over whether to drink apple
juice or cocoa, £o¢o finally decided on both.

But she proceeded to forget about her drink
immediately, and £o¢o took a hold of Pipi's
front legs and started dancing around.

It was a cute scene...

After things had calmed down, Y¤u and everyone else
gathered in front of the kiosk.


138 :

{T1B151}
[Y¤u]
"It looks like we're going to be in LeMU for a while...
so there are a few things I would like to go over."


{T1B152}
[Y¤u]
First, what's happened.


{T1B153}
[Y¤u]
Next, what we should do now.


139 :

{T1B154}
[Sora]
"Tanaka-san, would you mind if I addressed the
first of those topics?"


{T1B155}
[Y¤u]
Please do, Sora.


140 :
Sora stood in front of everyone and held out
her arms.


141 :
Suddenly, a holographic window materialized
in the air.

I had no idea how the whole system worked,
but I figured that it was the same one they
had used at the entrance to the park.


142 :

{T1B156}
[Sora]
I will explain...

And then she said...


143 :
12:45 p.m.‡L

A blackout suddenly occurred, cause unknown.

Next, the emergency alarms began ringing.
The cause of this was also unknown.

{16:4}

144 :
12:54 p.m.‡L

The Insel Null elevator shifted to its
emergency power source, and an evacuation
order was issued for the entire complex.
Employees and visitors evacuated the premises.

{16:4}

145 :
At this point, some people panicked and opened
the emergency corridor to the outside in their confusion
without going through decompression.
It is highly probable that they are
experiencing serious decompression sickness
at this moment.

The emergency corridor to the outside was
left open for several minutes.

{16:4}

146 :
1:03 p.m.‡L

The opening of the emergency corridor disrupted
the air pressure balance inside the
complex, and the devices responsible for
adjusting the air pressure encountered
problems. The complex started automatically
pulling in air from the outside.

{16:4}

147 :
As a result, the mixture of gas in the complex
designed to maintain six atmospheres of air
pressure escaped.

Apparently helium, which is lighter than
oxygen or nitrogen, leaked out first.

Air pressure in the complex dropped to one
atmosphere, the same as the level outside.

{16:4}

148 :
2:39 p.m.‡L

The major power source came back online.
LeMMIH, the computer system responsible for
overseeing LeMU, rebooted and reset the air
pressure adjustment mechanism. The air
ventilation ducts were closed.

However, LeMU was built to saturation diving
specifications, meaning that as long as the
internal air pressure was the same level or
higher than the outside water pressure, it
was designed not to collapse.

Which meant...

{16:4}

149 :
3:55 p.m.‡L

When the internal air pressure dropped to one
atmosphere, it became impossible for the
external partitions to withstand the external
water pressure, causing the glass to crack
under the pressure, thus resulting in flooding.

Subsequently, to minimize the damage from the
flooding, the emergency watertight doors had
automatically shut.

Which brought us up to speed.

{16:4}

150 :
.........


{T1B157}
[Sora]
"I would like to be able to gauge the current 
situation more accurately... however, some 
monitors and sensors are still not 
functioning normally."


{T1B158}
[Sora]
"As a result, I can't obtain accurate data 
and can only provide an outline of the 
situation..."

[Takeshi]
"Hey, sorry to ask you the same question 
again, but..."

[Takeshi]
The first floor... above us is flooded, yeah?


151 :

{T1B159}
[Sora]
"Correct. I have requested confirmation from 
our complex management system, LeMMIH, and it 
has been confirmed."

[Takeshi]
So we can't get outta here.


{T1B160}
[Sora]
"Currently, the top priority is requesting 
assistance, so I am doing my utmost to get the 
communications system back online. I must 
request your patience..."


152 :
Sora bowed her head.

I was feeling depressed again.

I didn't want to admit it, but we were in deep
trouble.


153 :

{T1B161}
[Y¤u]
"Well, all we can do for now is just wait for 
help, right?"

[Takeshi]
"You just keep trying to make everyone feel 
better, don't you?"


154 :

{T1B162}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, I'm sorry. Would you prefer my dark, 
despondent, and desperate approach?"

[Takeshi]
That's not what I'm saying...


155 :

{T1B163}
[Y¤u]
Anyway, how about another drink?

Y¤u came out with a huge industrial-sized
bottle and held it up comically.

[Takeshi]
"I just can't get over how cheerful you are 
given how totally screwed we are."

I complained again without thinking.


156 :

{T1B164}
[Y¤u]
"I said that's not it at all. I'm like this 
precisely BECAUSE of the situation."

Y¤u said that with a bit of a sulk.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, you're right... Sorry.


157 :

{T1B165}
[Y¤u]
There's no need to apologize. Here you go.


158 :
Glup, glup, glup...

She filled my cup to the brim with juice.


[Takeshi]
Hey, hey...


159 :
Sluuuuuuuurp.

But most of it was just bubbles.

[Takeshi]
This is good!


160 :

{T1B166}
[Y¤u]
Isn't it?


161 :
Sluuuuuuuurp.

[Takeshi]
Thanks for the juice.


162 :

{T1B167}
[Y¤u]
Any time. And it's on the house.


163 :
Y¤u shouldered the massive bottle and took it
back inside the shop.

Carrying it, she teetered like a penguin,
which was funny because it really didn't suit
her.

(Geez, she's a funny one...)

I laughed without thinking.


164 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi was leaning against the shop wall and
staring after Y¤u.

Her face was expressionless.

I wondered what she was thinking...

I had no idea.

[Takeshi]
Even if we are going to wait for help...

[Takeshi]
"We can't just sit on our butts doing nothing. 
Right?"

I casually tried to strike up a conversation
with Tsugumi.


165 :

{T1B168}
[Tsugumi]
You...


{T1B169}
[Tsugumi]
"You act like you're all serious, but there's 
really nothing going on in that head of yours, 
is there?"

[Takeshi]
What? That's not true!

[Takeshi]
I'm thinking. I'm always thinking.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. I was just thinking of a way to keep 
us from getting bored..."

I rattled off the first thing that jumped to
mind.


166 :

{T1B170}
[Tsugumi]
...Sure. Whatever.

Tsugumi gave me an annoyed look.


167 :
She seemed exasperated...

I didn't want her to expect anything from me,
but her attitude was frustrating.

[Takeshi]
Arrghh...

[Takeshi]
Hey! Alright, everyone, listen up.

I had an idea.

I called to everybody.


168 :

{T1B171}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?


169 :

{T1B172}
[£o¢o]
What?


170 :

{T1B173}
[Sora]
What's the matter, Kuranari-san?


171 :

{T1B174}
[Y¤u]
What? What? What happened?


172 :

{T1B175}
[Kid]
...?

Everybody gathered around.

[Takeshi]
"We're not gonna accomplish anything just 
spending time like this, right?"

[Takeshi]
"So I just thought, why don't we all split up 
and look around the complex?"


173 :

{T1B176}
[Sora]
"Why? Don't you think that staying in one 
place would be safer?"

[Takeshi]
"No. I think we should check to see if 
'staying in one place' and doing nothing is 
really the safest thing to do."

[Takeshi]
"You know, walk around, see what we can find, 
and scope out any dangers..."

[Takeshi]
"If we find some, we can tell everyone to 
watch out for them or do something to get rid 
of them."

[Takeshi]
"And we can see if there is a safer 
place... and then we could all gather there."


{T1B177}
[Sora]
But Kuranari-san...

[Takeshi]
"It's not like the rescue squad is about to 
burst in the door."

[Takeshi]
"So if we're going to have to be here in LeMU 
for half a day or a day or so, then..."

[Takeshi]
"We should find out what kinda place this is 
and get to know it like our own house."


174 :

{T1B178}
[Sora]
"In that case, I can provide you with an 
abundance of information..."

[Takeshi]
"No, that's not what I mean. Listen. Sora, you 
have to look after the communications 
network, right?"

[Takeshi]
"You were just talking about how some sensors 
or monitors weren't working right and you 
can't get a full sense of the current 
situation."


175 :

{T1B179}
[Y¤u]
Oh, I see.

Y¤u clapped her hands together.


176 :

{T1B180}
[Y¤u]
"So while Sora is trying to send an SOS, we 
should use our own two legs to see what kind 
of a situation we're in."


177 :

{T1B181}
[Y¤u]
"How about it? Sora, that would be easier on 
you, wouldn't it?"


178 :

{T1B182}
[Sora]
"Yes... I suppose it would. But there are 
still dangers..."

It seemed that Sora was unsure.


179 :

{T1B183}
[Tsugumi]
Alright, I'll go then.


180 :
Tsugumi suddenly laughed.

It looked like she was laughing, but her lips
curled nastily.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi! Where are you going?


181 :

{T1B184}
[Tsugumi]
"We're going to split up and check things 
out, right?"

Tsugumi's expression was blank again.


182 :
Turning around, she headed for the entrance to
the emergency corridor.

[Takeshi]
Hey, you can't just...

[Takeshi]
Come back here! Hey, idiot!


183 :
She was already out of sight.

Her shoes clacked on the metal stairs as she
climbed.


184 :

{T1B185}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin is gone. What are we going to do?


{T1B186}
[Sora]
I'm worried...

Sora's brow furrowed and her expression
stiffened.


185 :

{T1B187}
[Kid]
I think it's alright.


186 :
The kid had broken his silence, and I was a
little surprised.


{T1B188}
[Kid]
"It's like Takeshi says. It doesn't do us any 
good to just stay here..."

He continued without pausing.


{T1B189}
[Kid]
"Tsugumi just went to the second floor. I'll 
bet she's just going to look around there."


{T1B190}
[Kid]
So why don't we look around the third floor?


187 :

{T1B191}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...


188 :

{T1B192}
[Y¤u]
Alright then. I'm in.


189 :

{T1B193}
[£o¢o]
Okay. Let's do that then.

[Takeshi]
Sounds like a plan...

I gave a big nod.


190 :

{T1B194}
[Sora]
"I suppose there is nothing I can do to stop 
you. Please, be careful, everyone."

Sora finally nodded slightly.

Once everyone's minds were set, things picked
up.


191 :
Sora said she was going back to the control
room to get data, so we went our separate ways.

Y¤u, £o¢o, the kid, and I went to search
around the complex.


192 :
We decided to check the normal corridors and
the emergency corridors above and below them
on the third floor.

Splitting into pairs where the corridor
forked, we agreed to meet back at the fork
when we had checked the corridor ahead...

We did that over and over.


193 :
We walked every corridor that we could walk
down.

I wondered if water was leaking anywhere.

I figured that the water pressure would send
water spurting through any crack it could find.


194 :
Also, I thought there might be other people
who had been left behind.

According to Sora, the system had told her
that there were six people in the complex.
Still, there was no guarantee that was right.

I thought that if we found somebody else, it
might change our situation.


195 :
There could also have been a corridor that the
broken sensors weren't picking up.

I hoped there might be a door to the surface
that we were simply unaware of... I couldn't
throw away that shred of hope.


196 :
While we were out searching, Sora continued
to try to get into contact with LeMU's
central computer, LeMMIH, and gather more
information.

Sora had said that she wanted to establish a
means of communicating with the outside.


197 :
We returned to the front of the kiosk. Sora had
arrived first and was waiting.

But Tsugumi was nowhere to be seen.


{T1B195}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi hasn't come back.

[Takeshi]
"We can't just let her run loose... I wonder 
where she is."


{T1B196}
[Sora]
Shall I check?


198 :
We all went into the central control room.


199 :

{T1B197}
[Sora]
"We checked the life reading scan of people 
inside the complex. Even if Komachi-san were 
moving around, she should still appear in the 
results of the scan."


{T1B198}
[Sora]
That is, of course, if she is in the complex...


200 :
(And if she is alive...)

I managed to keep that thought from coming
out of my mouth.

It only took a moment for a map of LeMU and
data from the sensors to appear.

There was one fuzzy light on the second floor.


{T1B199}
[Sora]
That would be Komachi-san...

There were a number of lights in a room on
the third floor. I figured that was the
control room where we were.


201 :

{T1B200}
[Kid]
Oh!


202 :

{T1B201}
[Y¤u]
What is it?


203 :

{T1B202}
[Kid]
Hey, isn't that strange?


{T1B203}
[Kid]
Look...


204 :
The kid pointed at a corner of the monitor.

It indicated a single digit number.


205 :
'Life readings: 6'


{T1B204}
[Kid]
Watch it closely...


206 :
'Life readings: 5'


207 :
'Life readings: 7'


208 :
'Life readings: 6'


209 :
5

210 :
7

211 :
6

212 :
5

213 :
7

214 :
6...


215 :

{T1B205}
[Sora]
"Oh my. You're right... I wonder what it 
could be..."


216 :
Sora fiddled with the console, but the
numbers on the monitor continued to fluctuate.


217 :
The number changed every few seconds.


218 :
But even while the life scan numbers changed,
no new lights appeared or disappeared.


219 :

{T1B206}
[Kid]
Maybe...


{T1B207}
[Kid]
Maybe there is somebody besides us in LeMU.


{T1B208}
[Kid]
"If the number really is supposed to be 
'seven'..."


{T1B209}
[Y¤u]
That's what it would mean.


{T1B210}
[Kid]
"Don't you think we should go look for that 
person?"


220 :

{T1B211}
[Kid]
"I mean... they could be in trouble. We have 
to help them!"

[Takeshi]
Hang on, kid. Calm down.


221 :
For a while, all of our eyes were glued to the
changing numbers.

Watching them change was unsettling...

Finally...


222 :
'Life readings: 6'

The monitor settled on the number six.

The light on the second floor was moving
around slowly.

The five lights on the third floor were all
in one room, unmoving.


223 :

{T1B212}
[Sora]
"Perhaps it... was just because of a 
malfunctioning sensor. The cause is unclear. 
Would you like to see what else we can find 
out?"

[Takeshi]
"Nah. Tsugumi's on the second floor, and there 
are five of us here..."

[Takeshi]
"So that number 'six' is probably right. Don't 
you think?"


{T1B213}
[Kid]
But...

[Takeshi]
"Well, I figure if we go look around a little 
more, we'll find out soon enough."

[Kid]
.........


{T1B214}
[Y¤u]
...Yeah.

[Takeshi]
Alright then.

[Takeshi]
"So do you all wanna head to the second 
floor...?"

I thought it was best if we actually took in
the situation with our own eyes.


224 :
We climbed to the top of the long emergency
stairs together.

In the end, we didn't find anybody else on
the third floor.

We didn't see any routes that looked like
they might lead out either.

Sora had told us there was no schedule for the
communications system to be back online.

We could look at the information displayed on
some of the LeMMIH terminals which were set
in some attractions and in the corridors, but
we couldn't operate them in any way.

The cause for that was unclear too.

The fact that there were no leaks on that
floor was our one saving grace.
