4 :
I was in the middle of a blue world.

Headed back to the mainland...

There was nobody on the boat other than us.

Me, Hokuto, Tsugumi, Yubiseiharukana, Sora,
£o¢o, Kaburaki, Chami, Pipi...

Oh, and two girls called Tanaka
Yubisei'aki'kana and Matsunaga Sara...

Nine people and two animals altogether.

I slipped a short distance away from
everyone and leaned over the deck
railing to look out at the expanse of ocean
before me.

The May sun sparkled on the ocean.

Above, high above, stretched a clear blue sky.


The fresh new sky looked so glossy and vivid
that it might spill down to Earth at any
moment.

That was all that was reflected in my eyes.

The straight line of the horizon stretched into
the distance, dividing the sea from the
heavens.


{EOP000}
[Takeshi]
So tranquil...

I murmured to myself.

A solitary seagull traced a gentle arc in the
sky as the wind carried it away.

The wind, carrying the ocean's scent, blew
by me gently.


{EOP001}
[Takeshi]
So peaceful...

It was as if it was in a dream...

Everything that I saw in the scene before me
was exactly as it had been six days earlier.

Six days earlier...

For me, it had only been six days.

Not even a week had passed.

I had gotten separated from my friends that day...

And ended up waiting by myself for an
elevator...

But... after surviving for six days, I had been
sucked seventeen years into the future...

And...


5 :

{CEP000}
[Sara]
Hey, hey! Dad, Dad~


{CEP001}
[Hokuto]
Daaaad! Dad!

I found out that I had a sixteen-year-old daughter
and son...

‡LIt was a dream.

Yeah, that was right, I had to be dreaming!

If I wasn't dreaming, there was no way it could
be happening!


{CEP002}
[Sara]
Hey! Daaaad! Listen!

The girl called Sara pulled up close to me.

The girl was wearing a high school uniform
I'd never seen before. She suddenly grabbed me
and pressed her cheek against my arm.


[Takeshi]
.........


6 :

{CEP003}
[Sara]
Hey, look! Look at this...


{CEP004}
[Sara]
"You know? I've been watching you ever since 
I was a little baby girl."


7 :
Sara stuck out a pendant with a mirror
attached to it.

On the mirror side, there was nothing.

But...


8 :

{CEP005}
[Takeshi]
Oh, really...?


{CEP006}
[Takeshi]
"I don't really understand, but that's okay, 
daughter of mine!"


{CEP007}
[Takeshi]
I can't believe how tall you've gotten!


9 :
Saying that, I stroked her hair.

Since I had come that far, I decided there
was no reason to hold back.

Besides, all of it was a dream...

And if I had such a cute daughter, what did
it matter anyway?

There was no reason to resist the whole
situation... And as I was thinking that...


10 :

{CEP008}
[Hokuto]
Hey! Dad, no fair!


{CEP009}
[Hokuto]
And you kept telling me, 'Don't call me Dad!'


{CEP010}
[Hokuto]
How come you act fatherly with Sara!?

[Takeshi]
.........


11 :

{CEP011}
[Sara]
Hey, Dad? Daaad?


{CEP012}
[Sara]
"I want to go to Ninja Town for fun someday 
soon~"


{CEP013}
[Takeshi]
Ninja Town, eh...?


{CEP014}
[Takeshi]
Why not? Sounds good to me.


12 :

{CEP015}
[Hokuto]
Hey! Stop ignoring me!


{CEP016}
[Hokuto]
"How come you listen to everything Sara 
says!?"


{CEP017}
[Hokuto]
Why don't you listen to a thing I say?


{CEP018}
[Hokuto]
Well, Dad? Why not?


{CEP019}
[Takeshi]
...I'm not ignoring you.


{CEP020}
[Takeshi]
"I just don't want to answer those kinds of 
questions..."


13 :

{CEP021}
[Hokuto]
Those kinds of questions?


{CEP022}
[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{CEP023}
[Takeshi]
I don't answer meaningless questions.


14 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}‡LKomachi Tsugumi‡L{16:1}


15 :

{16:4}

16 :

{CEP023}
[Takeshi]
I don't answer meaningless questions.

I could hear his words coming from a
distance, the same words I used to say seventeen
years before.

In order to protect myself from the strong
May sunshine, I stayed inside the boat.

I could see the three of them through the
window.

Takeshi was on the deck over by the railing,
talking to the two kids.

'I don't answer meaningless questions.'

Yes...

That was why I always kept quiet whenever he
asked me something.

There was so much I wanted to talk about.

I wanted to tell him about every single day
that had passed in those long seventeen years.

But for the time being...

Like that, watching him innocently
playing with the children... that alone... was enough
for me.

Everything that had happened up until that
point was meaningless.

He was there... right in front of me... and the
two children were there...

There was nothing more I could have hoped for.

I had found happiness. I was immersed in it,
drowning in it, intoxicated by it.

That was truly how I felt.

It seemed to me that all of the days filled
with struggle and sadness had been for that
day, that moment...

Hokuto and Sara were on both sides of him,
and even when he tried to throw them off,
they clung to him.

I absently petted Chami, who was riding on my
shoulder, as I watched the scene before me.

Him‡LKuranari Takeshi.


17 :

{C7A152}
[Takeshi]
So live!


{C7A153}
[Takeshi]
As long as you're alive, live!


{C7A154}
[Takeshi]
Don't worry...


{C7A155}
[Takeshi]
I...


{C7A156}
[Takeshi]
I'm not going to die.


18 :
And after saying that, he jumped from our
'taxi', that stupid man.

Stupid man...

But... he kept his promise.

So there was something I had to tell him.


Going outside... wrapped in my '100% UV
protective clothing', I...


19 :
I walked over to where he was.

For some reason, my legs were shaking, and my
heart was beating so hard it felt like it
would burst.

Being careful that he wouldn't notice the deep
breaths I was taking, I went and stood in
front of him.


20 :

{CEP024}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


{CEP025}
[Tsugumi]
Welcome home.


21 :
Suddenly, he pulled me close.

Into his strong arms and solid chest...

My body was wrapped in a heat which
threatened to melt me, and for one moment, my
heart had stopped beating.


{CEP026}
[Takeshi]
Hey, I'm back, Tsugumi.


{CEP027}
[Takeshi]
Sorry... for taking so long...

He whispered...


{CEP028}
[Takeshi]
You know...


{CEP029}
[Takeshi]
You're as cute as ever...


{CEP030}
[Tsugumi]
Eh? Eh? Eh? S-stop it... I...


22 :

{CEP031}
[Takeshi]
No, you're too cute.


{CEP032}
[Tsugumi]
What's with you all of a sudden...


{CEP033}
[Takeshi]
You're so cute, I could just eat you up.


{CEP034}
[Tsugumi]
S-stop it... What... are you talking about...?


23 :

{CEP035}
[Takeshi]
Uh-huh, you sure are charming.


{CEP036}
[Takeshi]
"I suppose that's why they call you 
Chami... It's a good name."


{CEP037}
[Tsugumi]
...What?


24 :
I forcefully pried myself away from Takeshi's
chest.

His eyes were leveled at my shoulder.

I looked over to see what he was staring at.

Chami was busy grooming himself with jerky
movements using both of his front paws...


{CEP038}
[Tsugumi]
I can't believe it...


{CEP039}
[Tsugumi]
You're such a jerk, Takeshi!


25 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}‡LMatsunaga Sara‡L{16:1}


26 :

{16:4}

27 :

{CEP039}
[Tsugumi]
You're such a jerk, Takeshi!

Mama let out a yell and spun around...
then went back inside the boat, tail
wagging.

She moved unexpectedly, and Chami, who had
been riding on her shoulder, lost his balance
and fell to the deck.


{CEP040}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi, what's wrong?

Dad went chasing after Mom.

‡LBAM! Wham! Bang! Crash! Craaaaaash!


A series of frightful sounds ensued.

I looked over on the other side of the
window and could see Mama wildly
brandishing the head of the costume
she'd been wearing.

She'd donned one of the lemur costumes
in order to stay out of the sun.

I could see Father's back as he was
desperately trying to calm Mother down...


28 :
Hokuto and I looked at each other and started
laughing.

And Chami...?

He was calmly acting as if nothing had
happened and just continued cleaning himself.

I leaned down to put Chami in my palm and
stood back up.

Mama had already told me about the little
hamster's ordeal.

When I thought about how Chami had lived
through the same circumstances we had, it
made my heart warm.

I could feel the beating of his tiny heart in
my palm.

Thump, thump... His heartbeat was tiny, but
consistent...

It went without saying, but I thought to
myself‡L'Chami is living each moment to the
fullest.'


{CEP041}
[Sara]
"Hey, onii-chan? What do you think is going to
happen to us after this?"


29 :

{CEP042}
[Hokuto]
What do you mean...?


{CEP043}
[Sara]
With Leiblich...


30 :

{CEP044}
[Sara]
"You don't think Leiblich will come after us, 
do you...?"


{CEP045}
[Y¤u'haru']
We'll be alright, Sara... Don't worry, okay?

Someone was talking to us.

Looking around, I saw...


31 :

{CEP046}
[Sara]
Oh. Hi, Nakkyu... No, wait, uh...


{CEP047}
[Sara]
Tanaka‡LYubiseiharukana-san, right?

Doctor Tanaka nodded slightly.


32 :
Hokuto asked Doctor Tanaka...


{CEP048}
[Hokuto]
What do you mean, we'll be alright?



33 :

{CEP049}
[Y¤u'haru']
What I mean is...

Murmuring that, she took out the newspaper
that had been tucked into her pocket and
handed it to my brother.

He opened it up.

I nestled up against his shoulder and looked
at the front page headline.


34 :
'Leiblich Pharmaceuticals, responsible for
outbreak of Tief Blau virus!?'

'Compulsory investigation to begin in a day or
two.'

{16:4}

35 :
It was learned that the Tief Blau virus (TB),
which has ravaged the world since 2017,

was manufactured by the Frankfurt-based
pharmaceutical giant Leiblich Pharmaceuticals


when a whistleblower from the Japanese-German
joint-managed research facility came forward
earlier this week.

{16:4}

36 :
Spurred by these allegations, the Metropolitan
Police Department is expected to open a
criminal investigation

that will focus on Leiblich's branch offices,
as well as related research facilities.

{16:4}

37 :
Leiblich Pharmaceuticals has been conducting
research and development of TB for some time for
the purpose of manufacturing a biological
weapon.

An outbreak of the virus is rumored to have
occurred in their research facility around
May 1st, 2017.

{16:4}

38 :
Leiblich not only sought to cover up the
accident, but also continued research into TB
without the authorization of the Ministry of
Health under conditions of extreme secrecy,
according to the whistleblower.

The location of the company's research
institute has not yet been confirmed.

Numerous other doubts involving Leiblich,
including charges that it wrongfully detained
citizens for the purpose of human
experiments, have been raised and are to be
investigated.

{16:4}

39 :
In order to fully uncover the facts behind
these allegations and the reported incident, the
Metropolitan Police Department is requesting
cooperation from authorities in Germany, where
Leiblich's head office is located.

{16:4}

40 :

{CEP050}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Leiblich has a lot of influence, even 
political clout at the national level... so 
laying the groundwork for this was really 
tough, but..."

Doctor Tanaka took out an old marker and
scratched it against her cheek.


{CEP051}
[Hokuto]
"So... the whistleblower mentioned in this 
article is..."


41 :

{CEP052}
[Y¤u'haru']
That's right, it was me.


{CEP053}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Actually, I leaked this to the police and 
the press quite a long time ago."


{CEP054}
[Y¤u'haru']
"But there was a lot of behind the scenes 
maneuvering..."


{CEP055}
[Y¤u'haru']
"So I told them, 'Whatever happens, DON'T 
move before May 7th!'"


{CEP056}
[Sara]
"You mean in order to rescue Dad and that 
girl, £o¢o-chan?"


42 :

{CEP057}
[Y¤u'haru']
That's right.


{CEP058}
[Sara]
Well... Uh...


{CEP059}
[Sara]
"That means they won't come after us! And 
we're free!"


43 :

{CEP060}
[Y¤u'haru']
Yep.


{CEP061}
[Y¤u'haru']
So there's nothing to worry about, okay?

Doctor Tanaka smiled kindly.


Just then...


44 :

{CEP062}
[Y¤u'aki']
"'There's nothing to worry about'? How can 
you say that?"


{CEP063}
[Y¤u'aki']
Do you have any clue who you're talking to?


45 :

{CEP064}
[Y¤u'haru']
Y¤u...


46 :

{CEP065}
[Y¤u'aki']
"Do you have any idea how... how hard a time 
that Mayo's been through... Have you stopped 
to think about that, Mom!?"

[Y¤u'haru']
.........

[Hokuto]
.........

[Sara]
.........


47 :

{CEP066}
[Y¤u'aki']
Come here, Mom... for a second.


{CEP067}
[Y¤u'aki']
I have something to tell you.


48 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}‡LTanaka Yubiseiharukana‡L{16:1}


49 :

{16:4}

50 :

{CEP067}
[Y¤u'aki']
I have something to tell you.


51 :
Saying that, my daughter tugged firmly on
my arm and led me over to a corner of the deck.


52 :

{CEP068}
[Y¤u'haru']
What do you want to talk about?


{CEP069}
[Y¤u'aki']
You already know that, don't you?


{CEP070}
[Y¤u'aki']
"In 2025, you started working at LeMU. To 
conduct research into the third eye..."


{CEP071}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I mean, in order to save the real Kuranari
Takeshi and that girl called £o¢o..."

[Y¤u'haru']
.........


{CEP072}
[Y¤u'aki']
So why?


{CEP073}
[Y¤u'aki']
"If you were working at LeMU, you could have 
found a way to rescue Mayo, who's been locked 
up at Leiblich's facility all this time."


{CEP074}
[Y¤u'aki']
"You could have reunited Tsugumi and her kids, 
right?"


53 :

{CEP075}
[Y¤u'aki']
So why didn't...


{CEP076}
[Y¤u'haru']
Well...

It had to be done to save Kuranari and £o¢o.

We didn't dare to change history.

Because I had made a promise to Blick Winkel
in 2017...


{CEP077}
[Y¤u'aki']
"So... you aren't going to tell me anything, 
are you?"


{CEP078}
[Y¤u'aki']
"It's always like this... You always decide 
everything..."


{CEP079}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Even if you couldn't trust me enough to 
explain things before all of this happened..."


54 :

{CEP080}
[Y¤u'aki']
You didn't have to lie to me!


{CEP081}
[Y¤u'aki']
You've lied to me these eighteen years!

Yes, I had...

And there was really nothing I could say to
apologize...


55 :

{CEP082}
[Y¤u'aki']
"So I don't want you to lie to me... or hide 
anything... I want to know everything..."


{CEP083}
[Y¤u'aki']
"There are still things you haven't told me 
yet, right?"


{CEP084}
[Y¤u'aki']
Like who my real dad and mom were...


56 :

{CEP085}
[Y¤u'aki']
Tell me... Please...


57 :
I didn't hesitate.

I told her about her father, Yoichi, and
mother, Yukie...

I told her the truth. All of it.


58 :
‡LMay 6th, 2017.

Because £o¢o was sick, we had all headed to
the IBF research lab.

While Kuranari, the young Kaburaki, and Tsugumi
were searching around the research facility,
I stayed behind in the examination room.

£o¢o and the researcher were lying in the
capsule pods.

The researcher, who was fighting to stay
conscious as the virus consumed his body,
told me...


{CEP086}
[Researcher]
"...Y¤u... I never dreamed... that we would meet 
again... in a place like this..."

That was right, he was my father‡LT.Y.‡LTanaka
Yoichi.

As he was lying there in agony, he explained
to me what had happened.

.........

The year 2000‡L

My father was a researcher on the LeMMIH
development project. One day, by accident, he
discovered that Leiblich was developing the
TB virus.

TB was a potent virus with an exceedingly high
mortality rate, and Leiblich was planning
to sell it to military buyers around the world.


Father, whose sense of justice was stronger
than anyone I had ever known, appealed to
the company to stop development of the
virus immediately.

But of course, they refused... That being the
case, my father made up his mind...

He hacked into the highly protected company
database, collected evidence, and prepared to
leak the information to the press.

However...

Leiblich found out before he could make his
move and put him in a situation he could not
escape from.

They threatened my father, telling him,
Should you escape from here, your wife and
child will probably die... in an 'unfortunate
car accident'.'

And to my mother, Yukie, Leiblich said...

'Your husband is missing after a
tragic accident.'

'When making his rounds on the LeMU premises, he
slipped and fell into the ocean.'

'We are doing everything we can to search the
surrounding waters, but his remains still
have not been located.'

My mother believed them.

It was the very first summer of my life.

.........

Time passed, and it was the year 2017‡L

My father, who had been maintaining the
computer system for IBF, was caught up in the
TB outbreak.

As all of the researchers fled one by one, my
father stayed in IBF... because he was worried
about me.

My father knew I was working at LeMU.

And my father...

Right in front of my eyes...

After enduring one disaster after another and
gasping in pain...

While clawing at his throat...

He struggled until the end to say...


{C6A086}
[Researcher]
...My daughter...


{C6A087}
[Researcher]
Daughter... take care... of her...

His last words...


59 :
[Y¤u'aki']
.........


{CEP087}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Because of that accident, the Tief Blau virus broke 
out, causing terrible suffering all over the 
world..."


{CEP088}
[Y¤u'haru']
"But... Leiblich Pharmaceuticals concealed 
everything. The truth about the virus and the 
research facility was locked away."


60 :
And the press only reported that it was 'a
deadly virus of unknown origin'.

{16:4}

61 :
Even the experts had no idea where the
disease really came from.

However, the incubation period was very
short, so even though the death rate was
high, in many cases the carrier died before
infecting others.

So, while the TB virus spread rapidly for a
time, by 2019, two years after the accident,
the pace and scale of the disease's
destruction gradually waned.

{16:4}

62 :
But that didn't mean there weren't victims.


The number of people that the virus killed
was said to have reached several tens of
thousands.

And...

{16:4}

63 :
One of them was my mother, Yukie.

It was fifteen years ago that my mother caught
TB, and it robbed her of her life.

My sadness, anger, and hatred all came
together then.

I swore that I would get revenge on
Leiblich...

{16:4}

64 :
I infiltrated LeMU and simultaneously started
formulating a plan to rescue Kuranari and £o¢o,
who were trapped in the research facility.


And the person who helped me to do that was
Kaburaki Ryogo.

We had spent every moment for the last seventeen
years preparing for it.

Yes... It was the only thing that I'd lived
for up until that point.

{16:4}

65 :
To make Leiblich pay for taking my mother and
father from me and to save
my friends Kuranari and £o¢o.

And in order to do that, we needed to
discover the third eye‡LBlick Winkel.

Without his help, there was nothing we could
do...

There was no other way that we, who were
living in our dimension, could go back in
time...

.........

{16:4}

66 :
That was how the whole plan had been set in
motion.

All toward May 1st, 2034...

{16:4}

67 :
After finishing my explanation, I let out a
big sigh.

Biting on the nail of her thumb, my daughter
looked up at the sky.


{CEP089}
[Y¤u'haru']
"See, look at that face... I knew you wouldn't 
believe me."


68 :
She looked at me.


{CEP090}
[Y¤u'haru']
Then again, who would believe a story like that?


{CEP091}
[Y¤u'haru']
"But... it doesn't change the fact that it's 
the truth..."

I reached out to stroke her hair.

She stared at me blankly...


Looking just like I did seventeen years before...

Reckless, full of fire, pure, all to the point of
being dangerous and unable to control her
emotions.

Her innocent eyes... had seen none of the evil
and corruption in the world.

Looking into her eyes, I could read
everything she was thinking.

She wasn't mad. She wasn't unhappy.


Just afraid to accept the truth... She didn't
know how to handle it... and was scared and
embarrassed by that fact.

So I reached out and held her closely.

'There's no need for you to say anything'‡LI
thought that quietly to myself.


69 :

{CEP092}
[Y¤u'aki']
Mom...


{CEP093}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I... understand what you're trying to tell 
me..."

She whispered that quietly in my ear.


{CEP094}
[Y¤u'aki']
But there's something I have to know.


{CEP095}
[Y¤u'haru']
What?


{CEP096}
[Y¤u'aki']
What do I mean to you?


{CEP097}
[Y¤u'haru']
Haha.

I laughed without thinking and replied...


{CEP098}
[Y¤u'haru']
You are everything to me.


70 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}‡LTanaka Yubiseiakikana‡L{16:1}


71 :

{16:4}

72 :

{CEP098}
[Y¤u'haru']
You are everything to me.

Mom said those words to me.

I had wanted her to tell me, 'You are my
daughter', but...

For some reason, it didn't bother me.

'Shouldn't you be furious?' and 'You should
slap her across the face'...


Another voice inside my head murmured that.


However, I couldn't get angry.

I relaxed against my mother, who held me
tightly, and I could only feel dizzy from her
warmth...

All of my normal reactions, such as lashing
out like a wild animal and my sudden mood
swings...

The warmth of her hug took all of that away...


Mom...

When it came down to it, I still thought of
her as my mother.

There was an instinctive 'itch' that
transcended my basic reason... It was beyond
my ability to control...

In the end, no matter what anyone said, the
woman in front of me was my mother.

She wasn't much of a mother, but to me, she
was the only mother I had.

And that was all there was to it...

At that moment, it occurred to me‡LI only
differed from other people in the way that I
was born.

.........

I had been told since I was a little girl
that there were lots of things in the world
that were hard to believe.

In junior high and high school, all of my
friends loved to talk about all kinds of
strange things.

Psychic phenomena, supernatural powers, UFOs,
UMAs, super-ancient civilizations, urban
myths, curses, fortune-telling, miracles,
mysteries...

I thought I had dismissed all of those things
as girlish fantasies...


But something... had changed slightly.

Because my existence itself was something
hard to explain...

If I thought about the fact that I myself,
'the girl called Y¤u', was somewhat of a
mystic entity...

Then ectoplasm, cattle mutilations, Rip Van
Winkle, the Lemurian civilization...


All of those seemed like normal, everyday
things.

Even the 'third eye'...

.........


73 :
While those thoughts drifted through my
head, my mother quietly went inside of the
boat.

Left by myself in the corner of the deck, I
basked in the lingering warmth that remained
on my skin.

The boat slowly rocked back and forth as it
cut through the waves.

The smell of the ocean quietly wafted by,
carried by the sea breeze.

Soon...


74 :

{CEP099}
[Hokuto]
"Oh, hey, Y¤u... You been here all along? I've 
been looking for you."

The Kid, Hokuto, came walking over to me.


75 :

{CEP100}
[Hokuto]
"Actually, there was something that I wanted 
to ask you..."


{CEP101}
[Y¤u'aki']
Ask me?

Hokuto nodded deeply and said...


76 :

{CEP102}
[Hokuto]
"I've been thinking I want to study 
archaeology when I go to college..."


77 :

{16:0x}‡LHokuto‡L{16:1}


78 :

{16:4}

79 :

{CEP102}
[Hokuto]
"I've been thinking I want to study 
archaeology when I go to college..."

I told Y¤u what had been on my mind.


80 :

{CEP103}
[Y¤u'aki']
Eh? Why that again...?


{CEP104}
[Hokuto]
"Well, because I want to study more about the 
third eye."

Y¤u was silent.

'Huh!? What are you, stupid!? There's no such
thing as the third eye!'

I thought for sure that she would come back
with something like that, so I was caught off
guard by her reply.


{CEP105}
[Y¤u'aki']
And? What did you want to ask me about?


{CEP106}
[Hokuto]
Ah, uh, well...


{CEP107}
[Hokuto]
"I've already made up my mind that I'm going 
to study archaeology, but..."


{CEP108}
[Hokuto]
"Still... I don't really know that much about 
it..."


{CEP109}
[Hokuto]
"Like what kinds of things I should do to 
prepare or if there are any books you know 
that are good primers on the subject."


{CEP110}
[Hokuto]
"I was hoping that you could give me some 
advice..."


81 :

{CEP111}
[Y¤u'aki']
"Well, I don't know what kind of advice I can 
give."


{CEP112}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I only just started college, and I've only 
really taken my reqs, so..."


{CEP113}
[Hokuto]
'Reqs'?


82 :

{CEP114}
[Y¤u'aki']
Required classes.


{CEP115}
[Y¤u'aki']
"In order to major in archaeology, you've got 
to be a junior."


{CEP116}
[Hokuto]
Oh...


{CEP117}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I'm sorry, but I really can't tell you 
anything..."


{CEP118}
[Y¤u'aki']
Oh, but maybe there is one thing.


83 :

{CEP119}
[Y¤u'aki']
You should probably study something else.


{CEP120}
[Hokuto]
Huh? Why?


{CEP121}
[Y¤u'aki']
"Archaeology is WAY more boring than you're 
probably thinking."


{CEP122}
[Y¤u'aki']
"It's a lot different than what they show in 
the movies."


84 :

{CEP123}
[Y¤u'aki']
Besides...


{CEP124}
[Y¤u'aki']
"If you want to study about the third eye, 
you're better off attacking it from the 
direction of philosophy or psychology."


{CEP125}
[Y¤u'aki']
"In the first place, archaeology is a subject that 
studies HUMAN history."


{CEP126}
[Hokuto]
"But... it's okay! I've already made up my 
mind!"


{CEP127}
[Hokuto]
"I've been thinking I could approach the 
study of the third eye from the angle of
human history."


85 :

{CEP128}
[Y¤u'aki']
There you go, being difficult as always.


{CEP129}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I think the real reason you want to study 
it is so that you can be in the same field 
as me."


{CEP130}
[Y¤u'aki']
I mean, it's obvious that you like me...


{CEP131}
[Hokuto]
Yeah, you're probably right.


86 :
I told her point-blank how I felt.


87 :
And it seemed like my reply caught her
off guard.


{CEP132}
[Hokuto]
"Part of me feels like choosing to study 
archaeology was already half-decided by 
destiny... so I don't have a choice."


{CEP133}
[Y¤u'aki']
By destiny?


{CEP134}
[Hokuto]
Yeah.


{CEP135}
[Hokuto]
"In another space-time continuum, I'm 
destined to walk that path in the future."


{CEP136}
[Y¤u'aki']
...Huh?


{CEP137}
[Hokuto]
"I don't think you'll understand it no 
matter how much I explain it anyway."


{CEP138}
[Hokuto]
But I know what I saw.


{CEP139}
[Hokuto]
"In that future, you and I were going out, 
and..."


88 :

{CEP140}
[Y¤u'aki']
...What!?


{CEP141}
[Hokuto]
"So I'm pretty sure that in this time, you 
and I are destined to be together as well."


89 :

{CEP142}
[Y¤u'aki']
"H-h-h-hey, wait a second, Kid! You're getting 
ahead of yourself here!"


{CEP143}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I don't know much about fate, but... things 
like that are decided with both people's 
consent. AFTER that happens, you start going 
out."


{CEP144}
[Hokuto]
Yeah... Okay, I'll say it right now.


90 :

{CEP145}
[Y¤u'aki']
N-now!?


{CEP146}
[Hokuto]
Yeah...


{CEP147}
[Hokuto]
Yubiseiakikana-san...


{CEP148}
[Hokuto]
Would you go out with me?


{CEP149}
[Hokuto]
Because I'm crazy about you.

{16:0x}‡LKaburaki Ryogo‡L{16:1}


92 :

{16:4}

93 :
'Because I loved her‡L'


It was 2017... I was still fifteen.

I was stuck in LeMU in a total state of
confusion with no memory, and I had even
forgotten my name, Kaburaki Ryogo.

I was fifteen years old‡Lall I wanted at that
time was stability.

Young as I was, I was overcome with amnesia
and even doubts as to whether my existence
would fade away.

In the midst of my chaos, it was her innocent
smile that helped thaw my frozen heart.

I fell for her right away.

All I had to do was see her smile. That was all
it took for my fear to disappear, blown away
like leaves falling off a tree in autumn.

Although I was still uncertain about who I
was, her uniqueness helped me turn my eyes
away from the turmoil inside of me to the
world around me.

Perhaps it was because of my uncertainty.


I supposed that I might have been grasping for
my identity through the love that I felt for
her.

I was an empty shell at that time.

Flowing into that void was her simple pure
smile, innocent mannerisms, and
genuine sincerity.

From that point on‡Lfor six days‡Lshe was in my
thoughts constantly. I found myself looking
at her all the time.

I didn't have the courage to tell her. But it
was enough for me just to see her.

That was how fond I was of her.

I loved her.

Yagami £o¢o...

.........

And then May 6th, the fateful day, arrived.

I had come down with TB, and when the rescue
team found me, I had lost consciousness.

By the time I found out that £o¢o had been
left behind in the research facility, a few
days had already passed.

When Y¤u (Yubiseiharukana) told me what had
happened, I was shocked.

At the same time, I thought, 'I've got to
go save her!' and ran outside without waiting for
Y¤u to finish the rest of her story.


Y¤u caught up with me and started telling me
things about the third eye, the fourth
dimension, the past and future, but none of
it made sense.

'Seventeen years from now, you have to go back to
LeMU. You'll return as Kuranari Takeshi.'

'Unless we can trick Blick Winkel, wake him
up, and bring him to our world, we'll never
save £o¢o and Kuranari.'

'So please... help me?'‡LThat was what Y¤u
asked of me.

It took a few more months for me to become
fully convinced.

.........

All I wanted to do was save £o¢o.

If she'd be alright, I didn't mind the danger.

Even if I was despised, blamed, criticized,
even ridiculed, none of that mattered to me.

I... just wanted... to see... £o¢o's smile
again...

Still, there was Takeshi to consider as well.

I respected him greatly.


'He was brave enough to sacrifice his life to
save the woman that he loved.'

For a fifteen-year-old like me, Takeshi was a role
model.

I swore that I would save £o¢o and Takeshi
no matter what it took.

.........

Seventeen years later‡L

For seventeen years, Y¤u and I had spent every
minute, every second putting our plan in
motion.

Yes... I had lived for that day.


Just six days... £o¢o and I had only spent
six days together.

But in those seventeen years, not a moment went
by that I didn't think about her.

'Because I loved her‡L'


That was the only reason I had been able to
fool everyone.


{CEP150}
[£o¢o]
Heeey, Kiddo, Kiddo, Kiddo~

My heart leaped.

She was calling to me...

I couldn't turn around.

I stood there, frozen, even forgetting to
breathe.


94 :

{CEP151}
[£o¢o]
"Hey! What are you doing here all by 
yourself!?"

£o¢o rapped me on the head and peeked around
at my face.


95 :

{CEP152}
[£o¢o]
"Come on and join everyone! It's no fun by 
yourself, right?"


{CEP153}
[Kaburaki]
I...


96 :

{CEP154}
[£o¢o]
"Huh? You're not... worried about something, are 
you?"

[Kaburaki]
.........


97 :

{CEP155}
[£o¢o]
"Are you feeling bad that you lied to 
everyone?"

[Kaburaki]
.........


98 :

{CEP156}
[£o¢o]
You don't have to worry about that.


99 :

{CEP157}
[£o¢o]
"Besides, if you hadn't been able to trick 
Blick Winkel-san, Takepyon and I wouldn't be 
here right now."


{CEP158}
[£o¢o]
We owe you our lives, right?


{CEP159}
[£o¢o]
You don't have to explain a thing...


{CEP160}
[£o¢o]
"We're all grateful to you. Nobody here blames 
you."


{CEP161}
[Kaburaki]
You really think so?


{CEP162}
[£o¢o]
Of course I do.


100 :

{CEP163}
[£o¢o]
Okay? So come on~


{CEP164}
[£o¢o]
"Everybody's waiting to hear your voice, 
Kiddo~"


{CEP165}
[£o¢o]
Waiting and waiting and waiting~


{CEP166}
[£o¢o]
And after that, we're going to celebrate~

£o¢o was laughing.

The smile that I had waited seventeen years to see
was shining right in front of me.


101 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}


{16:0}‡LAkanegasaki Sora‡L{16:1}


102 :

{16:4}

103 :
The smile that I had waited seventeen years to see
was shining right in front of me.

It made me dizzy to look at it.

An electronic rhythm pulsed through my
body, the excessive voltage throwing my logic
circuits out of order.

It was a pain that I had experienced before.


{CEP167}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora?

[Sora]
.........


{CEP168}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora!

[Sora]
.........


104 :

{CEP169}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Are you listening to me?


{CEP170}
[Sora]
"...Huh...? Um, what were you talking about 
again?"


105 :

{CEP171}
[Takeshi]
This here... Pipi.


{CEP172}
[Takeshi]
"He stopped moving all of a sudden. I just 
thought maybe you could take a look at him."

Kuranari-san lifted up Pipi and stuck him out in
front of me.


{CEP173}
[Sora]
"All of a sudden, you say? Any reason you can 
think of...?"


{CEP174}
[Takeshi]
Uumm, maybe.


106 :

{CEP175}
[Takeshi]
"Maybe Tsugumi? She started thrashing around in
the cabin, and..."


{CEP176}
[Takeshi]
"I tried to pin her down, but she threw me 
off..."


{CEP177}
[Takeshi]
"And when I went down, this little guy 
happened to be there, and..."


{CEP178}
[Sora]
"I landed right on top of him. Maybe that's 
what could've caused it?"


{CEP179}
[Takeshi]
Yup. After that, he stopped moving...


{CEP180}
[Sora]
Let me take a look.

I took Pipi from Kuranari-san and started a
diagnostic on him.


{CEP181}
[Sora]
"That's strange... I don't see anything wrong 
with him."


{CEP182}
[Sora]
Maybe his battery ran out?


107 :

{CEP183}
[Takeshi]
Whew, what a relief.


{CEP184}
[Takeshi]
"If they thought I'd broken him, £o¢o, Y¤u, 
and her daughter would've been furious at me."


{CEP185}
[Sora]
Well, I would have been angry too.

Upset that he hadn't included me, I
continued...


{CEP186}
[Sora]
I'm fond of Pipi too, you know.


{CEP187}
[Sora]
"I don't even think 'fond' describes it. You 
might say Pipi and I are connected on a 
deeper level."


{CEP188}
[Sora]
Seventeen years ago...


{CEP189}
[Sora]
"If Pipi hadn't picked up my terabyte disc, I 
wouldn't be here right now."


{CEP190}
[Sora]
"And after Pipi got to the surface, 
Tanaka-san... Yubiseiharukana-san, that is..."


{CEP191}
[Sora]
"Took the data off the disc and copied it to 
the body you see now..."


{CEP192}
[Sora]
"That is the reason I was able to maintain the 
records of what happened to all of you seventeen 
years ago."


{CEP193}
[Sora]
"After that, Tanaka-san took in Pipi... and from
that time on, he's been a member of the Tanaka 
family."


{CEP194}
[Sora]
"In other words, Pipi is an irreplaceable 
part of all of our lives."


{CEP195}
[Sora]
I thought I'd already told you this.


108 :

{CEP196}
[Takeshi]
"Uh, yeah, that's right, now that you mention 
it..."


{CEP197}
[Takeshi]
"But come on, you don't have to get so 
serious about it."


109 :

{CEP198}
[Takeshi]
"Besides, Pipi isn't broken... so what's the 
big deal?"

Kuranari-san laughed pleasantly.

(Ah, I... I can't fight it.)

His smile always disarmed me.

It was as bright as the sun and powerfully
magnetic. He could charm me effortlessly.

(It isn't fair... That smile should be
outlawed, Kuranari-san.)


110 :

{CEP199}
[Takeshi]
By the way, Sora? Can I ask you something?


{CEP200}
[Sora]
Wh-what is it?

I looked away and tried desperately to regain
control of my wildly racing mind so that he
would not see through to my true feelings.


111 :

{CEP201}
[Takeshi]
"I hope you don't think it's rude of me to 
ask this, but..."


{CEP202}
[Takeshi]
Um... Er... Uh...


{CEP203}
[Takeshi]
It's about your body.


{CEP204}
[Sora]
My body?


112 :

{CEP205}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


{CEP206}
[Takeshi]
"As far as I can tell, you look totally 
human, your skin..."


{CEP207}
[Takeshi]
"The way you move, your appearance, 
everything is so natural..."


{CEP208}
[Sora]
Hahaha, that isn't rude at all.


{CEP209}
[Sora]
"Actually, that's a compliment, isn't it? 
Thank you."


{CEP210}
[Sora]
And... was that your question?


{CEP211}
[Takeshi]
"Uh, no... I mean... I was wondering how your 
body is put together, that's all."


{CEP212}
[Sora]
Is it strange to you?


{CEP213}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, a bit.


{CEP214}
[Takeshi]
At the same time... I'm happy.


113 :

{CEP215}
[Takeshi]
I mean... I can actually touch you now.

As he said that, Kuranari-san put his hand on my
cheek.

It burned... A lump, hot and boiling, ran from
my stomach to my brain.

My generator was burning too much energy,
frying my processor... My logic
circuits... shut down.


{CEP216}
[Sora]
K-K-K-Kuranari-san...

Holding Pipi firmly to my chest, I grabbed
onto Kuranari-san's palm with my free hand.


(Ah... Ah... We're actually touching each
other...)

(We can touch each other... Really touch each
other...)

I had waited those seventeen years for just that
moment.


114 :

{CEP217}
[Takeshi]
"Wh-what's wrong, Sora? Have you been drinking 
or something? Your face is all red."


{CEP218}
[Sora]
Professor Kuranari...


{CEP219}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what is it, Akanegasaki-kun...?


{CEP220}
[Sora]
"There are so many strange things in this 
world, don't you think?"


{CEP221}
[Takeshi]
?


{CEP222}
[Sora]
"You asked about my body, didn't you, 
Professor?"


{CEP223}
[Sora]
"You wondered how I came to have this body, 
didn't you?"


{CEP224}
[Takeshi]
Y-yeah...


{CEP225}
[Sora]
There is only one answer.


{CEP226}
[Sora]
It was a miracle.


115 :

{CEP227}
[Takeshi]
Miracle?


{CEP228}
[Sora]
Yes‡La miracle from the goddess Aphrodite.

Kuranari-san looked straight into my eyes and
blinked.

He opened his eyes wide with a start and
said...


116 :

{CEP229}
[Takeshi]
Pygmalion...

I slowly, quietly nodded.

Just then‡L


117 :

{CEP230}
[£o¢o]
Hellooooo!

In came the girl with boundless energy, £o¢o-chan.

I quickly let go of Kuranari-san's hand.


118 :

{CEP231}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey, have any of you seen Pipi?


119 :

{CEP232}
[£o¢o]
Wait a sec, you're holding him, Sora-san!


{CEP233}
[Sora]
"Yes... But it looks like Pipi ran out of 
batteries."

Saying that, I handed Pipi over to £o¢o-chan.


120 :

{CEP234}
[£o¢o]
Out of batteries? That can't be!


{CEP235}
[£o¢o]
I just finished charging him a minute ago.

£o¢o-chan held Pipi between both her hands
and started shaking him left to right.

He wasn't rechargeable kinetically, so that
shouldn't have done anything for him, but...


{CEP236}
[Sora]
...Ah!


121 :
I exclaimed that without thinking as I
realized something.

£o¢o-chan and Kuranari-san both turned to
stare at me.

{CEP237}
[Sora]
I figured it out. The reason, I mean.


122 :

{CEP238}
[Takeshi]
The reason?


{CEP239}
[Sora]
His switch.


{CEP240}
[Sora]
I think you just need to turn on his switch.


123 :
£o¢o-chan lifted Pipi up above her.

There was a button in his navel.


{CEP241}
[Sora]
Are you ready? Here I go.

I stuck out my finger and zeroed in on his
belly button.

And...


{CEP242}
[Sora]
Click!

I firmly pushed the button.

Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirr...

His motor started to run, and I could hear
the faint sound of something oscillating.

Pipi's eyes came to life.


{PIPI_14}
[Pipi]
*Bow*! *Bow-wow*! *Wooof*!


124 :

{CEP243}
[£o¢o]
Haha! Sora-san, thank you!


{CEP244}
[Sora]
"Don't mention it. All I did was push a 
button."

Just then...


125 :

{CEP245}
[Takeshi]
Hahaha! Ahahahahaha!

Kuranari-san broke out in laughter.


{CEP246}
[Takeshi]
Hey... Sora, you remembered?


{CEP247}
[Sora]
Yes.

I smiled from the bottom of my heart and
nodded.

The world was full of strange and wonderful
things.

Wasn't it?

The discussion about Pygmalion... and saying
'click'...

Neither of those should have been on my
terabyte disc...

.........


126 :

{PIPI_09}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!

Pipi leaped from £o¢o-chan's arms.


{PIPI_13}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Bow-wow*!

Wagging his tail fitfully, he raced
across the deck.


127 :

{CEP248}
[£o¢o]
Hey! Wait, waaaaiiit! Pipiii!

Making a racket, £o¢o-chan chased after him.


The deck was covered in gentle sunlight and
overflowing with cheerful laughter.


128 :
Looking up, there was the sky...

The blue sky that continued without end,
stretching out in all directions.


{PIPI_11}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*!


{CEP249}
[£o¢o]
"Piiipiii! Hey you, wait a second, you 
little...!"


129 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}‡LYagami £o¢o‡L{16:1}


130 :

{16:4}

131 :

{PIPI_11}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*!


{CEP249}
[£o¢o]
"Piiipiii! Hey you, wait a second, you 
little...!"

I was chasing after Pipi.


I didn't know why, but that was what I was doing.

It was probably just something fun to do.


Pipi ran across the surface of the deck like
he was flying.

Suddenly...

Pipi stopped.


132 :

{PIPI_16}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow-wow*! *Woof*! *Bow-wow-wow*!

Just when I thought he wasn't running
anymore, he looked up to the sky and started
barking at something.


{CEP250}
[£o¢o]
Huh? Is there a bird or something?

I lifted him up.

Still, he wouldn't stop barking, so I followed
his gaze and looked up into the sky.

And there was...


133 :

{CEP251}
[£o¢o]
Oh! It's you, onii-chan!

Right in front of my eyes, I saw the floating
outline of my onii-chan, who I loved dearly.

Well, it wasn't something I SAW... Rather,
I'm seeing it right now.

Right now, at this moment, £o¢o-chan is looking at
you.

I cry out suddenly with an elated
expression.


134 :

{CEP252}
[£o¢o]
Heeey! Everyone! Come over here!


{CEP253}
[£o¢o]
Come here! Quickly! Quuuuuuickly!


135 :
The first people to arrive are Hokutan and
Tsugumin.


{CEP254}
[Hokuto]
What's wrong?


{CEP255}
[Tsugumi]
Did something happen?


{CEP256}
[£o¢o]
Look there! See, over there!

I point at you.

I want to tell everyone that you've
arrived.

Tsugumin takes off her hat and squints her
eyes against the sunlight.

Hokutan is...


{CEP257}
[Hokuto]
Hey! It's true! You've come back!?

A smile covers his whole face, and he jumps
around as if he's going to start dancing.


136 :
Next, Takepyon shows up.


{CEP258}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What's going on?

Mayo jumps up...


{CEP259}
[Sara]
Aaaii!

Up on Takepyon's back...

And soon, everyone shows up one by one.


137 :
Sora-san... Nakkyu's daughter...


{CEP260}
[Sora]
Wh-what's going on, Tanaka-san?


{CEP261}
[Y¤u'aki']
Just come on! Hurry!


138 :
And Nakkyu... Kiddo...


{CEP262}
[Y¤u'haru']
It's him...?


{CEP263}
[Kaburaki]
Yeah...

The boat is suddenly crowded with excitement.


{CEP264}
[£o¢o]
Hey! Onii-chaaaaan! Onii-chaaaaan!

I wave my arms wildly.

Hoping... Praying...


{CEP265}
'Please let my thoughts reach my onii-chan...'


{CEP266}
'And please, let me meet with him again
someday...'

Now‡L

I, £o¢o, am looking at my onii-chan.


140 :
Now‡L

I am looking at the world where £o¢o exists.

Looking down on it with both of my eyes... I
am sure of it...

If the moon is only there because you
believe that it will be there when you look
for it...

Then it is possible that I am here and they
are here only because we believe that
we are.

Right now, the world exists here...

I am here looking at the world...

I am here looking at myself, looking at the
world...

How far do I go?

I don't know the answer...

But there are some things I am sure of.
