1 :
A soft warmth surrounded me.

Light.

I felt that I had overcome an immense distance.


The end of the darkness.

A soft white light surrounded me.

There was nothing else for me to look at.

There was nothing below me.

Nothing there to support me.

But for some reason, I was at peace.

I was floating.

Floating steadfastly.

I was swaying freely in the center...


2 :
In the center of gently drifting water.

I could hear something faintly.

The first sound I had heard in my life‡L

Yes, it was the sound of a heart beating.

I remembered.

I was surrounded by the gentle sound of a
beating heart.

There was no greater feeling of peace than
what I felt then.

How long would I be able to stay there?

I didn't know.

I knew that I would have to leave the place
at some point.

I would have to let go of that fragile bond
soon.

But I wasn't sad.

If that time must come...

Darkness cleared again, and out of it would
come...

A new world, where I would resolve to be
reborn.

.........

......


3 :

{T7T000}
[Tsugumi]
Good morning...

[Takeshi]
.........


4 :
I was lying down in bed.

Right next to me, Tsugumi was staring at me.

She was squatting next to the bed, her eyes
level with mine...

We stared at each other eye-to-eye.


5 :
[Takeshi]
What time is it?

That was the first thing I could think to say.


{T7T001}
[Tsugumi]
Well...

Tsugumi took the PDA out of my pocket.


{T7T002}
[Tsugumi]
The batteries are dead.

She pressed the buttons, but nothing appeared
on the screen.

[Takeshi]
Oh...


{T7T003}
[Tsugumi]
"You want me to go check the clock on the 
terminal?"

[Takeshi]
Nah, that's okay. Just stay here with me.


{T7T004}
[Tsugumi]
Okay...

There were tears in Tsugumi's eyes.


{T7T005}
[Tsugumi]
How are you feeling?

[Takeshi]
That's a dumb question.


{T7T006}
[Tsugumi]
Just tell me. How are you feeling?

Tsugumi held my hand softly.

The feel of her soft skin seemed like it
would pull me in.

[Takeshi]
"I don't feel so good. My body feels tired all 
over..."

[Takeshi]
But it could be worse, I guess.


{T7T007}
[Tsugumi]
Okay...

I tried opening and closing the hand that was
free in front of my face.

My movements were still sluggish.


{T7T008}
[Tsugumi]
Your cut doesn't hurt?

[Takeshi]
Cut...?


{T7T009}
[Tsugumi]
"You fell over, and... I tried to stop you from 
falling, but..."


{T7T010}
[Tsugumi]
"I didn't get there in time. You split your 
forehead, Takeshi."

Tsugumi opened her glossy lips slightly and
murmured.

I could see the tip of her red tongue.

[Takeshi]
Forehead...? Split?


{T7T011}
[Tsugumi]
Hey...


{T7T012}
[Tsugumi]
You don't remember?

I slowly looked around the room.

The ceiling...

Sheets...

The empty syringes on the floor...

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay. I remember.

[Takeshi]
I remember, I...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

I touched my forehead lightly.

That gash must have been split wide open.

There were stitches there.

[Takeshi]
No big deal.

[Takeshi]
Something like this ought to heal right up.


{T7T013}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{T7T014}
[Tsugumi]
...I'm so sorry.

[Takeshi]
Why are you apologizing?

[Takeshi]
It isn't your fault, right?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
It isn't anyone's fault.

[Takeshi]
So don't worry about it.

I patted Tsugumi on the head.

I was alive.

Even though I was banged up pretty good, I
was alive.

Besides, it wasn't a big deal.


6 :
I looked around the room once more.

There was nobody else there.

Just the two of us...

...And the silence.

It was almost too quiet to believe.

[Takeshi]
Where's the bus?


{T7T015}
[Tsugumi]
Doesn't look like it's coming.

[Takeshi]
How about a taxi?


{T7T016}
[Tsugumi]
I've already sent for it...

[Takeshi]
Communications?


{T7T017}
[Tsugumi]
Since that one, we haven't had any...

I could see the monitor.

It reported that the remote control guidance
was working normally.

It would take about one hour for it to reach
our pool...

But it seemed that the submarine was making
its way without any glitches.

[Takeshi]
Oh...

[Takeshi]
"I guess that leaves us some time to relax 
until the taxi gets here."

[Takeshi]
"Won't do us a bit of good getting worked 
up about it."


{T7T018}
[Tsugumi]
...Yeah.

Even if I had wanted to...

My body wasn't doing what I wanted it to.

It felt like I was running low on batteries...

I was exhausted.

I couldn't think straight.

I had gone beyond the limits of my strength
and spirit.


7 :
[Takeshi]
...Huh?

I noticed something and brought my face
closer to Tsugumi.


{T7T019}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what? Takeshi...

[Takeshi]
Takeshi...

[Takeshi]
I...

I almost pressed myself against her and
brought myself close to her face.


{T7T020}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-wh-wh-what...?


8 :
Her cheeks, which had been puffed up from
crying, started to turn slightly red.

[Takeshi]
I'm hungry...

I murmured, pulling my face up close.

[Takeshi]
I feel like I could eat just about anything.


{T7T021}
[Tsugumi]
R-really...

[Takeshi]
And guess what... Tsugumi.


{T7T022}
[Tsugumi]
Huh... What?

Tsugumi's face became redder and redder.

[Takeshi]
"There's just the most amazing smell coming 
from you."


{T7T023}
[Tsugumi]
...Huh?

Her eyebrows arched, as if she was annoyed...


[Takeshi]
Hey...

[Takeshi]
You're not hiding anything, are you?

[Takeshi]
Food...

I reached out for her chest.


{T7T024}
[Tsugumi]
S-s-stop it!

She quickly covered herself with her arms.


{T7T025}
[Tsugumi]
You aren't going to eat Chami, are you?


{T7T026}
[Tsugumi]
You can't! I won't let you!

[Takeshi]
As if I would, stupid...


9 :

{T7T027}
[Tsugumi]
Don't call me stupid, stupid...

Her expression returned to normal.

She undid a few of her buttons and let Chami
out from her shirt.


{T7T028}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm sorry for keeping you in there the whole 
time, Chami."


{T7T029}
[Tsugumi]
It's okay, you can go play now...

Chami sniffed the air as he rode in the palm
of Tsugumi's hand. He suddenly jumped to the
floor and ran into the corner of the room.

[Takeshi]
.........

I watched the whole time.


10 :

{T7T030}
[Tsugumi]
Ah... Takeshi...

Tsugumi spoke to me as she redid her buttons.


{T7T031}
[Tsugumi]
You were watching, weren't you?

[Takeshi]
What?


{T7T032}
[Tsugumi]
What do you mean 'what?'... When I was...


{T7T033}
[Tsugumi]
Did you want to see more?

[Takeshi]
More what?


{T7T034}
[Tsugumi]
...Forget it, you... jerk.


11 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


12 :
Ga-ga-ga-gong...

A low vibrating sound shot across the room.

The bed shook slightly...


13 :

{T7T035}
[Tsugumi]
It's okay...

She looked up for a second, then quickly
returned her gaze.


{T7T036}
[Tsugumi]
Don't worry, alright?


{T7T037}
[Tsugumi]
We're okay for now... I think.


{T7T038}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, we'll be fine, I know it.


{T7T039}
[Tsugumi]
I don't have any proof, but...

[Takeshi]
.........


{T7T040}
[Tsugumi]
"Haha, I'm even starting to talk like you 
now."


{T7T041}
[Tsugumi]
There must be something wrong with me...

[Takeshi]
.........


14 :
[Takeshi]
Aaah!

I sat up quickly.

And I grabbed hard onto Tsugumi's hand.


15 :

{T7T042}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what is it!?

[Takeshi]
I know, Tsugumi!


{T7T043}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what?

[Takeshi]
This is incredible!


{T7T044}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what are you talking about...?

Flustered, Tsugumi's cheeks changed color in
her confusion.

[Takeshi]
I've made a major discovery!

I brought her hand close to me.

Tsugumi's face was right next to mine.

[Takeshi]
Alright, listen up!


{T7T045}
[Tsugumi]
O-okay...

[Takeshi]
"I know where that great smell is coming 
from..."

[Takeshi]
It is...


16 :
[Takeshi]
You!


17 :

{T7T046}
[Tsugumi]
...Huh?


{T7T047}
[Tsugumi]
Huh? What!?

[Takeshi]
You're what smells so great...

[Takeshi]
Geez, you smell good...

[Takeshi]
What a sweet smell...

[Takeshi]
Perfect. Let me have just one bite...


18 :

{T7T048}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what are you doing...?


{T7T049}
[Tsugumi]
S-stop it... Let go of me. Let me go...


{T7T050}
[Tsugumi]
OW...


{T7T051}
[Tsugumi]
You idiot! Cut it out!


19 :
SMACK!

[Takeshi]
Owwww!

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Hey, did you really have to smack me?


{T7T052}
[Tsugumi]
Well...

[Takeshi]
Hey, I'm an injured man here.


{T7T053}
[Tsugumi]
Well, act like one... and lie there quietly...

[Takeshi]
.........


{T7T054}
[Tsugumi]
Jerk.


20 :

{T7T055}
[Tsugumi]
"What were you thinking, biting on my finger 
like that...?"

My teeth had left an imprint on her finger.

[Takeshi]
Thank you...

[Takeshi]
I'm still hungry, but I feel a lot better.

I couldn't keep sitting up, so I lay down in
bed again.


{T7T056}
[Tsugumi]
I can't believe you did that...

The tears that had dried up just a bit ago
were in Tsugumi's eyes again.

[Takeshi]
Hahaha...

I laughed at the situation.

There wasn't much strength left in me, but I
laughed anyway.

[Takeshi]
I am a man of insatiable desires.

[Takeshi]
When I get hungry, I stuff my face...

[Takeshi]
When I get sleepy, I sleep like a bear...

[Takeshi]
"And give me a chance, and I'll be thinking 
about hanky panky..."

[Takeshi]
It's all I think about.

[Takeshi]
I'm beyond salvation, right?


{T7T057}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...


{T7T058}
[Tsugumi]
So stupid...

She tried to smile back at me.

Her voice dried up, and tears began to fall.

[Takeshi]
Ahh, I'm such an idiot.

[Takeshi]
Come on, laugh at a fool like me, will you?


{T7T059}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... you are an idiot...

Tsugumi laughed.


{T7T060}
[Tsugumi]
You are the world's biggest idiot...


{T7T061}
[Tsugumi]
I can't believe how stupid you are...


{T7T062}
[Tsugumi]
And it never stops...


21 :

{T7T063}
[Tsugumi]
How did you ever get to be so dumb...

She was smiling...

But her tears wouldn't stop falling.


22 :
[Takeshi]
No reason, I guess.

[Takeshi]
I'm just trying to live all out.

[Takeshi]
Because I don't want to die.


{T7T064}
[Tsugumi]
...Really?


{T7T065}
[Tsugumi]
That's it...?

The tears continued to fall.

[Takeshi]
I...

[Takeshi]
"I think there were some things that I was 
taking too lightly."

[Takeshi]
"There are people who go on living even when 
they want to die."

[Takeshi]
"And people that die who want to keep on 
living."

[Takeshi]
I had no idea that was how things were.

[Takeshi]
"I guess I was pretty naïve about the way the 
world works..."

[Takeshi]
Until coming to LeMU, that is.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
But then I met you...

[Takeshi]
"And the way that I thought about things 
changed."

[Takeshi]
"The world isn't always filled with good 
things."


{T7T066}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...

She nodded.

I calmly wiped away her tears.

[Takeshi]
But...

[Takeshi]
"I don't want you to think that living is 
something to be embarrassed about or 
something that you should hate."

[Takeshi]
"I think that as long as you're alive, it's okay 
to live."

[Takeshi]
"I think there are good things waiting for 
you."

[Takeshi]
"Wait... Not just that, that being alive is a 
good thing in itself."

[Takeshi]
"In that way, my thinking still hasn't 
changed."


{T7T067}
[Tsugumi]
...Yeah...

She nodded.

We held each other's hands.


23 :
[Takeshi]
I don't know how to say it, but...

I looked up toward the heavens I couldn't
see.

I didn't know if there was 'something above'.

Didn't know if it really mattered.

Maybe all I had to do was accept what was there.


[Takeshi]
The reason we keep living, in other words...

[Takeshi]
What does it mean to die?

[Takeshi]
Does everything really end when we die?

[Takeshi]
Until you can stare...

[Takeshi]
"...Really STARE reality in the face, I think 
you should wait."

[Takeshi]
Put it on hold.

[Takeshi]
It isn't time for me to die yet.

[Takeshi]
"I just can't die yet. You can't either, and 
neither can any of the rest of us."

[Takeshi]
Until that time comes...

[Takeshi]
All of us should live.

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T7T068}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...

She...

Nodded as if in deep understanding.


24 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi...


{T7T069}
[Tsugumi]
Whaaat?

I looked deeply into her eyes.

I was trying to see if there was light inside
there.

I wanted to get as close as I could and see.

[Takeshi]
Hey... you're bleeding from your finger.


{T7T070}
[Tsugumi]
Well, you... bit me earlier, right?

[Takeshi]
Is that so...?


{T7T071}
[Tsugumi]
Yes, that is SO.

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry.

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi's face was close enough that we
were almost touching noses.

Closer...

Even closer still.

[Takeshi]
Ah...!


{T7T072}
[Tsugumi]
Now, what is it?

[Takeshi]
You've got blood on your lips.


{T7T073}
[Tsugumi]
Really?

[Takeshi]
That's not my fault.


{T7T074}
[Tsugumi]
...Are you being serious? Blood...

[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{T7T075}
[Tsugumi]
You're lying...?

[Takeshi]
Um...


{T7T076}
[Tsugumi]
Um... maybe you're right.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T7T077}
[Tsugumi]
"It was probably from when the building shook 
earlier."

[Takeshi]
Looks painful.


{T7T078}
[Tsugumi]
Well... if it hurts, it's your fault, Takeshi.

[Takeshi]
You think so...?


{T7T079}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
...Maybe you're right.


{T7T080}
[Tsugumi]
How are you going to make up for it?


25 :
She pressed her lips tightly on mine.

I could smell her scent.

I could taste her blood.

Taste her tears.

She bit down on my lower lip.

And my blood started to flow.

We were pressed together as tightly as we
could be...

Embracing one another with everything we had.

Our bodies came together, became one.

I felt her breath.

I felt her pulse.

I felt the warmth of her body.

A fragrant smell wafted from her neck.

A musky smell...

It made me slightly dizzy...

It was sweet...

Such a sweet smell...


26 :
.........

......


{T7T081}
[Tsugumi]
Hmm...


{T7T082}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


{T7T083}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, get up.


{T7T084}
[Tsugumi]
The taxi's here.


27 :
[Takeshi]
O-Okay...

I jumped out of the bed and stood up.

I stretched my arms and loosened my shoulders.

I felt pretty good.

I took a deep breath as I fixed my clothes,
rumpled during sleep.

My mind was firing and my head felt clear.


28 :

{T7T085}
[Tsugumi]
Chami. Chami... come here.


{T7T086}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, we've got to get going now.

Tsugumi scooped up Chami, who'd been running
around on the floor, and held him to her chest.


29 :

{T7T087}
[Tsugumi]
Huh...?

Bending over, Tsugumi let out a cry of alarm.

[Takeshi]
What's wrong, Tsugumi?


{T7T088}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... Under the bed.

[Takeshi]
Under the bed? Mine?


30 :
She nodded.

I looked under the bed I had been sleeping on.

Something was lying there...

I reached out and pulled whatever it was
closer to me.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


31 :

{T7T089}
[Tsugumi]
Pipi...

It was Pipi...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, Pipi, what's going on? What are you doing 
here?"

[Pipi]
.........

Pipi didn't respond.

All of the color had vanished from his eyes.

He didn't move at all.

Pipi was frozen... as if he was dead.

There was something stuck fast in his mouth.

I took it out gently.


32 :
It was a disc... a terabyte disc made of
polycarbonate.

I put the disc Pipi had been carrying in my
pocket.


33 :
BOOOooom!

With a roaring sound, the whole room suddenly
shook violently, and my body vibrated.


34 :

{T7T090A}
[Announcement]
"<Fünf Minuten 

{T7T090B}
vor der Implosion.>"

35 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, WHAT did that announcement just say!?

Holding Pipi under my arm, I looked up at the
ceiling.

Tsugumi quickly got up.


36 :

{T7T091}
[Tsugumi]
"We've got five minutes... until this place 
implodes."

[Takeshi]
FIVE MINUTES!?

[Takeshi]
Give me a break!

[Takeshi]
"Why do they gotta tell us when there's only 
FIVE minutes left!?"

[Takeshi]
"Give us some more warning... for cryin' out 
loud!"

I started mumbling complaints to myself.

Maybe it was mostly for show...


37 :

{T7T092}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...

Tsugumi let out a big sigh.


38 :

{T7T093}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, we've only got five minutes.

Tsugumi shrugged her shoulders exaggeratedly
and stared at me.


39 :
But for some reason... she seemed to be smiling.


{T7T094}
[Tsugumi]
"You've just got to accept reality. You could 
learn something from me, you know?"

[Takeshi]
Hahaha, listen to yourself, Tsugumi.

[Takeshi]
"Telling jokes at a time like this is more MY 
style, don't you think?"


40 :

{T7T095}
[Tsugumi]
Haha. Well, I guess you're right...


{T7T096}
[Tsugumi]
"But we should be 'fine' if we've got five 
minutes, right?"

A smile floated to her lips, and Tsugumi held
out a hand to me.

[Takeshi]
Of course.

I took her hand firmly.


41 :

{T7T097A}
[Announcement]
"<Vier Minuten 

{T7T097B}
vor der Implosion.>"

42 :
The shaking and rumbling of IBF continued.

I could hear the sound of the water rushing
in and striking against the watertight
hatches somewhere.

Ominous metallic sounds rang out from above,
and I wouldn't have been surprised if the
ceiling had suddenly ruptured.

But still, we ran without stopping.

We were running to get out of there.

I held onto Tsugumi's hand the whole time...

Her body moved fluidly as she ran.

We ran in sync with one another...

We passed through a door that stood wide open
at the end of the passage.


43 :
And on top of the pool, which looked like it
was threatening to overflow at any moment‡L


44 :
Our minisub was waiting for us.

[Takeshi]
Yes! At least something's going right...

[Takeshi]
The taxi's even waiting for us!


45 :

{T7T098}
[Tsugumi]
Well, of course.

Tsugumi looked at me with a smug face and
said...


{T7T099}
[Tsugumi]
It's a TAXI...


{T7T100}
[Tsugumi]
"They aren't going to just leave us 
high-tipping customers here."

[Takeshi]
Oh yeah, you're right... Oh NO!


46 :

{T7T101}
[Tsugumi]
What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
I forgot my wallet!


47 :

{T7T102}
[Tsugumi]
You idiot...


{T7T103}
[Tsugumi]
Well, we'll put it on your tab.

[Takeshi]
Oh, okay...

[Takeshi]
Yeah, in Leiblich's name.


48 :

{T7T104}
[Tsugumi]
Well, of course.


49 :

{T7T105A}
[Announcement]
"<Drei Minuten 

{T7T105B}
vor der Implosion.>"


50 :
Three minutes until implosion.

We scrambled to the sub and jumped down the
hatch.


51 :
The controls were simple.

We closed the hatch on the top by pressing a
button.

The submarine slipped out from the pool and
into the middle of the ocean.

The ocean currents quickly pushed us out to
sea.

Away from the sinking LeMU...

Yes...

LeMU was...

Paradise was...

Our home for seven days was...


52 :
Warping and folding on itself, like some
kind of a crumpled old newspaper.

It scattered as it collapsed, like a child's
wooden blocks that hadn't been stacked
properly...

Letting out its final breath of bubbles...

It disappeared to the bottom of the deep blue
sea.


53 :
We were moving up.

The small, fragile egg we were in floated
quietly toward the surface.


54 :

{T7T106}
[Tsugumi]
What... do we do from here?

Tsugumi asked in a quiet voice.

[Takeshi]
There's so much that I want to do.

I answered as I placed the motionless Pipi on
the seat next to me.

[Takeshi]
But first...

[Takeshi]
I'm thinking more about where to start.


{T7T107}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm...

[Takeshi]
"What about you, Tsugumi? What do you want to 
do?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
What, you didn't like the question?


{T7T108}
[Tsugumi]
No, it's not that.

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T7T109}
[Tsugumi]
Can I have a minute to think about it?

[Takeshi]
Sure.


55 :
Wham...

[Takeshi]
...?


56 :

{T7T110}
[Tsugumi]
What was that sound?

[Takeshi]
I... dunno.


57 :
Beep, beep...

The operating console made a funny sound.


{T7T111}
[Tsugumi]
What's that noise...?

[Takeshi]
No clue...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, something just came up on that screen 
over there."

The monitor behind Tsugumi started blinking.


{T7T112}
[Tsugumi]
What does it say...?

[Takeshi]
"You're closer than I am, so why don't you turn 
around and look at it yourself?"


{T7T113}
[Tsugumi]
N-no...


{T7T114}
[Tsugumi]
I don't want to see it...


{T7T115}
[Tsugumi]
I've got... a really bad feeling about this.

[Takeshi]
Don't be so selfish.

Not left with any other choice, I peeked at
the monitor.

[Takeshi]
Ah... Which one, which one...

[Takeshi]
Uumm...

[Takeshi]
'Low battery'...

[Takeshi]
...That's what it says.

[Tsugumi]
.........


58 :
The lights in the sub suddenly went out.

The monitor went dark.

All of the power went out.

The electrical equipment went silent.

The only thing still working was the analog
pressure gauge.

Depth‡L63 meters.

Internal pressure‡L12.5 atmospheres.

The submarine was set to saturation diving
specifications.

The pressure on the inside was higher than the
pressure on the outside.


{T7T116}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi...

[Takeshi]
It's okay. We're going to be fine.

[Takeshi]
Stop looking like you're going to cry.

Depth‡L64 meters.

We had lost our upward momentum...

The submarine began sinking slowly, very
slowly.

Residual air pressure: 0.

Ballast tank: Unable to drain.

[Takeshi]
Wonderful, we hitched a ride on a junker...

[Takeshi]
"You know, this cab always seems to stall on 
these country roads..."

[Takeshi]
I'm terribly sorry, esteemed passenger...

[Tsugumi]
.........

Depth‡L65 meters.

I looked at the aft hatch.

It had a two-ply hatch...

The inner side was made of reinforced glass
and FRP, while the outer side had a door made
from high-strength steel.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, you think if we let some of the high-pressure
gas out of the hatch, we'd start 
rising again?"


{T7T117}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{T7T118}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't think we'll go straight up, and our 
momentum would be limited."


{T7T119}
[Tsugumi]
"Not to mention the fact that if we do that, 
we'll start flooding..."


{T7T120}
[Tsugumi]
"Because we don't have any spare compressed 
air."


{T7T121}
[Tsugumi]
"And we don't have enough buoyancy in the main 
fuselage."

[Takeshi]
Buoyancy...


{T7T122}
[Tsugumi]
We've got to get rid of ballast...

[Takeshi]
Ballast...

Depth‡L66 meters.


{T7T123}
[Tsugumi]
"The valve used to release ballast is usually 
electronically controlled."


{T7T124}
[Tsugumi]
But now, we're...

[Takeshi]
Alright, let's just stay calm.

[Takeshi]
"Judging by how fast we're sinking... we only 
need to be a little bit lighter, right?"

[Takeshi]
"If we can get rid of a few dozen kilograms, 
we should be fine."

[Takeshi]
"Why not try pulling out a few of those 
machines over there? That should make us 
lighter."


{T7T125}
[Tsugumi]
You think it's going to be easy?

[Takeshi]
"Well... they seem to be welded on fairly well. 
Probably not easy to do bare-handed."

[Takeshi]
And unfortunately, we don't have any tools...


{T7T126}
[Tsugumi]
So that's it, huh...

Tsugumi bit her lip and looked down.

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
We're screwed...

Depth‡L67 meters.

Sinking...

We were sinking...


59 :

{T7T127}
[Tsugumi]
Looks like we celebrated too soon...


{T7T128}
[Tsugumi]
Doesn't it...


{T7T129}
[Tsugumi]
Hahaha...

Her shoulders shook from disappointment...
and she laughed without conviction.


{T7T130}
[Tsugumi]
So stupid...


{T7T131}
[Tsugumi]
I'm so stupid...

[Takeshi]
.........


60 :

{T7T132}
[Tsugumi]
Ah!?

She audibly sucked in her breath.


{T7T133}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what are you doing, Takeshi!?

[Takeshi]
What... you can't tell by looking?

[Takeshi]
I'm opening the hatch.


{T7T134}
[Tsugumi]
"That's why I'm asking you! What are you 
doing!?"

[Takeshi]
Do you even need to ask?


61 :
Depth‡L68 meters.


{T7T135}
[Tsugumi]
Stop it!


{T7T136}
[Tsugumi]
What are you planning to do!?

Tsugumi grabbed onto my arm.

[Takeshi]
Don't try to stop me...


62 :
I threw off Tsugumi's arm and raised the glass
hatch.

It was just large enough for one person to go
through.

[Takeshi]
Please don't touch me...

[Takeshi]
Don't touch me.


{T7T137}
[Tsugumi]
No! I won't let you go!


63 :
Tsugumi grabbed onto my arm firmly. The hatch
was closing.


{T7T138}
[Tsugumi]
I don't care if I die... I'm not letting go.

[Takeshi]
.........

Depth‡L69 meters.

Slowly, slowly, but steadily...

We wouldn't stop sinking.

[Takeshi]
Hmmm...

[Takeshi]
You know, you really are selfish.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

I thought for a bit...

And slowly opened my mouth.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Do you know what the Archimedes principle is?


{T7T139}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

For a moment, Tsugumi's grip relaxed.


64 :
In that brief instant, I tore myself
forcefully away from her grasp.


65 :
I quickly opened the glass hatch and slipped
to the back of the airlock.

After I jumped inside, it was surprisingly
easy to close the hatch from within.


66 :
Once the hatch was closed, I shut the latch
right away.

Depth‡L70 meters.


67 :
Tsugumi was stunned...

Her eyes were opened up as wide as they would
go, and she stared at me from the other side
of the glass.


{T7T140}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi! Takeshi!


{T7T141}
[Tsugumi]
"What are you doing!? Open it up! Get out of 
there!"


68 :
Tsugumi wildly pounded on the reinforced
glass with her fist.


69 :
She tried as hard as she could to pull up the
lever, but was unable to.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi... What are you saying?

[Takeshi]
"The glass is pretty thick, you know. I really 
can't hear very well."


70 :

{T7T142}
[Tsugumi]
You stupid idiot! Open it up this instant!


{T7T143}
[Tsugumi]
What are you thinking!?

Tears started falling from Tsugumi's wide-open
eyes.

Drops fell in a constant stream.


71 :
Her tears and her fist pounded against the
glass.

The glass creaked as she hit it.

Depth‡L71 meters.

[Takeshi]
Hey, wait a second, didn't you...

[Takeshi]
"I thought you knew about the Archimedes 
principle...?"

[Takeshi]
"I mean, I think you were the one who taught 
me about it."

[Takeshi]
I guess you'd know that. Sorry. Hahaha...


72 :

{T7T144}
[Tsugumi]
This isn't funny! Stop joking!


{T7T145}
[Tsugumi]
This isn't... It's not about that!


{T7T146}
[Tsugumi]
You fool... Takeshi, you idiot!

Tsugumi sobbed as she screamed.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I'm an idiot. The biggest one there is!

[Takeshi]
You didn't know that? Tsugumi...

Depth‡L72 meters.


73 :
No matter how hard she pounded on the glass,
it didn't break.

The hatch wouldn't open, and it wouldn't break
either.

It looked fairly sturdy.

It made me feel good to know that it would
hold.

[Takeshi]
Well, anyway...

[Takeshi]
"We gotta make sure this little egg stays 
afloat."

I put one hand behind me on the other hatch.

If I could open it up, she'd be safe...


74 :
I slowly turned the handle.


{T7T147}
[Tsugumi]
Ta... Takeshi...?

Tsugumi stopped hitting the glass.


{T7T148}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{T7T149}
[Tsugumi]
Do you really...


{T7T150}
[Tsugumi]
Want... to... die...?


75 :
[Takeshi]
Don't worry.

I didn't look away when I spoke to her and
said firmly...

[Takeshi]
I may be stupid, but...

[Takeshi]
I'm not that stupid.

Depth‡L73 meters.


76 :
I kept turning the handle with my other hand.

Just a little more.


{T7T151}
[Tsugumi]
Please...


{T7T152}
[Tsugumi]
Don't leave me...


{T7T153}
[Tsugumi]
Don't leave me all by myself!

[Takeshi]
There you go, always worrying...

I forced a smile.

[Takeshi]
"I keep telling you it's going to be okay, 
right?"


{T7T154}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...

[Takeshi]
You want to live, don't you...?


{T7T155}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...

[Takeshi]
So live!

[Takeshi]
As long as you're alive, live!

[Takeshi]
Don't worry...

[Takeshi]
I...

[Takeshi]
I'm not going to die.

‡L74 meters.


77 :
The hatch on the bottom of the submarine
opened.

The air which had been compressed in the
airlock was jettisoned into the ocean.

My body shot out like a bullet into the water.


78 :

{T7T156}
[Tsugumi]
........!

I could no longer hear her voice.

In the middle of the ocean, her voice
wouldn't carry to me.

On the other side of the glass, I could make
out her blurry outline.

Tsugumi's face was covered with tears, broken
with sadness...

Her image refracted through the water.


79 :
‡L75 meters.

I grabbed onto a rail on the outside of the
submarine and steadied myself.

I closed the outside hatch.

I couldn't see her anymore.

I wouldn't be able to see her again.

‡L76 meters.

I let go of my last source of support.

And kicked the sub.

Released from its support, my body went flying.


Into a jet-black ocean filled with sparkling
fragments of light.

‡L77 meters.

My consciousness was floating.

But my will steadfastly clung to my body. It
was still there.

Even if it was threatening to turn to dust.

Even if it was threatening to be torn
apart...

Live as long as you are alive.

That was what I wanted.

Maybe it was just stubbornness...

I was sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

My field of vision filled with white bubbles
heading up toward the heavens.


80 :
I closed my eyes slowly.

That was when I realized for the first time
that I was 'there'.

'I'm here.'


81 :
'I am here.'


82 :
I        a    m        h     e    r    e.

My body dissolved in the ocean, mixing with
it... becoming one with it.
