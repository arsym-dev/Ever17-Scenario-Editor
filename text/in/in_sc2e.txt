1 :
Suddenly, I was enveloped in darkness.

Plunged into darkness without a ray of light,
I heard the tinny sound of a can being kicked.

The low sound felt as though it was
penetrating my body, shaking me to my core.

Something... like an empty shell reverberating
and echoing within itself.

There was no sign that the sound would stop.

Rather, it seemed to be getting
stronger and stronger.

A crack ran down the outer husk.

It began to spread like the strands of a web
and soon covered the entire shell.

Pieces began to fall away.

Dropping... to the floor...

What I got a glimpse of through the fragmented
shell... was darkness...

The particles of light filling that darkness
began to converge on each other.


The light formed a vague image.

The image came flying into view...

A fragment of a scene familiar to me.


2 :
Kabing!


3 :
Clatter, clatter, clatter...


{S2C259}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Who kicked that?


4 :

{S2C337}
[Y¤u]
I have no idea, but...


5 :

{S2C338}
[Sara]
Now is our chance!


6 :

{S2C339}
[Sora]
Do... Do you think we should...?


7 :
As everyone spoke, they scattered like baby
spiders in the wind.

I was the only one left in the conference
room...


8 :
[Kid]
Huh?

[Kid]
'Me'!?

A chill shot up my back.


9 :

{1}{1}

{16:0x}I... I... I...{16:1}



{16:0x}I... am here...{16:1}



{16:0x}I have been here... forever...{16:1}

{16:4}

10 :
Still, I had an odd sense that something
was not quite right.

I felt that until just a while before, I was
not really myself.

'A me that is not me'.

'A me that is not me'. Who... could... that be?

I wondered why those doubts were creeping
into my mind.

I didn't know the reason.

But for some reason, I was consumed by the
feeling that I was floating in space.

A feeling that was accompanied with a
limitless terror.

It was like I had been transported into some
unknown world before I even realized it...

...That was how I felt.

Suddenly, I felt dizzy.

My consciousness seemed like it would flee if I
didn't latch firmly onto it.

I tried to do that as I calmly and carefully
analyzed the situation.

I started with what I knew...

It seemed that we were all playing kick the
can in the dark.

And thinking back on the fact that Takeshi and
everyone had run away, it seemed clear that
I was 'it'.

No, wait...

All I could think was, 'Who cared about the
game now?'

I thought it was more important to find out
the cause of that strange feeling.

I wondered why I was there in the first place.


What had I been doing?

While I had questions, there was a part of me
that felt it made total sense for me to be
there.

[Kid]
*Sigh*... This is bad...

[Kid]
"I have no idea what the deal is with 
anything..."

My mind was fuzzy. I wasn't going to be able
to push ahead with any logical thinking.

I decided to...


11 :
...Give up.

[Kid]
First, I'll go look for everyone.


12 :
I left the conference room and started my
search.

Strangely, my doubts and sense of unease
lessened with time.

I calmly went about devoting myself to
being 'it'.


13 :
In the darkness, almost completely devoid of
light, I went place to place looking for
everyone.

Y¤u, Takeshi, Sora, Sara, Tsugumi... It didn't
take me long to find all of them.

Once we were all gathered back in the
conference room, we started to talk.


14 :

{S2C351}
[Takeshi]
Geez. He slaughtered us.


{S2C352}
[Sora]
That was twice as fast as Kuranari-san.


15 :

{S2C354}
[Y¤u]
"Wow. I can't believe you guessed everybody 
right in the dark. It's pretty amazing."


16 :

{S2C355}
[Sara]
Nakkyu... What are you talking about?


17 :

{S2C356}
[Y¤u]
Oh, Mayo, you don't know? This kid...


18 :
Y¤u put her hand on my head and said something
to Sara.

Takeshi was making a fuss next to me, so I
couldn't hear what she said.


19 :

{S2C357}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Tsugumi! Give it up. Why don't you just 
come out and admit you were playing too?"


20 :

{S2C345}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not playing.

Tsugumi said it as if her patience was nearly
gone.


21 :
And that was the end of our game.

The evening continued quietly...


22 :
The day had seen no major developments.

There was nothing else for us to do, so we
decided to go to bed.

There were four legitimate beds in the dry
areas.

There was one in the compression chamber along
with two beds and an examination table in the
infirmary.

Tsugumi was missing and Sora didn't need sleep,
so there were exactly four of us.

Takeshi had been relegated to the compression
chamber as a potential danger to the women.

Y¤u and Sara had said that they would take the
two beds since they were vulnerable young women.


So I... got stuck on the hard examination table.


23 :
Then...

With the clamor having quieted down and
finding myself alone, I stared at the ceiling
and started to reflect on things.

Enough time had passed since I had that eerie
feeling of things being not right. My mind was
clear.

I was able easily to reel in the thread of
my memory.

The date was May 2nd.

It was the second day we had been trapped in
LeMU.

Our second day there was almost over.

I reflected on the happenings of those two days.


24 :
On May 1st...

{1}

I had awoken in the infirmary without
my memory.

I didn't know my name, age, address, or even
why I was there.

The person who had looked after me had been
Y¤u.

{16:4}

25 :
Trapped in LeMU, Y¤u and I had wandered
through the complex, searching for an exit.

We were caught up in a sudden rush of water
and barely escaped death. Then we found Sara
and rescued her from the elevator...

Oh, and I remembered that I had blurted out
something crazy...

{16:4}

26 :
[Kid]
I just want to make sure one more time...

[Kid]
"Sara, there was really no one riding 
in the elevator except for you?"


27 :

{C1S006}
[Sara]
Eh!?

[Kid]
So there was somebody?


{C1S007}
[Sara]
N-no... There wasn't, but...

[Kid]
But...?


28 :

{C1S008}
[Sara]
Why...?


{C1S009}
[Sara]
...How... How do you know?


{C1S010}
[Sara]
My...


{C1S011}
[Sara]
My... name...


29 :

{C1S012}
[Y¤u]
"What? Oh, that's right. We haven't told you 
Mayo's real name..."


30 :

{C1S013}
[Sara]
Hey! I asked you why!


31 :

{C1S018}
[Sara]
How do you know me!?


{C1S019}
[Sara]
Who...


32 :

{C1S020}
[Sara]
...Who are you?

She grilled me about how I knew, but I had no
answer.

Still, I knew her name was 'Matsunaga Sara'.


Even though I knew it, I still didn't know how
I knew it.

The word 'Sara' just unconsciously popped
out of my mouth.


33 :
After that...

I met with Tsugumi, Sora, and Takeshi to
contemplate escape routes.

We noticed that LeMMIH's bio scan was
displaying bizarre numbers for the
number of people in LeMU.

I had another experience similar to the one
with Sara.

{16:4}

34 :
[Kid]
"Wait! That's not right! There's something
strange about it!"

[Kid]
"There are only five people that didn't 
escape in time!"

[Kid]
But the bio scan is showing six.


35 :

{C1S119}
[Sara]
Huh? Why do you say there are five people?


36 :

{C1S120}
[Sara]
"Sora, Tsugumi, Takeshi, the Kid, Nakkyu... and
me."


{C1S121}
[Sara]
That's six.

[Kid]
No. Sara... that's wrong...


37 :
[Kid]
The thing is, Sora is...


38 :
[Kid]
Sora is...

[Kid]
She's not really here.


39 :

{C1S122}
[Sara]
She's not here...?


40 :

{C1S123}
[Takeshi]
What're you talking about, Kid?

[Kid]
Sora is... an RSD-generated image.


41 :

{C1S124}
[Sara]
Wh-what!?


42 :

{C1S125}
[Takeshi]
RSD!?

[Kid]
"It's a system that uses semiconductor lasers 
to project an image directly onto a person's 
retina."

[Kid]
"In other words, the Sora that we're seeing 
is just an image."

Sara and Takeshi's jaws dropped, and they
blinked again and again.

Being an employee of LeMU, I figured that Y¤u
had known that from the start. She didn't
look surprised, but just gazed off into
the distance.

As for Sora...


43 :

{C1S126}
[Sora]
Yes. It is exactly as Kid-san states.


{C1S127}
[Sora]
I am not flesh and blood.


{C1S128}
[Sora]
I have no form... I am merely an image.


{C1S129}
[Sora]
"My thoughts and personality are all 
controlled by an AI program."

Sora answered without looking surprised.

But the whole situation was staggering.

Because no one had told me the fact that Sora
was an RSD-generated image...


44 :
They were inexplicable, recurring
phenomena... Premonitions.

{1}

And there was an even more unbelievable scene
that I had stumbled upon.

{16:4}

45 :
In the medical compression chamber, I met with
a ghost-like young girl.

[Kid]
It's... al-alright...

[Kid]
Don't worry... Everything is alright...

[Kid]
Anyway, let's go to where everybody else is!


{C1S296}
[Young Girl]
Everybody?

[Kid]
Yeah, it's not just me.

[Kid]
There are lots of other people...


{C1S297}
[Young Girl]
Help...? Did you come to help?

[Kid]
Y-yeah... That's right.


46 :

{C1S298}
[Young Girl]
But... it's probably impossible...

[Kid]
Huh?


{C1S299}
[Young Girl]
There is... no way out anymore...

Then I suddenly said...

[Kid]
Let's go!


47 :

{C1S316}
[Young Girl]
...Uh... Where?

[Kid]
Anywhere. Let's just get out of here.


{C1S317}
[Young Girl]
Why...?

[Kid]
"Because if we stay here, £o¢o, then we'll 
probably..."

I sucked in my breath.

I knew something there was no reason I should
have known...

I didn't know why, but I knew her name.


'Yagami £o¢o'.

And then, the moment I took my eyes off of her,
£o¢o disappeared without a sound.


48 :
I lost sight of her in the compression chamber
where we had spent the night.

I met with her again the next day... In
other words, only a few hours prior to thinking
about it like I was.

After the sudden blackout, we went to fix the
generator.

{16:4}

49 :
I met up with £o¢o again in the dim light in
front of the generator room...


{C2S173}
[£o¢o]
Moon sprite shouldering a long bow.

{C2S174}
[£o¢o]
Waiting inside a dream.

{C2S175}
[£o¢o]
Tonight, a story by moonlight.

{C2S176}
[£o¢o]
Hoping the wait will be short.

{C2S177}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping curled and snug.

{C2S178}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping in mother's arms.

I didn't know why she was singing a lullaby.

Before I could ask her, she started talking.


{C2S179}
[£o¢o]
I was waiting for you.


{C2S180}
[£o¢o]
I waited and waited... for you to come...


{C2S181}
[£o¢o]
"I was waiting... all alone like a moon 
sprite..."

[Kid]
Th-then you should have come to me...


{C2S182}
[£o¢o]
I couldn't...


{C2S183}
[£o¢o]
That's... impossible...

[Kid]
Why...?


{C2S184}
[£o¢o]
Because you wouldn't take me with you...

[Kid]
...What?


{C2S185}
[£o¢o]
Will you take me to where everybody is?

[Kid]
"Of course I will! Let's go together right 
now!"

Just as I said that...


50 :
‡LSplash!

A wall of water exploded from near £o¢o's feet.


51 :
Droplets of water scattered everywhere like
mist...


{C2S186}
[£o¢o]
Farewell.


52 :
£o¢o disappeared in the spray.


53 :
Then night came, and we decided to play
kick the can in the dark.

Takeshi was 'it' again and again, but finally,
my turn came.

I had found everyone, one after another,
in the dark...

{16:4}

54 :
When only Tsugumi was left, the sound of the
can being kicked rang throughout the
conference room...

And, just that moment, I had felt that
something was not right.

{16:4}

55 :
[Kid]
"It's only been two days, and so much 
has happened..."

[Kid]
"Just being trapped here is an unusual state 
of affairs..."

The premonitions... and the ghost-like girl...

And besides that...

Y¤u's father had gone missing, Tsugumi...
well, she was just plain rude, Sora was only
an image, and Sara...

Sara... Well... What was with Sara?

Something about her stuck in my mind.

But... Oh, whatever.

Anyway, the events of the previous two days
had been like a roller coaster.

Just too many things had happened...

It was like they said about water mills‡Lthey
worked best in a fast stream but stopped when
there was a flood.

The way I felt was like that. I couldn't get
my mind around the intense rush of events,
doubts, and questions that had forced
themselves on me.

They were beyond what I could digest.

I wondered what I could do about it.

My body knew what the best thing to do was.


Sleep. I needed to rest my mind.

Before I knew it, my consciousness was violently
assaulted and dragged down by drowsiness.

.........

......

...

But I was only briefly able to enjoy my visit.
