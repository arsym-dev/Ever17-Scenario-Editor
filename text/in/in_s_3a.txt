1 :
‡LSplash!

I scooped up water with both hands and
splashed it on my face.

The instant it made contact, it sent a sharp
shock to my brain.

[Kid]
Gaaaah!

I snapped open my eyes, completely awake.

I thought I had (probably) repeated that
ritual several thousands of times. It was my
way of refreshing myself in the morning.

I lifted my face and wiped it with the towel.

A smooth white counter, a sink... and a finely
cracked mirror.

I stared foggily at my reflection in the
mirror.

2 :
I passed Takeshi as I was returning to the
corridor.

[Kid]
Hey.

3 :

{S3A000}
[Takeshi]
...Oh, mornin', Kid.

[Kid]
Hey, don't look so depressed, Takeshi.

{S3A001}
[Takeshi]
I'm still sleepy.

[Kid]
"Well, a lot's happened in the last couple 
of days. Are you worn out?"

4 :

{S3A002}
[Takeshi]
"I'm alright. I just need to freshen up, that's all. 
See ya."

5 :
Saying that, he headed off to the bathroom.

6 :
Sara and Y¤u were waiting in the conference
room.

7 :

{S3A003}
[Y¤u]
GOOD MORNING!

{S3A004}
[Sara]
GOOD MOOOORNING!

The two of them seemed wired.

[Kid]
Morning...

8 :

{S3A005}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kid. You don't seem very well. You 
having trouble waking up?"

[Kid]
No. I'm awake.

9 :

{S3A006}
[Y¤u]
You sure?

{S3A007}
[Sara]
"I know, he's not a morning person, or maybe 
he's got low blood pressure like me."

[Kid]
I don't know about that...

Sara sure didn't seem to have a problem with
mornings.

I was just glad that Sara appeared to be in a
good mood.

10 :

{S3A008}
[Sara]
"I know all about it. I hate mornings. They're 
like hell on earth. I've destroyed more 
alarm clocks than I can count..."

11 :

{S3A009}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo is always in the worst mood in the 
morning. I thought she might kill me today."

12 :

{S3A010}
[Sara]
But Nakkyu got me in this wrestling hold...

13 :

{S3A011}
[Y¤u]
Enough. There are children around.

14 :
...I was getting a headache.

Maybe it WAS low blood pressure that made me
not a morning person...

......

Finally, when Takeshi came back, conversation
turned to breakfast.

15 :

{S3A012}
[Takeshi]
"Tsugumi and Sora aren't here. You sure it's 
okay?"

{S3A013}
[Y¤u]
"That's true... but they'll probably show up 
eventually."

16 :

{S3A014}
[Takeshi]
"Yeah, knowing those two, you're probably 
right."

17 :
We all made our way to the kiosk.

18 :

{S3A015}
[Takeshi]
Everyone okay with hotdogs?

19 :

{S3A016}
[Sara]
Hotdogs?

{S3A017}
[Y¤u]
They have hotdogs here?

20 :

{S3A018}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I found a few in the back of the 
fridge. Must've been on the stealth menu."

21 :
With that, Takeshi disappeared inside the
kiosk.

It looked like Takeshi would be chef for
another day.

But...

{S3A019}
[Takeshi]
What in the...?

Takeshi had let out a surprised yelp from
inside.

Looking into the shop, there was Takeshi,
frozen in front of the freezer with the door
open.

[Kid]
What's wrong?

22 :

{S3A020}
[Takeshi]
What's wrong is they're gone!

{S3A021}
[Sara]
Gone? What are?

{S3A022}
[Takeshi]
"The stuff. The hotdog stuff. The sausages 
that were in here are gone."

23 :

{S3A023}
[Y¤u]
I'll bet they weren't there to start with.

24 :

{S3A024}
[Takeshi]
"No. They were here when I checked last night. 
I found them when I made dinner last night."

[Kid]
You think they were stolen?

25 :

{S3A025}
[Sara]
By whom?

[Kid]
I dunno...


26 :

{S3A026}
[Takeshi]
Damn! Who would do something like that?

Takeshi slammed the door violently shut.


27 :

{S3A027}
[Y¤u]
"Calm down. We're not out of food. We'll just 
go with the regular menu."


28 :

{S3A028}
[Takeshi]
Geez...


29 :

{S3A029}
[Y¤u]
"Just forget about it and start cookiiiing. 
I'm starviiiing."


30 :

{S3A030}
[Sara]
Me too.


31 :
Y¤u and I were of the same opinion.

We weren't expecting hotdogs to begin
with... and I was hungry.

Takeshi still looked peeved. Maybe it was
because he was hungry too.

The first thing we had to do was fill our
stomachs.

In the end, we gave up on hotdogs and went
with our standby menu (tuna sandwiches)
for breakfast.


32 :
When everyone had a Takeshi-made sandwich in
hand, we sat down for a lively and fun
breakfast together.

Y¤u and Sara were especially boisterous.

Takeshi said that the two of them easily made
as much noise as three or more people.


But that was just Takeshi being himself...

The two of them never seemed to run out of
things to talk about and kept jabbering away
cheerfully about the most meaningless things.


33 :

{S3A031}
[Sara]
"Hey, Nakkyu. Do you remember Konishi, 
that teacher at our school?"


34 :

{S3A032}
[Y¤u]
"Konishi? Oh, you mean Konnie? The music 
teacher who was built like a tank and a 
completely crazy animal lover."


35 :

{S3A033}
[Sara]
Yeah. That Konnie.


36 :

{S3A034}
[Y¤u]
He's still there. He's been around for ages.


37 :

{S3A035}
[Sara]
"You know what? The other day, he bought a 
robotic dog."


38 :

{S3A036}
[Y¤u]
No kidding? He did? That mechanophobe?


39 :

{S3A037}
[Sara]
"Yeah. His pets kept dying on him. And 
he'd take time off... I think it just wore him 
down."


40 :

{S3A038}
[Y¤u]
"When I was still going to that school, he was 
trying to bring one of his pets back through 
cloning."


{S3A039}
[Sara]
"But that clone got sick and died too. I 
swear he's cursed."


{S3A040}
[Y¤u]
"But really, that Konnie... I tell you, that 
robot dog looks so much like the real thing 
that I'll bet he's treating it like a normal pet."


41 :

{S3A041}
[Sara]
"Hey, didn't you have a robotic dog at your 
house?"


42 :

{S3A042}
[Y¤u]
Yup, sure do. Actually, it's my mom's.


43 :

{S3A043}
[Y¤u]
"I think it's one of those really old types, 
but it just keeps ticking along happily. It 
never breaks."


44 :

{S3A044}
[Y¤u]
"Thinking back on it, Mayo, you never came 
over to my house to play, did you? You have to 
next time. I'll show it to you."


45 :

{S3A045}
[Sara]
Really? Sounds good. If I get a chance...


46 :

{S3A046}
[Y¤u]
"You can come over any time. We're friends, 
right?"


47 :

{S3A047}
[Sara]
Yes... Of course.


48 :

{S3A048}
[Takeshi]
Hey, can I ask you something?


49 :
Just then, Takeshi jumped into their
conversation.


50 :

{S3A049}
[Y¤u]
Eh? What?


{S3A050}
[Takeshi]
"You two seem to be close, but how do you know 
each other?"


51 :

{S3A051}
[Y¤u]
Oh? We didn't tell you?

Takeshi shook his head as he gulped down cola.

[Kid]
"Y¤u and Sara are from the same school. Y¤u 
graduated already."

[Kid]
"I think she said she was at Kyumeikan Girls' 
High School until this last March..."


52 :
I answered for them, but Y¤u nodded.


53 :
And when Y¤u was a senior, Sara entered the
school as a scholarship student, Y¤u added.


54 :
[Kid]
A scholarship student?

I'd never heard of that before.


55 :

{S3A054}
[Takeshi]
"Do... Do you mean one of those people that 
sneaks in the back door?"


56 :

{S3A055}
[Y¤u]
"You always have such a twisted take on 
everything."


57 :

{S3A056}
[Takeshi]
"No I don't! I'm not half as mean-spirited as 
you."


58 :

{S3A057}
[Sara]
"Due to my situation at home, I never really 
planned on going to high school..."


59 :

{S3A058}
[Sara]
"But the principal of Kyumeikan was a friend 
of the family and helped get me in as a 
scholarship student."


60 :

{S3A060}
[Y¤u]
"He didn't want her unpolished genius to go to 
waste."

It sounded like Sara was a bit of a prodigy
and sort of famous.


{S3A061}
[Takeshi]
Whoa.

[Kid]
S-Sara's amazing.

That and the information from the day before
about Sara's computer skills made me think
that she might be on a different level
than the rest of us.


61 :

{S3A062}
[Sara]
It's no...


{S3A063}
[Sara]
It's no big deal. Really.


62 :
Sara looked bored as she said it.

Maybe it was no big deal for her...


63 :

{S3A064}
[Takeshi]
"So you went to the same school but were in 
different classes?"


{S3A065}
[Takeshi]
"Were you on a team or in a club together or 
something?"


{S3A066}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


64 :

{S3A067}
[Sara]
"Nakkyu was leader of the school club I joined 
as a freshman."

After eating the sandwiches, Sara held the cola
can with both hands and gazed at the ceiling
with a distant look in her eyes.


65 :

{S3A068}
[Sara]
That was a year ago.


{S3A069}
[Sara]
Right after I had entered Kyumeikan...


66 :
......

......

......


67 :
It was a sunny spring afternoon after class.

A light wind made the cherry blossoms dance in
the schoolyard, and dust gently tickled the
nose.

There were groups of new students walking
in starched new school uniforms, full of
nervousness and expectations.


There were senior students eagerly calling out
to them to join their clubs.

It was probably a scene played out on most
school campuses.

As I let my imagination run wild, I was looking
around the campus and trying to get a feel for my
new surroundings.

All of a sudden, from among the din of
voices and activity, someone called out to me.


{S3A070}
[???]
Hey, you there!

I stopped.

Looking in the direction of the voice was a
girl student, her face one big smile.

From the ribbon on her uniform, it was clear
she was a senior.

Her hair was cut short enough that it just hid
her ears. It also made her look like a
go-getter.

When I pointed at myself to see if she meant
me, she nodded, smiling.


{S3A071}
[???]
Yeah. I mean you.

The smiling girl approached me.


{S3A072}
[???]
Do you have a minute? Sure you do, right?


{S3A073}
[???]
If you're up for it, can I talk with you?


{S3A074}
[???]
Don't worry. It won't take much of your time.

What was it with her? I wondered if
she was trying to pick me up... or...

I had a bad feeling about the situation.

Seeing my skeptical face, the girl with the
bobbed haircut tried to explain herself.


{S3A075}
[???]
"Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to... I 
simply wanted to..."


{S3A076}
[???]
"I was just wondering if you would like to 
join our club."

...So that was it. I wonder how many people
had asked me the same question.

I was pretty sick of the whole thing.


{S3A077}
[Sara]
No thank you. I'm not interested.


{S3A078}
[???]
"Oh, really? Have you already decided to join 
somewhere?"


{S3A079}
[Sara]
No.


{S3A080}
[???]
Well then!


{S3A081}
[Sara]
I've decided not to join anything.


{S3A082}
[???]
"Oh, don't say that... Won't you just come take 
a look at our club room?"


{S3A083}
[Sara]
No thank you.


{S3A084}
[???]
"I'll bet you're wondering what our club is 
all about."

{S3A085}
[Sara]
Not in the least.

{S3A086}
[???]
"Okay, okay. Just come take a look. We don't 
bite."

{S3A087}
[Sara]
I said...


{S3A088}
[???]
"Listen! Stop talking, shut up, and come with 
me!"

So that persistent senior dragged me to their
club room half by force.


68 :
[Kid]
So Y¤u... was that girl?


{S3A089}
[Sara]
You got it.


69 :

{S3A090}
[Takeshi]
"She hasn't changed a bit. I mean, you're 
exactly the same, Y¤u."


70 :

{S3A091}
[Y¤u]
"Be quiet. I was desperate then. There was 
nothing else I could do!"

[Kid]
Why were you so eager to get Sara to join?


71 :

{S3A092}
[Y¤u]
"It... It was a matter of life or death for the 
club."


72 :
[Kid]
?


{S3A093}
[Y¤u]
It could have been the end of us.

[Kid]
?


73 :

{S3A094}
[Sara]
"She means they were short on members and were 
about to fold."


74 :

{S3A095}
[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.


75 :

{S3A096}
[Sara]
"I mean, including Nakkyu, there were only 
three members."


{S3A097}
[Takeshi]
Hahaha! That's pretty grim.


{S3A098}
[Y¤u]
"I was going to graduate that year, so we had 
to get new members or we would have had to 
close."


{S3A099}
[Y¤u]
"I just couldn't stand by and watch the club 
that we had built go to waste."


76 :

{S3A100}
[Takeshi]
Well, I guess I see what you mean.


77 :

{S3A101}
[Y¤u]
"So, it was the only choice I had if our club 
was going to survive."

[Kid]
So exactly what kind of club was it?


78 :

{S3A102}
[Y¤u]
"We were a robust model of an intelligent 
beacon of education while working in the 
public interest."


79 :

{S3A103}
[Takeshi]
Wow...

Takeshi took a swig of his cola.


{S3A104}
[Takeshi]
And? What did you guys do?


80 :

{S3A105}
[Y¤u]
We were hackers.


81 :

{S3A106}
[Takeshi]
*Cough*...!

82 :

{S3A107}
[Y¤u]
"Geez! That's gross... You spewed soda 
everywhere!"


83 :

{S3A108}
[Takeshi]
"Stupid! Hacking is not robust and certainly 
isn't in 'the public interest'!"


{S3A109}
[Y¤u]
What are you talking about?


{S3A110}
[Takeshi]
It's a crime, that's why.


{S3A111}
[Y¤u]
"You don't know what you're talking about! 
Hacking isn't a crime!"


84 :

{S3A112}
[Takeshi]
Huh? You sure?


85 :
Takeshi looked at me.

His eyes said, 'What the heck is she talking
about?'

86 :
{11:0-61}
{11:1}I get it

{11:1}I have no clue


87 :
Oh well... I figured that I'd have to explain
it.

[Kid]
Takeshi, listen.

[Kid]
"Originally, 'hacking' as a word meant the 
rhythmical manipulation of a computer."

[Kid]
"People that could do this were called 
'hackers'. That evolved into the word 'hacker' for 
technicians and research computer experts."

[Kid]
"What you're probably thinking about is the 
'hacking' they talk about on the news, meaning a 
crime committed using a computer..."

[Kid]
"Like when somebody steals secret information 
or destroys data via computer..."


88 :
[Kid]
But that's a mistake.

[Kid]
"That kind of thing is called 'cracking'. It's 
completely different."

[Kid]
"And the people that do this are known as 
'crackers'. You need to make a distinction 
between them."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Uh, what's the matter, everybody?


{S3A113}
[Sara]
Hey, Kid...


{S3A114}
[Takeshi]
Are you sure you've lost your memory?


89 :

{S3A115}
[Y¤u]
"Well... Anyway, you get it now. There's 
really no connection whatsoever between the 
word 'hacking' and criminal activity."


90 :
Of course, I had no clue.


91 :

{S3A116}
[Y¤u]
"Geez... Mayo, explain it so that this idiot 
can understand it."


92 :

{S3A117}
[Sara]
Okay.


93 :
Sara cleared her throat, put on her
explanation face, and started speaking.


{S3A118}
[Sara]
"Originally, 'hacking' as a word meant the 
rhythmical manipulation of a computer."


{S3A119}
[Sara]
"People that could do this were called 
'hackers'. That evolved into the word 'hacker' for 
technicians and research computer experts."


94 :

{S3A120}
[Sara]
"What you're probably thinking about is the 
'hacking' they talk about on the news, meaning a 
crime committed using a computer..."


{S3A121}
[Sara]
"Like when somebody steals secret information 
or destroys data via computer..."


{S3A122}
[Sara]
But that's a mistake.


95 :

{S3A123}
[Sara]
"That kind of thing is called 'cracking'. It's 
completely different."


{S3A124}
[Sara]
"And the people that do this are known as 
'crackers'. You need to make a distinction 
between them."


96 :

{S3A125}
[Sara]
There you go!


97 :
Y¤u clapped loudly.


98 :

{S3A126}
[Y¤u]
"Got it? There's really no connection 
whatsoever between the word 'hacking' and 
criminal activity."


99 :

{S3A127}
[Y¤u]
"It was an intelligent gathering for us to 
gather to try to boost our computer skills."


100 :

{S3A128}
[Takeshi]
Oops. Excuse my ignorance!

[Kid]
"I'm just surprised that Y¤u was involved in 
an indoor club."


101 :

{S3A129}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, I was doing all kinds of things. All 
said... I must have been involved with seven 
groups."

[Kid]
Wow... I see.


102 :

{S3A130}
[Takeshi]
And Sara just joined right up then, huh?


{S3A131}
[Sara]
Nope.


103 :
[Kid]
You didn't?


104 :

{S3A132}
[Y¤u]
"She didn't join the club without a fight. 
Mayo is Mayo, after all."

With that ambiguous comment, Y¤u got a distant
look in her eye and started to speak.


105 :

{S3A133}
[Y¤u]
"That day, I could have taken Mayo to our club 
room..."


{S3A134}
[Y¤u]
But... But...


106 :
......

......

......


107 :
‡LSlide.


108 :

{S3A135}
[Y¤u]
So this is our hacking club room. Go on in.

[Matsunaga]
...


{S3A136}
[Y¤u]
"Huh? What's the matter? It's kind of cramped, 
but go ahead."


{S3A137}
[Matsunaga]
It really is... cramped.


{S3A138}
[Y¤u]
Well, I suppose.


{S3A139}
[Matsunaga]
And you have tons of stuff.


{S3A140}
[Y¤u]
I suppose.


{S3A141}
[Matsunaga]
I mean, there's no way I'll fit in here.


{S3A142}
[Y¤u]
I suppose not... Ahaha.

Like always, our little one-room clubroom was
so cluttered that there was nowhere to even walk.

Several computers and a steel rack covered the
three walls, and the floor was covered in a
tangle of cables.

In what open space there was, computers
without covers and bound-up printouts were
piled high.

A stuffed animal bumblebee, a button with a
picture of a nuclear missile blasting off, an
unidentified object X, and other things were
scattered around, almost completely covering
the floor.

If Matsunaga-san had been a clean freak, we
would have lost her right there.


{S3A143}
[???]
Oh? Nakkyu, is that a new member?

A girl stood from in front of a computer, her
chair nearly buried.


She was the head of the club. She always wore
glasses with black frames and kept her hair in
two braids.

Her name was... Uh... I forgot.


{S3A144}
[Y¤u]
"That's right. We just barely avoided having 
our club fold..."

As I answered her, I hopped from one floor tile to
the next as if they were stepping stones and
jumped into the room.


{S3A145}
[Matsunaga]
Um, I, uh, haven't decided to join yet...

Matsunaga-san was still contemplating how best to
enter the room.


{S3A146}
[Y¤u]
So where is your partner?


{S3A147}
[Club President]
Out with a cold.


{S3A148}
[Y¤u]
"I heard one is going around. You gotta be 
careful."


{S3A149}
[Matsunaga]
"Hanging out in a place like this, it'd be even 
more strange if you didn't get ill..."

Matsunaga-san gingerly entered the room as if
searching for one foothold and then another.

Every step she took, her footsteps were
punctuated with a crunching noise, as if
something was breaking. Of course, we didn't
pay any attention to it.


{S3A150}
[Y¤u]
"Okay. Now is your chance to get a sense of 
what our club is all about. Please sit down."

I unearthed a chair from the pile of junk and
gestured to Matsunaga-san to sit.


{S3A151}
[Matsunaga]
I'm only here to look.


{S3A152}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright. If you still have doubts, 
just give it a try. It's pretty fun."


{S3A153}
[Matsunaga]
Can I ask you something first?


{S3A154}
[Y¤u]
Anything.


{S3A155}
[Matsunaga]
This is a hacking club, right?


{S3A156}
[Y¤u]
Right.


{S3A157}
[Matsunaga]
"But it looks like the only thing on the 
screens are games."


{S3A158}
[Y¤u]
Uh, well, that's true...

I crossed my arms and nodded seriously several
times.


{S3A159}
[Y¤u]
"Actually, we just call ourselves a hacking 
club. None of our current members can really 
program."


{S3A160}
[Club President]
Everybody that could already graduated.

[Matsunaga]
.........


{S3A161}
[Y¤u]
"Even games can have meaning. Uh, they aren't 
bad for helping you get used to computers..."


{S3A162}
[Matsunaga]
Um...


{S3A163}
[Y¤u]
Yes? What is it?


{S3A164}
[Matsunaga]
"I'll be up front about this. Getting involved 
with me will only get you into trouble."

[Y¤u]
.........


{S3A165}
[Matsunaga]
I mean...


{S3A166}
[Y¤u]
Ahh, what's this kid going on about?


{S3A167}
[Y¤u]
"Look, we're in danger of losing our club as it 
is... Nothing could be WORSE than you not 
joining."


{S3A168}
[Matsunaga]
Do you mind if I touch this?

Matsunaga-san pointed at the keyboard.


{S3A169}
[Y¤u]
Oh, be my guest. You operate it by, um...


{S3A170}
[Matsunaga]
I'm fine. I know how to use it.

She sat in the chair, took the mouse, and
stared at the monitor.

She opened several files. Finding the one she
was looking for, she opened it up and started
editing it.


109 :
She didn't even glance at the keyboard. She
just tapped nonstop.

The speed of her touch-typing was incredible.


{S3A171}
[Y¤u]
Wow!


{S3A172}
[Club President]
Amazing...

When she had finished typing, Matsunaga-san
opened a different piece of software and started
typing in commands.

The hard disk whirred to life, and finally...


{S3A173}
[Y¤u]
Wow!

Suddenly, the face of a bumblebee appeared on
all of the monitors in the room.

That face stared out at us and winked. Then
all of the faces stuck out their tongues at us.


{S3A174}
[Y¤u]
Wh-wh-what...!


{S3A175}
[Club President]
"What's going on? I can't get this computer to 
listen to me...!?"

The next instant...


110 :
Snap!

All of the computers suddenly shut down at
once.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Club President]
.........

The two of us stood there, stunned.

Finished, Matsunaga-san stood up and said quietly...


{S3A176}
[Matsunaga]
You get it now?


{S3A177}
[Matsunaga]
Nothing good can come of hooking up with me.


{S3A178}
[Matsunaga]
So... don't.

And then she left.


{S3A179}
[Club President]
What in the...?


{S3A180}
[Y¤u]
What happened?


{S3A181}
[Club President]
The computer won't boot up.


{S3A182}
[Y¤u]
You sure it's not unplugged?


{S3A183}
[Club President]
"That's not it... It's plugged in, but it won't 
start up."


{S3A184}
[Y¤u]
Huh...?

She meant that the software had been destroyed.

And the problem wasn't limited to just one
machine.

All of the computers in that room that were
connected to the network were in the same
state.


{S3A185}
[Y¤u]
No way. That girl...


{S3A186}
[Y¤u]
"Could she have cracked the whole system that 
quickly?"

Looking down, there was a stuffed bumblebee
glaring up nastily at me.


111 :

{S3A187}
[Takeshi]
No kidding...?


{S3A188}
[Y¤u]
No kidding.

[Kid]
.........


112 :

{S3A189}
[Takeshi]
Geez. That's crazy.


{S3A190}
[Sara]
"Well, Nakkyu was so persistent that it was 
annoying!"


113 :

{S3A191}
[Takeshi]
Y-yeah, but you didn't have to...

[Kid]
So Sara didn't join?

[Kid]
What? Then that would mean that...


114 :

{S3A192}
[Y¤u]
"No, it's the opposite. I didn't say she 
didn't join, did I?"


115 :

{S3A193}
[Sara]
"After that, Nakkyu came bothering me, like, 
every day."

[Kid]
Even though she did that to your computers?


{S3A194}
[Y¤u]
Because she did that.


116 :
Basically, Y¤u had been taken by Sara's genius.


By her genius for programming.

Day after day, her fixation drove her to call
on Sara.

Finally, Sara was overwhelmed by Y¤u's
enthusiasm and joined the club.


117 :

{S3A195}
[Y¤u]
That was how Mayo and I became friends.


118 :

{S3A196}
[Sara]
Okey-dokey!


119 :
With that long, long story finally over, we
all stretched.


120 :

{S3A197}
[Takeshi]
"Well, we finished eating. Whaddya say? Should 
we head back to the conference room?"

[Kid]
Sure.


121 :
Tsugumi hadn't eaten, but there was no point
in waiting around for her.

We took her sandwich back to the conference
room.


122 :

{S3A198}
[Y¤u]
I'm going to step out for a bit.


123 :

{S3A199}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Where to?


124 :

{S3A200}
[Y¤u]
Uh, just a little walk...

[Kid]
?


125 :

{S3A201}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, you keep poking your nose into a girl's 
privacy and she just might start disliking 
you."

Y¤u shrugged and patted me on the head.


126 :

{S3A202}
[Sara]
What about me?


127 :

{S3A203}
[Y¤u]
Sorry, Mayo, but I think I'll go alone.


128 :

{S3A204}
[Sara]
Okay...


129 :

{S3A205}
[Y¤u]
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.


130 :
Y¤u shot the dejected Sara a smile as she
headed quickly toward the door.


{S3A206}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, I don't care where you go, but if 
something happens, you come right back!"

Y¤u shot Takeshi a thumbs up on the way out
the door.


131 :
She was on the way to the conference room.


132 :
[Kid]
Ah...!

I looked up at the ceiling.

[Kid]
Wh-what's that...?

I had thought I had seen something for a
second.

But when I had done a double take, I didn't see
anything.


133 :

{S3A207}
[Takeshi]
H-hey, what's wrong?

Even with Takeshi calling out to me, I
couldn't tear my eyes from the ceiling.

[Kid]
I wonder...

[Kid]
"I don't know what it was, but I swear I saw 
something."


{S3A208}
[Takeshi]
Saw something? Like what?

[Kid]
Uhh... Well, I didn't really see it...

[Kid]
"I just have a bad feeling... about the second 
floor... somewhere."


134 :

{S3A209}
[Takeshi]
What the heck are you talking about?

[Kid]
"Um, I think we should check that floor one 
more time..."


135 :
Saying that, Takeshi slapped me on the shoulder.

Suddenly, I came back to myself.


136 :

{S3A210}
[Takeshi]
"Don't worry about it. If something's up, Sora 
would warn us about it, right?"

[Kid]
Yeah... You're right... but still...


{S3A211}
[Takeshi]
Looks like I'm not the only one who's tired.

[Kid]
Yeah...


137 :
I wondered if that was really all it was.

I tried to remember what I had seen while I
was walking.

But it was like waking up after a dream and
having the dream slip away... I couldn't
remember it.


138 :
When we returned to the conference room,
Tsugumi was there.

And to our surprise, she was eating.

[Kid]
Oh!


139 :

{S3A212}
[Sara]
Oh my!


{S3A213}
[Takeshi]
Ahhhh!


140 :
The reason we were all so surprised...

Was because...

Tsugumi was eating a... hotdog.


[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


141 :

{S3A214}
[Tsugumi]
What?


142 :

{S3A215}
[Takeshi]
You... You... You...

[Tsugumi]
.........


143 :

{S3A216}
[Takeshi]
You thief!


{S3A217}
[Tsugumi]
What're you so mad about?

Tsugumi was indifferent.


144 :
That just served to fuel Takeshi's fury.


{S3A218}
[Takeshi]
"I thought everyone was sick of tuna 
sandwiches... and here I was going to 
make... and you... you...!"

[Kid]
Just... calm down.

I tried to calm him down.

But Tsugumi just continued to munch on her
hotdog without a care.


{S3A219}
[Sara]
"I think that's pretty selfish of you to keep 
them all to yourself."


145 :

{S3A220}
[Takeshi]
You selfish pig!


{S3A221}
[Takeshi]
"I hope you get fat like a whale and drown in 
the Mariana Trench, you hog!"


{S3A222}
[Tsugumi]
All to myself?

Tsugumi polished off the last bite and turned
to face Takeshi as she wiped her hands.


146 :

{S3A223}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm not sure what you're talking about. This 
is the only one I ate."


147 :

{S3A224}
[Takeshi]
"What? When I looked, there was enough for 
everyone."


{S3A225}
[Takeshi]
"And now they're all gone. In that soon-to-be 
fat stomach of yours!"


148 :

{S3A226}
[Tsugumi]
"Well... I didn't really count how many there 
were."


149 :

{S3A227}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe the rats got them.


{S3A228}
[Takeshi]
You pathetic liar! The only rat here is you!

Takeshi's fury only grew while Tsugumi stayed
calm.

She brushed away the hair from her forehead
and stood up quietly.


150 :

{S3A229}
[Tsugumi]
"I'll ask you one more time. Why are you so 
mad?"


151 :

{S3A230}
[Takeshi]
"I told you! It's because you ate everyone's 
food."


{S3A231}
[Tsugumi]
And I told you this was all I ate.


152 :

{S3A232}
[Tsugumi]
Besides...

Tsugumi glared at Takeshi.


{S3A233}
[Tsugumi]
"Are you sure that's the real reason that you're 
angry?"


153 :

{S3A234}
[Takeshi]
What? What are you talking about?


154 :

{S3A235}
[Tsugumi]
"You sure it wasn't just because it threw off 
your schedule?"


155 :
[Kid]
?

Schedule...?


156 :

{S3A236}
[Takeshi]
"We-well yeah! Because the hotdogs that I 
wanted everyone to eat are gone now!"

Tsugumi stared unflinchingly at Takeshi.

The two glared at each other.

Sara and I were in no position to step in
between the two. All we could do was watch to
see what happened.


157 :
It was then that‡L


158 :
Suddenly, a low metallic sound reverberated
throughout the complex.

It was a dull, muffled sound.


159 :

{S3A237}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what was that!?


160 :

{S3A238}
[Tsugumi]
This whole place just shook... a little.


161 :
The two turned their attention to the new
situation, forgetting their fight.


162 :

{S3A239}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid, what was that?

[Kid]
Uh, I don't know...


{S3A240}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, this doesn't have anything to do with 
that 'bad feeling' you had earlier, does it?"


163 :
I shook my head.

[Kid]
I don't know. Maybe we should ask Sora...


164 :

{T3A064}
[Sora]
Did you call for me?


165 :
From out of nowhere, Sora appeared in midair
and floated down in front of us.


166 :

{S3A241}
[Sara]
Oh, Sora!


167 :

{S3A242}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora! Where were you?


168 :

{T3A066}
[Sora]
I'm terribly sorry. I overslept.

Sora looked embarrassed.


169 :

{S3A243}
[Takeshi]
Overslept? But you're...


170 :

{S3A244}
[Takeshi]
...Nah, we'll save that for later.


171 :
[Kid]
"Hey, did something just happen? There was an 
awful noise just now."


172 :

{T3A068}
[Sora]
"One of the shafts that supports this floor 
has started to warp."


173 :
[Kid]
We didn't see any signs of it yesterday...


{T3A070}
[Sora]
Yes, well, it wasn't in my calculations. It appears as if the ocean currents may have caused it.


174 :

{S3A245}
[Takeshi]
How dangerous are we talking here?


175 :

{T3A071}
[Sora]
"Well it should be within the margin of error, 
but... No, wait a second."


176 :

{T3A072}
[Sora]
"There is an anomaly in one of the 
pressure-regulating pipes at Zweiter 
Stock's warehouse."


{S3A246}
[Takeshi]
What are pressure-regulating pipes?


177 :

{T3A073}
[Sora]
"These pipelines are responsible for adjusting 
the pressure inside the multi-layered 
bulkheads comprising LeMU."


{T3A074}
[Sora]
"If any of them should rupture, for whatever 
reason, I am incapable of repairing them."


{T3A075}
[Sora]
"The anomaly is only slight, so you shouldn't have to
hurry, but... I think it is best if someone goes to check
on it. Would you please go for me?"


178 :

{S3A247}
[Takeshi]
Sure, leave it to me.

Takeshi volunteered right away.


{S3A248}
[Tsugumi]
...I guess that's that, then.


179 :
[Kid]
What?

I couldn't quite make out what Tsugumi had
said. Then...


180 :

{S3A249}
[Tsugumi]
I'll go too.

She unexpectedly volunteered for the task.


181 :

{S3A250}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi...


{S3A251}
[Tsugumi]
"What? You got a problem with me tagging 
along?"


182 :

{S3A252}
[Takeshi]
No... That's not it... It's just...


183 :

{S3A253}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't get me wrong. We've got a situation on 
our hands, so you and I will call a truce."


{S3A254}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, if we're going to fix something, we'll 
need tools, right? I know my way around a 
workshop."


184 :

{S3A255}
[Takeshi]
Alright... Let's go.


185 :

{S3A256}
[Sara]
I'll help too.


{S3A257}
[Takeshi]
Okay, you can come too, Sara.


186 :

{S3A258}
[Takeshi]
"So what happened with Y¤u, anyway? She's not 
back yet?"

[Kid]
"I wonder if she didn't notice the shaking 
just now."


187 :

{S3A259}
[Sora]
There's no way she could have missed that...

[Kid]
Do you know where she is?


188 :

{S3A260}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry. Unfortunately, some sensors are 
out of order right now. I can't scan the 
whole complex."


189 :
(I wonder what happened to Y¤u.)


190 :

{S3A261}
[Sara]
Hey, Kid. Will you go look for Nakkyu?


191 :
[Kid]
Huh? Me?


{S3A262}
[Sara]
Yeah. I'm a little worried about her.

[Kid]
...

I was also worried about Sara and everyone
going off suddenly like that.

An extra set of hands couldn't hurt...


192 :
I had to decide what to do.

193 :
{11:0-63}
{11:1}Look for Y¤u

{11:1}Repairs with Sara


194 :
[Kid]
"Takeshi, I'll come along and help with the 
repairs."


195 :

{S3A263}
[Sara]
What about Nakkyu?

[Kid]
"Y¤u's tougher than the rest of us. She'll be 
fine."


196 :
[Kid]
"Besides, if something was wrong, she would 
use LeMMIH to contact us."


197 :

{S3A264}
[Sara]
"But if something happened to her during that 
shaking..."


198 :

{S3A265}
[Sora]
You needn't worry about that.


{S3A266}
[Sora]
"Currently, there appears to be no direct 
damage inside LeMU."


{S3A267}
[Sora]
"As for Tanaka-san's whereabouts, the sensors
should be online in a moment, and then I will be
able to detect her."


{S3A268}
[Takeshi]
"Alright. We'll forget about Y¤u for now. 
Let's go check the warehouse, and then we'll 
worry about everything else."


{S3A269}
[Sara]
Alright...

[Kid]
She's fine. I promise.

Promise? How could I promise that?

But somehow, I was sure of it.


199 :

{S3A270}
[Sara]
Okay.

With that one word, the tension seemed to
leave Sara.


{S3A271}
[Tsugumi]
"What are you doing? You're gonna get left 
behind."


200 :
The next thing I noticed, we were the only
people left in the room.

Sara and I chased after everyone.


201 :
[Kid]
Takeshi, I'll go have a look around for Y¤u.


202 :

{S3A272}
[Takeshi]
Alright. It's in your hands then, Kid.


203 :

{S3A273}
[Sora]
If something comes up, use LeMMIH to contact me.

[Kid]
Alright. See you later!


204 :
I ran through the corridor, kicking up spray as
I went.
