1 :
I walked around LeMU.

After what had happened, I didn't want to be
around Y¤u or Takeshi.

But I was too worked up to just stick around
in one place.

I thought I would pick the place they were
least likely to come and wander around it.

I wondered what that fit of rage had been
about...

Why had I gotten so mad...?

Why...?

Tsugumi had stared coldly down at Sara.

And Sara had desperately battled to stand her
ground...

What were the emotions that had welled up
within me in that instant...?

I felt like I was on the verge of figuring
it out.

Like my lost memory had been concealed by a
thick fog.

But then it was right in front of me, right there,
covered by a thin sheet.

But no matter how thin it was, I still couldn't
remove it.

The more I thought about it, the further away
into the fog my memory seemed to recede.

I wondered what I could have had in my past...


I continued to wander LeMU without
understanding anything...


2 :
Suddenly, I felt like I heard someone's
voice in a room, so I entered it.

In the sprawling night sky were a number of
orb-shaped planets...

And in between the planets, there floated a huge,
soft-looking whale.

It was the Cosmic Whale room.

Of course, the whale and the starry sky were
all merely theme park attractions.

I thought that wide open space and the
attractions would help to ease my ragged
nerves.

Even though it was fake, the expansive space
eased my tense mind and nerves, frazzled
from being cooped up for so long.

But I still had no memory...

I realized again just how stressed the
situation had made me without me even noticing.

For a while, I just relaxed, looking at
the scenery.

...


3 :
[Kid]
What...?

Something moved slightly on top of the whale.

I squinted, peering at it.

[Kid]
Sara...?

I glanced quickly at the planet next to the
whale and headed for the stairs leading to it.


4 :
I walked out to the edge of the whale's nose
and sat down next to Sara.

I thought that, normally, whales and dolphins
had their blowholes or nostrils near the
middle of their head, so it probably wasn't
accurate to say 'its nose'.

We looked at the countless stars sparkling
overhead.

It seemed as if we could reach the stars in
the sky.

If I had stood up, I could have probably
actually touched a star.

Because it was all a facade of fake stars
projected onto the ceiling.

Speaking of fake, the whale was too.

I didn't know what kind of cutting-edge
technology they used, but the skin on
the whale felt like it could have been real.

Then again, I didn't suppose I had ever
actually touched a real whale.

Maybe I was just working from some image
I had of what whale skin would feel like.


5 :

{1}{1}

Not having a memory was mysterious in a way.

Normal and abnormal, common sense and
nonsense... were all dictated by memory.

{16:4}

6 :
For example...

If a sea otter suddenly appeared right in
front of me...

And he said, 'I'm your father', then, well, I
probably wouldn't believe him.

Because in life, I had never met a cross
between a sea otter and a person...

{16:4}

7 :
But with no memory, there was no way for me to
know for sure if I had ever met a sea otter
person...

Thinking of it that way...

It was amazing to me that I could be so
logical.

{16:4}

8 :
I imagined that my memories were stored away
in a drawer in my brain somewhere.

And I was adding to the drawers even then.

However, the number of drawers that I could open
was limited.

I had no idea where the drawers from before
May 1st were packed away.

{16:4}

9 :
Still...

There was someone opening my drawers...

And he or she was judging whether what was
happening was normal or abnormal, common sense
or nonsense.

{16:4}

10 :
Rather, that entity was telling me.

I was a safe without a key.


11 :
The treasure in the safe didn't belong to me...

{16:4}

12 :
Incidentally, it wasn't just the texture of
the whale's skin that made it seem so lifelike.

The whale was alive.

At least it seemed that way to me.

A whale swimming in the starry sky.

Its back surging like a wave, it undulated
again and again.

Its soft mouth opened, closed, and even
puffed up from time to time.

About every three minutes, it blew out a warm
breath through its blowhole.

A seawater mist of spray would scatter around
the area.

Sitting at the tip of its nose, Sara and I
bobbed up and down in time with its
movements...

However, the whale undulated so slowly that we
could let go with our hands and feel safe.


It was like a cradle rocking back and forth...

On the back of the whale, we sailed through
the cosmos.

We were on our way to Planet Kuikui.

Sara slowly took something out of her pocket
and showed it to me.

It was an old-fashioned oil lighter.


13 :
She lit it.

The flickering flame made Sara's face look red.

I wondered why she was carrying around a
lighter.

I couldn't picture her as the type that
would smoke.

I thought I might ask her.

But as I did, Sara opened her other hand.

In it was the pendant from before.

A thin chain was wrapped around her index
finger. The pendant swayed in her hand.

Sara brought the flame closer to the pendant
and stared at it dreamily.

Her expression relaxed.

It was as if Sara was mesmerized by something.


A mirror was embedded in the pendant.

The flame of the lighter reflected brightly
in the mirror.

I wondered if...

Sara was staring at her reflection and
admiring herself.

I laughed without thinking.


{S4A000}
[Sara]
Huh? Is something funny?

[Kid]
I mean...

[Kid]
"It looks like you're sitting there grinning 
at yourself."


{S4A001}
[Sara]
N-no I'm not!

[Kid]
"I guess you've got a bit of a narcissistic 
side?"


{S4A002}
[Sara]
I said I'm not!

With that, Sara snapped the lighter shut.


14 :
That moment, I noticed something odd.

It had looked like the flame of the lighter
in the mirror split into two images.

I thought that maybe there was a crack in the
mirror.

[Kid]
Hey, can I see that pendant for a second?


15 :

{S4A003}
[Sara]
Sure...


16 :

{S4A004}
[Sara]
Don't drop it.

The whale's body continued to move up and down.

I figured that was what Sara meant.

[Kid]
I won't.


17 :
Saying that, I took the pendant from Sara.


18 :
I wrapped the chain around my finger and
brought it close to my face.

As I had suspected, the mirror was cracked.

It wasn't just broken. A piece of it was
missing.

I touched the area that was missing.

I thought it had probably broken from the
shock of Tsugumi dropping it.

The missing fragment might still be lying
about in that room.

Feeling the sharp contours of where the
missing piece belonged made me sad.

I took my fingers from the mirror and held my
palm out toward Sara.

Without saying anything, Sara plunked the
lighter down on the palm of my hand.

‡LShick.

It sparked and lit.


19 :
[Kid]
Oh...

I had spoken without thinking.

A three-dimensional image appeared dimly
in the mirror.


20 :
[Kid]
So this is a hologram pendant?


21 :

{S4A005}
[Sara]
Huh?


22 :

{S4A006}
[Sara]
Y-yes, but...


23 :
The mirror showed a person.

It was basically a headshot.

From the shoulders on up, the head and facial
expression were extremely clear.

I imagined it was made using a holomachine.


24 :
Holomachines were machines that would burn a
hologram into pendants, keychains, or any
other object that a person wanted.

On LeMU, there were even a number of those
machines.

{16:4}

25 :
I remembered that much.

It was the same as before‡Lif there was
something to trigger my memory, I could recall
some things.

I thought that if I could remember those
kinds of things, why not...

But I shoved that thought aside and focused
again on the image in the pendant.

Since it was a hologram, it also had depth.

Changing the angle of the mirror changed the
angle of his face.

His... It was an image of a man.

A man I didn't know.

I suspected it was an image that was closed
away in one of those inaccessible drawers
of my memory.

I had no memory of the face.

[Kid]
Who is this?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Huh?

[Sara]
...

[Kid]
Is it your boyfriend?

[Sara]
.........

Sara remained quiet.

Her expression was frozen solid.

[Kid]
It's your boyfriend, isn't it?

I asked her again.

But there was not even a glimmer of hidden
romance on her face.

Any girl looking at her boyfriend's picture
would probably show a smile.

Especially stuck in the middle of the ocean...

[Kid]
Hey, he looks pretty cool.

I said it in a teasing way.

Actually, he was so good-looking that it was
enough to make you sick.

I thought she might chirp out, 'Oh, honey,
I hope you're well. I miss you.'

But there was one thing that bothered me...

His image was all in one color.

But there was kind of a retro trend going on,
and some people did go for the sepia or
monochrome holograms.

So it didn't really seem all that outlandish.


26 :
[Kid]
So? How long have you been dating?

I put out the lighter, set it on the pendant,
and held it out to Sara.


27 :
She didn't take them.

She was still frozen stiff. It looked like she
was forgetting to breathe.

[Kid]
Hey, Sara? Sara?

[Kid]
Hello! Sara!

I grasped the pendant that she hadn't taken
and shook Sara's shoulders.

Sara didn't even blink.

And then...


28 :
Fwooosh!

The whale exhaled.


29 :

{S4A007}
[Sara]
Kyaaa!


30 :
Sara leaped up and smashed into me, leveling
me with a powerful tackle.

It might have been that she was so surprised
she just wanted something to grab onto.


Still, her full weight came barreling into me.


With that, I went down, and she crumpled with
me. We slid down and off the whale's smooth
skin.

The stars appeared to gain distance.


31 :
What they said about space being weightless,
well, that seemed to be a lie.


32 :
Before I had time to think anything else,
my body made contact with the hard floor.

A fine mist descended onto my skyward face.


Sara was on top of me, unmoving.

I could hear her breathing near my ear.


{S4A008}
[Sara]
Safe landing, huh?

Sara continued talking as she lifted up her
face and peered into my own.


33 :

{S4A009}
[Sara]
Welcome to Planet Kuikui~


34 :
I ended up failing to give the pendant back.

I thought I would look for the missing piece
of the hologram and had an idea of where
it might be.


35 :
It was the site of Tsugumi and Sara's fight
the day before.

The fragment should have been around that
room somewhere.

I wanted to find the piece and put it back in
the pendant.

I thought if I could do it, Sara would jump
with joy.

As I imagined her happy face, I crawled around
on my knees, searching the room from corner to
corner.


36 :
[Kid]
Hmmm. That's strange.


{S4A010}
[???]
What's strange?


37 :
Surprised, I looked up, and there was Takeshi.


{S4A011}
[Takeshi]
You looking for something?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...

[Kid]
Actually...

I explained the situation and showed Takeshi
the broken pendant.


38 :

{S4A012}
[Takeshi]
"I see. Well, you're right about it being 
broken."

[Kid]
Yup.

[Kid]
If you don't mind, could you help me look?


39 :

{S4A013}
[Takeshi]
Ah, that sounds like a plan...


{S4A014}
[Takeshi]
But can I ask you something first?

[Kid]
What?


40 :

{S4A015}
[Takeshi]
"That image of the guy you were talking about, 
where is it?"

[Kid]
Where...?

[Kid]
It's right here.

I peered into the mirror.

[Kid]
Wh-what?

[Kid]
He's gone...


41 :
Takeshi looked at me skeptically.


[Kid]
But it was here yesterday... I swear...

[Kid]
Huh? I wonder why?


42 :

{S4A016}
[Takeshi]
It's no big deal.


{S4A017}
[Takeshi]
"I don't really care what kind of guy Sara 
would date anyway..."


43 :

{S4A018}
[Takeshi]
No... I take that back.


{S4A019}
[Takeshi]
I might be just a little bit interested.


{S4A020}
[Takeshi]
"But I suppose it doesn't matter now that the 
pendant's broke."


44 :

{S4A021}
[Takeshi]
"And since the pendant is something that's 
important to Sara."


{S4A022}
[Takeshi]
I'll help you look for the broken piece.

[Kid]
Th-thanks.


45 :

{S4A023}
[Takeshi]
First to find it wins, Kid!

[Kid]
Huh?

Takeshi thumped my back and set about crawling
on the floor to search.


46 :

{S4A024}
[Takeshi]
And? How much is the reward for this, anyway?

[Kid]
Reward?


47 :

{S4A025}
[Takeshi]
How much am I gonna get if I find the piece?

[Kid]
What... Are you going to blackmail Sara?


48 :

{S4A026}
[Takeshi]
What're you talking about?


{S4A027}
[Takeshi]
You're gonna pay me, not Sara!

[Kid]
Wh-why?


49 :

{S4A028}
[Takeshi]
"Heeey, heeey, don't play innocent with me, 
champ."

[Kid]
...Wh-what?


50 :

{S4A029}
[Takeshi]
"You don't think I'd let you take all the 
credit, do you?"

Takeshi wriggled toward me like a snake.
He stopped in front of me.


{S4A030}
[Takeshi]
"If I find it, I'll bet you're planning to 
say you did."

[Kid]
I-I wouldn't...


51 :

{S4A031}
[Takeshi]
'Oh, Sara, milady?'


52 :

{S4A032}
[Takeshi]
'Oh, brave youth. What is it?'


53 :

{S4A033}
[Takeshi]
'This is yours, milady.'


54 :

{S4A034}
[Takeshi]
"'Well, if it isn't the pendant I lent you 
yesterday! Oh joy, it is fixed! Oh, happy 
day!'"


55 :

{S4A035}
[Takeshi]
"'Oh, how I did slave, searching the floor far 
and wide all of yesterday!'"


56 :

{S4A036}
[Takeshi]
"'And was it alone that you searched, brave 
youth?'"


57 :

{S4A037}
[Takeshi]
"'Do you jest? Of course I went on my quest 
for the missing piece alone!'"


58 :

{S4A038}
[Takeshi]
'Oh, wow! Brave youth, you are amazing!'


59 :

{S4A039}
[Takeshi]
...So I know exactly what you're planning.


60 :

{S4A040}
[Takeshi]
You're full of yourself!

[Kid]
"Whatever. Anyway, that wasn't a very good 
impersonation of me or Sara!"


{S4A041}
[Takeshi]
Don't be so picky about the details.


61 :

{S4A042}
[Takeshi]
I'm rootin' for you, okay, Kid?

[Kid]
I told you it isn't like that.


62 :

{S4A043}
[Takeshi]
I said it's okay!


{S4A044}
[Takeshi]
I like doing this kind of thing.

[Kid]
What do you mean by 'this'?


63 :

{S4A045}
[Takeshi]
"I mean... well, you know, being Cupid, a 
matchmaker."

[Kid]
Cupid doesn't ask for money.


64 :

{S4A046}
[Takeshi]
I suppose that's true.


65 :

{S4A047}
[Takeshi]
Then how about you help me in return later?

[Kid]
Help?


66 :

{S4A048}
[Takeshi]
It seems like the generator needs looking at.


{S4A049}
[Takeshi]
"No big deal, just some maintenance that's 
gotta be done."


67 :

{S4A050}
[Takeshi]
Sora's orders.

[Kid]
"In that case, I'd do it even if I didn't owe 
you anything."


68 :

{S4A051}
[Takeshi]
Oh, thanks!


69 :
In the end, we didn't find the missing piece...

Takeshi and I were just standing around
covered in dust.


70 :
The door opened, and Sara came in.


71 :

{S4A052}
[Sara]
Oh, there you are.


{S4A053}
[Sara]
"I think I forgot to get the pendant back 
from you."

[Kid]
Oh yeah...

All I could do was hand her back the fractured
pendant.


72 :
Only then, like Sara was seeing us for the
first time, did she notice that we were filthy.


{S4A054}
[Sara]
What are you guys doing here anyway?


73 :
I couldn't think of anything to say. Takeshi
and I exchanged glances.


74 :

{S4A055}
[Takeshi]
"Actually... we were looking for the missing 
piece."


75 :

{S4A056}
[Sara]
Piece? What's that?


76 :

{S4A057}
[Takeshi]
The piece that broke off that pendant.


{S4A058}
[Takeshi]
We thought we'd try to fix it for you.


77 :

{S4A059}
[Sara]
Oh, don't worry about that.

Sara looked kind of embarrassed.

What?

What had happened?

All of a sudden, Takeshi had made it look
like it was all his bright idea.

I thought he was going to let me take the
credit.


78 :

{S4A060}
[Sara]
"Besides... I'm pretty sure you're not going to 
find the piece here."

[Kid]
Why not?


79 :

{S4A061}
[Sara]
"Because... this pendant was cracked from the 
start."


80 :

{S4A062}
[Takeshi]
From the start?


81 :

{S4A063}
[Sara]
Yup.


{S4A064}
[Sara]
"I don't know why, but I've had this pendant 
as long as I can remember."


{S4A065}
[Sara]
And this piece broke off a long time ago.

[Kid]
Oh, well, that means...


82 :

{S4A066}
[Takeshi]
We didn't have a chance of finding it.


{S4A067}
[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...


83 :
Takeshi's sigh echoed throughout the infirmary.


84 :
After lunch... Takeshi gave me more information
about the generator problem.

He said that the part we had repaired before
was malfunctioning, and the machine wasn't
stable.

Takeshi told me when to meet him to fix it.
Then he said he had something to do and took
off.

I didn't have anything to do until our meeting
time, so I walked the corridors alone.


85 :
Suddenly, I noticed a faint voice.

It sounded like a song.

But I wondered who it could be.

I turned toward the direction of the voice.


86 :
No one was there...

And the voice had stopped.

But I was sure that the voice had come from
around here.

I thought that maybe...


87 :
I peeked into the compression chamber from the
shadows and saw Sara.

Sara was sitting in front of the thick window
and staring at her pendant.

I thought I might call out to her.

She seemed to be focusing on something...

It looked like she was starting to recite a
song.


88 :

{S4A068}
[Sara]
Moon sprite shouldering a long bow.

{S4A069}
[Sara]
Waiting inside a dream.

{S4A070}
[Sara]
Tonight, a story by moonlight.

{S4A071}
[Sara]
Hoping the wait will be short.

{S4A072}
[Sara]
Sleeping curled and snug.

{S4A073}
[Sara]
Sleeping in mother's arms.

89 :
She finished singing.


90 :
A tear streaked down Sara's face.


91 :
It didn't seem like a good time to call out
to her.

So I went to leave.


92 :
Then, in front of my eyes, another
scene fused together with the one I was
witnessing.

A girl was sitting on the bed, crying in the
same way.

She was stifling her sobs to keep others from
worrying...

But who? Who was she?

What could it all mean?

What was the matter with me?


{S4A074}
[Sara]
Who's there...?


93 :
With her voice, the image instantly vanished.

Still confused by what I had just seen,
I answered...

[Kid]
It's me, Sara.

[Kid]
"Sorry... I wanted to say something... but it 
just didn't seem right."


94 :
Sara wiped away her tears as if hiding them...


95 :

{S4A075}
[Sara]
What? What do you mean?

She seemed her upbeat self again.

I faced her and sat down.

[Kid]
That song, you sang it before.

[Kid]
In front of the generator room, I think.


96 :

{S4A076}
[Sara]
Hey, your memory IS fine.


97 :

{S4A077}
[Sara]
"Maybe you lost your memory because you packed 
your head with so many useless little things 
like that."

Sara laughed as she said that.

[Kid]
Is that song a lullaby or something?


98 :

{S4A078}
[Sara]
Yeah. You've never heard it?

I shook my head.

I didn't recall hearing it before.


{S4A079}
[Sara]
Really? You don't know it?

I pretended to think about it.

Even if I did think on it, I didn't imagine
I'd remember it.


99 :

{S4A080}
[Sara]
Oh, I see... That's right...

Sara said it sadly and glanced down at the
pendant hanging from the middle finger of
her left hand.

[Kid]
Uh...

[Kid]
There was something I wanted to ask you.


100 :

{S4A081}
[Sara]
?

I told her about how the image of the man in
the hologram pendant had disappeared.

[Kid]
I was sure the image was there yesterday...


101 :

{S4A082}
[Sara]
Oh, that's because we're indoors.

[Kid]
Huh? Whaddya mean?

[Kid]
"Yesterday when we looked at it, we were in 
LeMU."


{S4A083}
[Sara]
No, that's not inside.

[Kid]
?


102 :

{S4A084}
[Sara]
That's a part of space, right?

[Kid]
...


103 :

{S4A085}
[Sara]
I'm just kidding...


104 :

{S4A086}
[Sara]
Here's how it works...

With that, Sara took the lighter from her
pocket.

She put the lighter's flame close to the
pendant.

[Kid]
Oh.

The man in the hologram floated there,
the same as the day before.

The image wasn't as clear as before.

I thought that it was probably the bad light.

The room with the whale was mostly dark.
I figured that was why he wasn't as clear.


[Kid]
"So you have to hold the lighter flame next 
to it to see it?"

I asked her.


{S4A087}
[Sara]
Yup.


105 :

{S4A088}
[Sara]
It's gotta be either the lighter or sunlight.

[Kid]
Sunlight?


106 :

{S4A089}
[Sara]
"Yeah. I don't really know how it works, 
but you can't see it under fluorescent lights. 
Weird, huh?"


107 :
That was when I understood why Sara always
carried the lighter.

It was to look at the hologram...

Sara lit the flame.

Then she put it out again.

Lit it and put it out, lit it and put it out...

She stared absently at the image of the man
appearing and disappearing.


108 :

{S4A090}
[Sara]
Both of my parents are gone.

Sara said that out of the blue.


{S4A091}
[Sara]
They died when I was little.


{S4A092}
[Sara]
"My mom and dad weren't around when I was a 
kid."


{S4A093}
[Sara]
"For a while, I thought it was that way for 
everybody..."

[Kid]
Really...

I didn't know how to answer.


I couldn't think of a decent reply.


109 :

{S4A094}
[Sara]
This pendant is the only keepsake I have.

[Kid]
So that man is...


{S4A095}
[Sara]
I think it's probably my father.


{S4A096}
[Sara]
"I don't know for sure, but that's what 
I think."

After a long silence, I said...

[Kid]
It's the same for me.


110 :

{S4A097}
[Sara]
Huh?

[Kid]
I've forgotten everything.

[Kid]
"So I don't remember anything about my mom 
or dad."

[Kid]
"If I bumped into them on the street, I would 
never know it."

[Kid]
Even if I get out of here in one piece...

[Kid]
I don't have anywhere to call home.

[Kid]
So I'm in the same situation.

[Kid]
It's the same as not having any parents.


111 :
[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Well, I should get going.


112 :

{S4A098}
[Sara]
?

[Kid]
I've got to go help Takeshi.

[Kid]
The generator needs some fixing...

I stood up.

As I was about to leave, I thought of
something.

[Kid]
"Hey, would you mind lending me that lighter 
and pendant again?"


113 :
[Kid]
Ouch. Takeshi, that hurts.


114 :

{S4A099}
[Takeshi]
You can take that. You're a man, after all.

Takeshi grinned sadistically as he patted my
right arm, which was supported by a cast.

The cast was made of a specially formulated
plastic. It was lighter than I had expected
and not too cumbersome.

Takeshi had put the cast on me with
instructions from Sora.

Sora said she had something else to do and
left the work to Takeshi.


115 :

{S4A100}
[Takeshi]
"Wow. That dive you took was really something 
else. Pretty impressive stuff."

[Kid]
"Be quiet! I told you my leg slipped. You're 
the one that forced the tools on me."


116 :

{S4A101}
[Takeshi]
"Don't try to pin this on me. I never said to 
bring the tools along."

[Kid]
"You're the one that sprang off without 
anything."


117 :

{S4A102}
[Takeshi]
"If we have to make repairs again, then 
we'll need the tools. So I left them there."

Takeshi was making excuses.

[Kid]
Okay, fine. It was all my stupid fault...

I looked at the cast wrapped around my right
arm.

While we were repairing the generator, I had
lost my balance holding the heavy toolbox and
fallen off the machine.


118 :

{S4A103}
[Takeshi]
"Well, don't get down about it. Sora said it's 
a clean break, so you'll be back in business 
in no time."

[Kid]
Easy for you to say...


119 :

{S4A104}
[Takeshi]
Alright, now it's time...

Takeshi picked up an object that could
easily be mistaken for a gun at a glance. It
was a syringe used to inject a cartridge
filled with a cocktail of antibiotics, fever
medicine, painkillers, and vitamins.


120 :

{S4A105}
[Takeshi]
Gimme your arm.

Takeshi put the needle against my left arm.

‡LPush!


121 :

{S4A106}
[Takeshi]
Alright, that should do it.

[Kid]
Thanks, Takeshi.


{S4A107}
[Takeshi]
"The break might cause a fever. At least you've 
got some medicine in you."


122 :

{S4A108}
[Takeshi]
"Either way, the medicine ought to make you 
drowsy. So take it easy."

[Kid]
Alright...


123 :

{S4A109}
[Takeshi]
Well, I should get going.

[Kid]
Uh, hold on a second.


124 :

{S4A110}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What is it?

[Kid]
There's something I want you to see.


{S4A111}
[Takeshi]
What?

[Kid]
This.

I held Sara's pendant out to Takeshi.


125 :

{S4A112}
[Takeshi]
Not that again.

[Kid]
Yeah. I want you to look at it again.


{S4A113}
[Takeshi]
You can be a pain, you know?

Even so, Takeshi took the pendant as he said
that.

That time, I thought he'd be able to see it as
well.

I was going to tell him that it was a picture of
Sara's boyfriend.


126 :

{S4A114}
[Takeshi]
Hmmmm...

Takeshi scrutinized the pendant.

He turned it over, then sideways.

And then...


127 :

{S4A115}
[Takeshi]
There's nothing here to see...

[Kid]
Huh... There has to be... Oh!

[Kid]
I forgot.

I took the lighter out, lit it, and held it up
to the pendant.

I shined the light on the pendant.

[Kid]
How's that?


128 :

{S4A116}
[Takeshi]
Are you screwing with me?

[Kid]
Huh?


{S4A117}
[Takeshi]
Whaddya using a lighter to look at it for?

[Kid]
Because... that's how you see it.


129 :

{S4A118}
[Takeshi]
Huh?

[Kid]
Look hard! There should be a man's face there.


130 :
[Takeshi]
...

[Kid]
...


131 :

{S4A119}
[Takeshi]
Oh, you're right! There is.


{S4A120}
[Takeshi]
And he's not a bad-looking guy!

[Kid]
See! That's Sara's boyfriend.


{S4A121}
[Takeshi]
Hoho. Alright!


132 :

{S4A122}
[Takeshi]
I wonder when I started going out with Sara?


{S4A123}
[Takeshi]
"That, or is this some miracle mirror that 
shows the future?"

[Kid]
Huh? What're you talking about?


133 :

{S4A124}
[Takeshi]
The only face showing in this mirror is mine.


{S4A125}
[Takeshi]
That means I must be Sara's guy.

[Kid]
"Idiot! There's no way you and Sara would get 
together!"


134 :

{S4A126}
[Takeshi]
You said it, not me.


{S4A127}
[Takeshi]
"You said the guy in here was Sara's 
boyfriend, right?"

[Kid]
"I'm not talking about your ugly reflection! 
I'm talking about the holographic image!"


{S4A128}
[Takeshi]
"And I'm saying there isn't a hologram in 
here, stupid!"

[Kid]
Look again!


135 :

{S4A129}
[Takeshi]
"I AM looking! I am staring! Look at my eyes! 
They're WIDE open!"

I looked over Takeshi's shoulder and peered
into the pendant.

[Kid]
Look! It's right there!

I pointed at the hologram of the man.


136 :

{S4A130}
[Takeshi]
That's me, right?

[Kid]
"You're behind it! The guy inside the mirror 
is you!"

[Kid]
The guy floating in the front is who I mean!


137 :

{S4A131}
[Takeshi]
There's no floating guy anywhere...


{S4A132}
[Takeshi]
"How many times are you gonna make me say it? 
There's nothing there!"


138 :
Y¤u appeared as we were repeating that sad
exchange.


{S4A133}
[Y¤u]
"What are you all worked up about? You two 
finished fixing the generator?"


139 :
[Kid]
"Y¤u, come talk some sense into this idiot 
for me!"


{S4A134}
[Takeshi]
That's my line!


{S4A135}
[Y¤u]
What happened?

I showed Y¤u the hologram pendant.

And I used the lighter.


140 :

{S4A136}
[Takeshi]
"He says the face inside there is Sara's 
future man."

[Kid]
I didn't say that! You're twisting my words.


141 :

{S4A137}
[Y¤u]
Whoaaa. Is that so?


142 :

{S4A138}
[Y¤u]
"Cause either that girl is going to need a sex 
change operation..."


{S4A139}
[Y¤u]
Or I will...


143 :

{S4A140}
[Y¤u]
Yuck! Not for me~

[Kid]
Huh?


144 :

{S4A141}
[Y¤u]
I mean, this is just an ordinary mirror.


{S4A142}
[Y¤u]
"I don't think there's a hologram or anything 
in there."

[Kid]
"It's a hologram! There's a guy's face in 
there!"


145 :
I wondered how many times I would have to
shout out the same line...

[Kid]
Look! He's right here! Right here!

I looked over Y¤u's shoulder and pointed
to the pendant.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


146 :

{S4A143}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kid, are you alright? Are you having 
another fit?"

[Kid]
You really, truly can't see it?


{S4A144}
[Y¤u]
Really.


147 :

{S4A145}
[Takeshi]
That's right.

[Kid]
You can't see the man's face?


148 :
Y¤u and Takeshi looked at each other.

They couldn't see it...

Neither Y¤u nor Takeshi could...

I wondered why in the world not...?
