1 :
‡LThe conference room.

I was sitting in a chair, stuffing my mouth
with a 'tuna-wich-sand'.

I'd grown bored of the tuna sandwiches, so
I invented my own version, a slice of bread
between two pieces of meat.

It was definitely a needed change of pace.

Sara was sitting directly in front of me.


2 :
Sara was eating straight from a head of
lettuce with nothing but ketchup as a topping.

Muttering in a voice so small I could barely
hear it, she was saying 'I'm not getting enough
vegetables. I'm just not getting enough
vegetables.'

[Kid]
Say, where'd everybody else run off to?

With ketchup smeared around her lips, Sara
answered me.


3 :

{C3A171}
[Sara]
"Sora's in the control room. Nakkyu's in the 
security office."


{C3A172}
[Sara]
"As for Takeshi, I saw him riding the 
merry-go-round, goofing off by himself."


{C3A173}
[Sara]
And as for Tsugumi, missing as usual.


{C3A174}
[Sara]
"Now that the repairs on the warehouse are 
finished, I guess everybody's taking a 
breather."

[Kid]
Hmm...

[Kid]
So what do you have planned next, Sara?


{C3A175}
[Sara]
Nothing special, really.


{C3A176}
[Sara]
"Maybe I'll just sit here and wait to be 
rescued while I eat this lettuce."


4 :
Sara kept munching the lettuce, making a
crunching sound as she bit into the core.

[Kid]
"By the way, Sara, what were you doing up 
until now?"


5 :

{C3A177}
[Sara]
Watching over you, Kid.

[Kid]
Watching over me?


6 :

{C3A178}
[Sara]
"Last night, after we carried you to the 
infirmary, we all took turns watching you."


{C3A179}
[Sara]
"We were worried you might suddenly go on a 
rampage or something... so we took every 
precaution."


{C3A180}
[Sara]
"And until a minute ago, it was my turn to 
watch."


{C3A181}
[Sara]
"Except you up and disappeared the split second
I turned my back..."


{C3A182}
[Sara]
"I wondered what was going on and left the 
infirmary to find you when..."

[Kid]
When you found me crying?


7 :

{C3A183}
[Sara]
That's right.


8 :
Finishing off my sandwich, I reached over to
the lettuce in Sara's hands and ripped off a
leaf.

Using my index finger, I wiped off some excess
ketchup smeared around Sara's mouth, dabbed
it on my lettuce, and ate it.

[Kid]
What should I do next?

I muttered to myself.

[Kid]
Just sitting here's getting boring.


9 :
{11:0-db}
{11:1}Go see Y¤u in the security office

{11:1}Go to the warehouse with Sara


10 :
(Might as well go to the security office.)

I wasn't exactly sure why, but I somehow felt
visiting Y¤u would be the safest bet.

Sora was probably too hard at work in the
control room to be bothered. Tsugumi's
whereabouts were unknown. Takeshi was off
riding a dolphin.

But what about Sara...?


11 :

{C3A184}
[Sara]
Hey, what are you looking at?

[Kid]
Can I hang out with you for a while?


12 :

{C3A185}
[Sara]
Yeah, sure. No problem.


13 :

{C3A186}
[Sara]
"Might be good to show your face around here. 
Everyone's been worried about you, you know..."

Sara said that with her face still covered in
ketchup.

'Why was she using ketchup and not salad
dressing?'

The question nagged at me, but I didn't venture
to ask.


14 :
I wiped the ketchup off her cheeks with my
fingertips, and we left for the conference
room together.


15 :
As we climbed the stairs, I licked some
ketchup from my fingers.

It tasted of tomatoes. I supposed it only made
sense...

‡LIt made sense?

Since arriving at LeMU, I hadn't eaten a
tomato.

I wasn't sure I had ever tasted a tomato
before coming to LeMU.

Basically, I totally lacked all memory of
'eating tomatoes'.

But still, I had knowledge of 'what a tomato is
supposed to taste like', and that 'ketchup has
the flavor of tomatoes'.

According to Sora, I had evidently only lost
the memory of my personal past.

Retrograde amnesia...

Apparently, even if I didn't possess a memory
of eating tomatoes, I still possessed
knowledge of the connection between tomatoes
and ketchup.

What was more, it wasn't just tomatoes.


In every moment of life that I encountered and
that passed me by...

For every scene to reach my eyes or word to
reach my ears, I was able to distinguish
correctly between the reasonable and the
absurd.

For example, I knew that the sky was blue, the
clouds were white, and the leaves were green.


I knew all about man-made things as well, such
as electrical appliances...

Cars, trains, bicycles, roads, bridges,
skyscrapers, houses, furniture, toys, clothes,
food, movies, art, music, books... I knew
about them all.

People smiled when they were happy and cried
when they were sad. I possessed full knowledge
of the range of human emotions.


16 :
Furthermore, I knew that I was alive, and I
knew what it took to die.

I would die without oxygen. I would die
without food or water. I would die if exposed to
extreme heat or cold.

If I drank poison, it would kill me. If I
jumped from a high place, it would kill me. If
my heart stopped, it would kill me. My life... would
end.

If I lost a large quantity of blood, or if my
brain stopped functioning, or even if I was
lonely beyond despair... I would die.

I knew the boundaries between life and death.

Common sense and the absurd...

Somehow, unconsciously, I could judge between
what was 'true' and what was 'false'.

But how...?

I was probably able to objectively compare
things with my various life experiences and
episodes...

But if that was the case...

Then there was something that bothered me.

'Mirrors'...

I knew that when I looked in a mirror, the
image projected was myself.


But despite that knowledge, I had fallen into
a delirious state of confusion the night
before.

Why...?

When I saw the image, my immediate reaction
was, 'NO! This is wrong!'

In other words, my instant reaction was, 'This
isn't what I should look like! It can't be
right!'

Or to put it more simply...

When I tasted the ketchup, I could tell it was
made from tomatoes. It seemed like a natural
conclusion.

It was because the flavor matched my image of
'what tomatoes should taste like.'


The previous night's experience, however, was
entirely different.

When I saw my own face in the mirror, I
thought it was clearly a different person.

This was mainly because the face I saw did not
match my image of what I thought that my face
should look like.

Before I looked in the mirror, if there had
been no image in my mind of what my face
should have looked like, then surely I wouldn't
have fallen into such a state of shock.

Only when there was a basis for comparison
was it possible to tell whether something was
common sense. Otherwise, it was impossible
to know.

The only choice left to me would be to accept
the face I saw.

Sara's words to me...


17 :

{C3A161}
[Sara]
"I would think that you'd be relieved and think,
'You know, I've got a pretty nice-looking 
face.'"


18 :
I supposed that might be true.

But that was all the more reason for me to be
concerned.

Before looking into that mirror... I definitely
had held a certain image of what my face
should look like.

But my mental image and reality were different.

I began to wonder it was the image that was
false or just a mistaken memory.

In that case, I wondered how a false memory
could have crept into my mind...

[Kid]
Ah...!


19 :

{C3A187}
[Kid]
Who... are you?


{C3A188}
[Kid]
Who... am I?


20 :
I closed my eyes tightly and shook my head.


21 :
When I opened my eyes, no one was there.

In a wild panic, I ran up the remaining stairs
and burst onto Zweiter Stock.


22 :
'I know what my face should look like!'

But the apparition which had shown itself to
me looked entirely different...

For an instant, I could have sworn that I had
witnessed my own self.

(But it can't be.)

(That person isn't me.)

(But if he isn't me... who the hell is he?)

[Kid]
*Sigh*...

My head pounded with pain.

My overall mental state seemed solid enough,
but somehow, one part seemed stuck.

Exactly what was jammed, and how, I didn't
know.

But as soon as I tried to force through the
memories, the pain in my head became
blistering.

(Who is he?)

(Who am I?)

But no matter how hard I thought about it, I
didn't seem to make any progress.

So I...

...Decided not to think about it anymore.

I turned off the switch inside my brain and
headed for the security office.

I wondered if I could let it go so quickly because
I'd learned such a hard lesson of what happened
when I tried to hold on...

Or if I had just become indifferent by nature...


Whatever the reason, I was suddenly so calm
and collected that it even surprised myself.


23 :
I went into the security office.

Y¤u was sitting in her chair, drinking coffee.

[Kid]
What are you doing here all by yourself?

I asked as I sat down beside her.


{S3A295}
[Y¤u]
I'm looking into something.

[Kid]
Looking into something?


24 :

{S3A299}
[Y¤u]
"I told you before, right? About why I got 
this job at LeMU..."


{S3A300}
[Y¤u]
"I'm looking for clues about my father, who 
disappeared."


{S3A301}
[Y¤u]
"He went missing seventeen years ago, and I 
came hoping to find a hint as to why."

I thought maybe I'd heard her mention it
before.

[Kid]
"You said that the last place he was seen was 
in LeMU, right?"

[Kid]
Oh. Are you investigating that...?


{S3A302}
[Y¤u]
Yes...

Y¤u nodded and shifted the cup to her other
hand.


25 :

{S3A303}
[Y¤u]
Information about my father.

[Kid]
.........


{S3A304}
[Y¤u]
It was seventeen years ago...


{S3A305}
[Y¤u]
They say there was a big accident here.

[Kid]
Accident?


{S3A306}
[Y¤u]
I don't really know that much about it.


{S3A307}
[Y¤u]
"Even looking at old news clippings, I wasn't 
able to gather much information."

[Kid]
What do you mean?


{S3A308}
[Y¤u]
"The cause of the accident, specific damage, 
what happened afterward... All the coverage was 
vague..."


{S3A309}
[Y¤u]
"I figure that the media didn't really know 
the details about what happened either."


26 :

{S3A310}
[Y¤u]
"Somebody or something powerful clamped down 
on information."

[Kid]
Hmmm. That's interesting...


{S3A311}
[Y¤u]
"An accident seventeen years ago, shrouded in 
mystery."


{S3A312}
[Y¤u]
"And my father, who disappeared seventeen years 
ago."


{S3A313}
[Y¤u]
"He worked here until right before the 
accident."


{S3A314}
[Y¤u]
"I can guess some of what happened from 
what we already know..."

[Kid]
"You think that the accident had something to 
do with the disappearance of your father...?"


27 :

{S3A315}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


{S3A316}
[Y¤u]
"I thought that here... That in LeMMIH, there 
would be some trace... That's why I came."


28 :

{S3A317}
[Y¤u]
"But since I started working, I haven't had any 
time to look into it..."


29 :

{S3A318}
[Y¤u]
"I couldn't even get close to LeMMIH's 
database."


30 :

{S3A319}
[Y¤u]
I guess it makes sense. I was pretty naïve.

The chair squeaked as Y¤u slumped back in it.

She just stared at the ceiling.


31 :

{S3A320}
[Y¤u]
"But... But... you know what? Opportunity 
knocked."

[Kid]
Opportunity...

[Kid]
You... You don't mean this accident?


{S3A321}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{S3A322}
[Y¤u]
Now I have access to LeMMIH.


{S3A323}
[Y¤u]
"Thanks to the accident, I've been able to 
get a step closer to my goal."

[Kid]
.........


32 :

{S3A324}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I suppose it has also put my life in 
danger, but..."

Y¤u joked, shrugging her shoulders.

[Kid]
So did you find anything out?


33 :

{S3A333}
[Y¤u]
That... That's the problem.


34 :
Tap, tap, tap...

Saying that, Y¤u started tapping on the
keyboard.

One of the monitors on the wall shifted from
footage of an observation camera to an image
of a computer desktop.

In the upper left corner of the screen, two
dolphin icons were displayed, showing that the
OS had begun to operate.

In the middle of it, one window was open.

Y¤u explained as she stared at the screen.



{S3A334}
[Y¤u]
"This is the authorization screen to connect 
to the network."


{S3A335}
[Y¤u]
"This is where the system assesses the user 
for proper authorization."


{S3A336}
[Y¤u]
"I'm attempting to connect to LeMMIH's C 
level... meaning I'm trying to access 
classified information."


{S3A337}
[Y¤u]
"But if anyone could easily access important 
data, it would be a security disaster, right?"

[Kid]
Probably.


{S3A338}
[Y¤u]
"That's why there's a screen where the 
computer asks, 'Hey, who's trying to look at 
this?'"

As she spoke, Y¤u used the mouse to
click on the box for 'Name'.

Inside the box were written the words 'YUKIE
TANAKA'.


{S3A339}
[Y¤u]
"Of course, there's no way I could access the 
system using my name, so I'm using someone 
else's name to get me in."


{S3A340}
[Y¤u]
But anyone might think to try that, right?

[Kid]
I suppose so.


{S3A341}
[Y¤u]
"Obviously, the people who programmed this 
aren't stupid. So, to prevent false 
authorization, they have methods 
to check people's identities."


{S3A342}
[Y¤u]
"The screen then says, 'If you really are Tanaka 
Yukie, please show me your password.'"


35 :
‡LPassword?

For some reason, hearing that term gave me a
strange tingling sensation in my chest...


36 :
Click, click, click...

Without saying anything more, Y¤u silently
typed on the keyboard.

From her fingertips, a password was entered
into the input field.


37 :
Tap, tap, tap...

'*

*

*

*

*

*

*

*'

38 :
Tap!

Y¤u finished her input and hit the Enter key.



39 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

Y¤u immediately tapped in another line of
letters.


40 :
Tap, tap, tap...

'*

*

*

*

*

*

*

*'

41 :
Tap!


42 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'


43 :
Tap, tap, tap...

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u?

I asked, watching her fingers dance
across the keyboard.


{S3A347}
[Y¤u]
Yes?

[Kid]
It may be a silly thing to ask, but...

[Kid]
"The thing that you're hung up on is the 
password, right?"


{S3A409}
[Y¤u]
Right...

And then, to my surprise‡Lsuddenly, words
started flying out of my mouth!

[Kid]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me."

Even as I heard the words come out, I doubted
my own ears.

Physically, there were certain spasmodic
actions such as coughing, sneezing, or
throwing up that were simply beyond human
ability to control.

As I uttered those words, that was exactly how
I felt.

Before I could even think, I was driven by the
impulse to blurt the words out.

[Y¤u]
..................

Y¤u stopped typing, even her breathing coming to
a halt as she froze in place.

Desipite noticing Y¤u's condition in the corner of
my eye, I continued to spasmodically speak.


I reached up and grabbed a piece of scrap
paper lying on top of the console.


44 :
[Kid]
Look! It's written right here...

[Kid]
"'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'..."

[Kid]
"I bet this is the password you're looking 
for."


{S3A470}
[Y¤u]
What!? Let me see that!


45 :
Y¤u bounced up from the chair and grabbed the
slip of paper from my hand.

[Kid]
"Lay the paper down and take a look at it from 
an angle."

[Kid]
You should be able to see it.

Although the words were bursting out of my
mouth against my will...

Y¤u seemed to be unaware of my state.
She simply did as I suggested and gazed at the
paper from an angle.


46 :

{S3A471}
[Y¤u]
Y-you're right!


{S3A472}
[Y¤u]
Amazing...! Really amazing, Kid!

Y¤u grabbed my hand and shook it happily.

...But she didn't stop there. She pulled me
close in a big bear hug.

Squeeze...!

My face was pressed hard against her bust.

It was a nice fit... A little too nice... I struggled for
air.

[Kid]
I... give up... Have... mercy...

I almost felt dangerously excited by her softness.



{S3A473}
[Y¤u]
We did it! Yeah, yeah, yeah~


47 :
Finally, Y¤u let me go.

She jumped around gleefully like a rabbit.

(I was glad she was happy... even if she did
almost crush me.)

Watching Y¤u all happy like that seemed to
wash away all my irritation and fatigue.

The stress I was feeling simply faded away.


48 :

{S3A474}
[Y¤u]
"I get it now. You can't see it from right 
above it."


{S3A475}
[Y¤u]
But if you look from the side... I see it now.


{S3A481}
[Y¤u]
"'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'."


49 :

{S3A482}
[Y¤u]
Alright! Let's try this for a password.


50 :
A recharged Y¤u faced the screen triumphantly.


51 :
But...


52 :
Tap, tap, tap...


{S3A483}
[Y¤u]
"'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.{1}
Okay then!"


53 :
Tap!


54 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

But she still couldn't get into the C Level
information.

And then, suddenly‡L


55 :
Beeeeeeeep!


56 :

{S3A494}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what in the...?

The screen went black.

[Kid]
What?


57 :

{S3A495}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know, but it looks like it 
automatically shut down the authorization 
screen..."


58 :
After a moment, the screen returned to normal.

Y¤u pecked away at the keyboard and called up
the authorization screen again.


59 :
Tap, tap, tap...


60 :
Tap!


61 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Cannot log in with the given
name at this time.'

{S3A496}
[Y¤u]
What!? What is this!?


62 :
She tried it again.


63 :
Beeeeeeeep!

The result was the same.

[Kid]
What does this mean?


64 :

{S3A497}
[Y¤u]
"Maybe I entered the wrong password too many 
times and it activated some kind of 
protection."


{S3A498}
[Y¤u]
"In other words, LeMMIH has completely denied 
access to my mom's name."

[Kid]
So...


65 :

{S3A499}
[Y¤u]
"So we'll have to give up for the time being, 
I guess."

[Kid]
...


66 :
Even so...

How could I have possibly known her mother's
password?

But at the time, possibly due to her intense
excitement, that suspicion never crossed my
mind.

The strange feeling of knowing what I
shouldn't have been able to know...

In the first place, I didn't even know what
that haiku meant...

I wondered what was hidden in the seventeen
syllables of it.

There was no answer or end to my questions.


67 :
(Well, I guess I'll take Sara to visit the
warehouse.)

Had there really been an accident which had
flooded the warehouse? I wanted to see for
myself.

[Kid]
Sara?


68 :

{C3A189}
[Sara]
Yeah?

[Kid]
Think you could join me for a bit...?


{C3A190}
[Sara]
Okay, but...


69 :

{C3A191}
[Sara]
"Do you mind waiting until I'm through with my 
lettuce?"

Sara said that with her face still covered in
ketchup.

[Kid]
Sure.


70 :
I decided to wait for Sara to finish her
meal.

While waiting, I asked her a question.

[Kid]
So tell me... why ketchup and not dressing?

Her answer was straightforward.


71 :

{C3A192}
[Sara]
Because I like tomatoes.


{C3A193}
[Sara]
They taste like the sun, don't you think?


72 :
Inside the warehouse, the air was filled
with a sticky humid smell.

And the floor was covered with enough water to
just cover our shoes...

Around the room lay pipes, many of which looked
to have been recently welded to repair damage.

[Kid]
"So there really was some kind of flooding 
here..."


73 :

{C3A194}
[Sara]
"Huh? Didn't you believe me when I told 
you...?"

[Kid]
Of course I believed you, but...

[Kid]
"There's a difference between hearing 
something and seeing it for yourself. I mean...
there's way more impact."


{C3A195}
[Sara]
Impact?

[Kid]
"You know, the impact from realizing I saw 
all this in a dream."


{C3A196}
[Sara]
Like a premonition...

[Kid]
"Well, I don't know if I could really call it 
a premonition or not, but..."


{C3A197}
[Sara]
?

[Kid]
I mean, Tsugumi didn't get hurt, right?


{C3A198}
[Sara]
Yeah.

[Kid]
And besides...


74 :
I said that and stopped, sweeping my eyes
across the room.

The scene was almost exactly as I had dreamed
it, but... one thing was different.

There had been a pile of scrap material
stacked high, but it was stacked on the floor.


[Kid]
"In my dream, the warehouse was completely 
submerged in water."

[Kid]
"But by the looks of it here, everything seems 
fine..."

[Kid]
"I wonder if you could still call that a 
premonition?"


75 :

{C3A199}
[Sara]
"Beats me... I have no idea about things like 
that..."

[Kid]
Hey, Sara?

[Kid]
"Was the warehouse arranged like this from the 
start?"


76 :

{C3A200}
[Sara]
Huh?

[Kid]
"See those containers and metal pipes lined up 
over there?"

I asked her while pointing to the rows of
scrap metal.

[Kid]
"Were those stacked up in one tall pile 
before?"


77 :

{C3A201}
[Sara]
Uuumm..


78 :

{C3A202}
[Sara]
"You can't expect me to remember all the 
details."

[Kid]
Yeah... I guess you're right...


79 :
Except for that one point, nothing else seemed
out of place.

However, I was amazed at how calm I felt
while analyzing the situation.

Premonitions, the phantom girl, the mirror
affair, amnesia... Considering the countless
number of strange things I had experienced, I
was surprisingly calm.

Not thinking of such strange events as strange
was, in itself... strange...

Was I just desensitized to everything?

Or maybe I just had never been the type to
think too deeply about things.

I didn't know why, but I felt fine about the
situation.


80 :
I walked a loop around the entire warehouse
and returned to where I started.

Only to find...


81 :
Sara was gone.

At that same moment, I heard a sound‡L'Bang!
Bang! Bang!'

Like something pounding powerfully against a
steel wall.

I searched for the origin of the sound.

A small door suddenly jumped into my field of
vision.

In front of the door stood Sara.

[Kid]
Sara!

I let out a yell and ran to her.


82 :
.........

......

...


83 :
[Kid]
What happened!?

I asked, standing at Sara's side.


84 :

{C3A203}
[Sara]
Nothing. What do you mean?

Sara acted like there was nothing out of the
ordinary.

In fact, she seemed so normal that 'normal'
didn't begin to describe it well enough.

The bashing sound continued unabated. It was
coming from beyond the door.

Someone was...

It sounded like someone was throwing their
body against the door.

And they weren't holding back.

It was an explosive force, almost animalistic in
intensity...

The sound reverberated to the core of my body,
rattling my brain.

[Kid]
Who... is it...?

[Kid]
Hey! Who's there!?

I yelled at the door.


85 :

{C3A204}
[Sara]
What...?

Confused, Sara reached out and touched the
door panel.


86 :
The door opened.


87 :
[Kid]
...Nobody's in here...

The room inside was dark.

But even before I could turn on the lights, I
could tell there was no one inside.

[Kid]
So then, what was that noise just now!?

I turned around and looked at Sara.


88 :

{C3A205}
[Sara]
"Hey, what is it THIS time? I have no idea what
you've been going on about."

[Kid]
What do you mean, no idea!?

[Kid]
I'm asking what that noise was just now!


{C3A206}
[Sara]
What noise?

[Kid]
A noise... You know... the noise!?

[Kid]
"The sound of someone ramming into the door. 
That noise."


89 :

{C3A207}
[Sara]
*Sigh*... I'm tired.

[Kid]
What?


{C3A208}
[Sara]
"No, really, I'm tired of putting up with this kind 
of thing."

Sara said that to me with a scornful look on
her face.

[Kid]
What are you talking about?


90 :

{C3A209}
[Sara]
"That's exactly what I want to ask you. What 
are you talking about?"

[Kid]
.........


{C3A210}
[Sara]
"First, you knew my name. Then, you predict the 
future..."


{C3A211}
[Sara]
And you see little girls who aren't there?


{C3A212}
[Sara]
"And when you look in the mirror, you think 
you're a different person?"


{C3A213}
[Sara]
"Now, you're hearing sounds that aren't 
there..."


{C3A214}
[Sara]
"I'm sorry, but I just can't keep putting up 
with this..."

[Kid]
Hearing sounds that aren't there...?

[Kid]
You mean you couldn't hear it, Sara?


{C3A215}
[Sara]
Uugh... I shouldn't have to answer, but...


{C3A216}
[Sara]
No, I didn't hear it.

[Kid]
"So why were you standing in front of that 
door?"


91 :

{C3A217}
[Sara]
Like I've been saying, no particular reason.


92 :

{C3A218}
[Sara]
I was just wondering what's beyond it, that's all.

[Kid]
Are you serious?


93 :

{C3A219}
[Sara]
Why would I lie about something like that?


94 :

{C3A220}
[Sara]
"If there was a place on a map you'd never 
been to, wouldn't you want to go there?"


{C3A221}
[Sara]
"If there was an unopened treasure box, 
wouldn't you want to open it?"


{C3A222}
[Sara]
"If there was a person in the town that you 
lived in who you'd never talked to before, 
wouldn't you want to say something to that 
person?"

[Kid]
Ah, I see...

Sara's discomfort showed clearly on her face.


Her eyes were frightened.

So I...


95 :
[Kid]
Really! I don't know what came over me!

[Kid]
Hahaha.

[Kid]
Hahahahahaha!


96 :
...I decided to try to play it off by laughing.

Not thinking of strange events as 'strange' was
becoming... not so strange after all.

When enough coincidences happened one after
the other, they stopped being coincidental and
started to become unavoidable.

What was more, having encountered strange
phenomena so often that they seemed like old
acquaintances, I started to think that nothing
could faze me.

What a time to suddenly become philosophical!

Spiritual awakening! Enlightenment! Nirvana!

I felt like there was nothing left to be
afraid of...

[Kid]
Haaaaaaahahahahaha!

My laughing voice reverberated throughout the
room.


97 :

{C3A223}
[Sara]
Ouch... That really hurts...

It seemed my laughing had only proved to
increase Sara's frustration and doubt in me,
but I didn't care.

And the look she gave me, like I was some kind
of weirdo, didn't bother me either.


98 :
I began to dance lightly, circling around the
small room like a Polynesian tribal dancer.


99 :
But it made me dizzy, so I stopped.

Out of breath, I leaned against the nearest
wall for support.

In front of me, I noticed a small square window.

From outside the window, faint moonlight shone
in.

(Huh...? Moonlight...?)

Sara must have noticed the direction of my gaze,
because she began to walk toward the window.

Speaking toward her backside, I said...

[Kid]
"Why would there be a window in a place like 
this?"


100 :

{C3A224}
[Sara]
...Huh?

Sara's feet stopped.


{C3A225}
[Sara]
This looks like... a window to you...?

She said as she spun around.

[Kid]
Isn't it... a window?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Because... the light...


{C3A226}
[Sara]
Light?


101 :
Sara shuffled backward and planted her back
against the wall.


102 :

{C3A227}
[Sara]
You just said 'light', didn't you?

[Kid]
Uh, yeah...


{C3A228}
[Sara]
It looks like it's shining light to you?

As if being called by the light, I began to
walk toward it.


103 :
I knocked a few times against the window with
my knuckles.

I stopped in front of the window.

Except... it wasn't a window at all.

It was... a steel door buried in the wall.


104 :

{C3A229}
[Sara]
Hey? Will you answer my question?


{C3A230}
[Sara]
Does it look like a light is shining?

[Kid]
Yeah, it does.


105 :
Sara stood beside me and put her hand on the
steel door.

I also reached out and placed the flat of my
hand on the door.

The door seemed to sizzle with a penetrating
heat.

Without changing our pose, our eyes met.


Sara started to speak but hesitated.

She then opened her lips to try again, but she
stammered.

Her breathing became rough.

She seemed a little agitated.

A red light seemed to emanate from her body.

[Kid]
So why does it look like it's shining?

It was a very innocent, almost naïve question.

Without answering me, Sara removed her hand
from the door.

I removed mine as well.

Two faint handprints were left imprinted on
the square steel door.


106 :

{C3A231}
[Sara]
Kid... Can you see this?

Muttering, Sara gently removed something from
her pocket.

‡LShick.


107 :
A flame appeared.

The whole scene changed in an instant as
Sara's face lit up in red.

I realized that what Sara had taken out was a
pendant and a lighter.

[Sara]
.........

Without saying a word, Sara brought the flame
and the pendant in front of my eyes.


108 :
Inside the pendant floated a holographic
image of a man who I had never seen before.

[Kid]
Who is this?

When I asked that, Sara's hand began to quiver.

The flame shook.

The large shadow that it projected on the
wall flickered as well.


{C3A232}
[Sara]
So...


{C3A233}
[Sara]
You can see it too...

‡LClick.

Sara shut the lighter.


109 :

{C3A234}
[Sara]
Kid, the other day...


{C3A235}
[Sara]
"When Nakkyu tried to open the door to the 
generator room... you stopped her, right?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


{C3A236}
[Sara]
How come? Why did you stop her?

[Kid]
Wait, hold on a second.

[Kid]
"Weren't you just telling me how tired you 
were of all my 'premonitions and illusions'?"


{C3A237}
[Sara]
Premonitions...?


{C3A238}
[Sara]
So that was... a premonition?

[Kid]
I can't say. I mean, I don't really know...

[Kid]
"It's just that I thought it would be 
dangerous for her to open the door..."


110 :
Sara looked at the ceiling.

Then she looked at the square door in the
wall, the pendant held tightly in her hand,
and finally, slightly upward into my eyes.


There was a long silence.

Sara looked deep in thought, or maybe as
though she wasn't thinking anything...

The only sound was her steady measured breaths.


Eventually...


{C3A239}
[Sara]
Yeah, it couldn't be, right?


{C3A240}
[Sara]
*Sigh*...


111 :
Sara took a deep breath and put away the
lighter and pendant.


112 :
We left the room.

Sara took a big stretch.

I repeated my question to her.

[Kid]
Sara? Whose image was that in the pendant?

As she walked toward the exit, she answered.


{C3A241}
[Sara]
A person from the sun.
