1 :
I decided to check Dritter Stock from end to
end.

Y¤u and Sara were probably investigating
upstairs.


2 :
‡LThe rest area.

I noticed immediately that the scenery was
different from the morning.

The pond in the middle was covered with a lid.

Or more a partition of sorts than a lid.

In either case, the pond was no longer
connected to the ocean.

The LeMMIH computer that Y¤u had talked about
might have automatically sealed it off.


3 :
‡LThe tuna sandwich stand.

There was still a slight scent of cooked
tuna in the air.

The second I smelled it, my stomach started to
growl.

I glanced around.

No one was there...

I thought I might eat...

But I didn't want to do anything criminal.


I swallowed once and left that area behind.


4 :
‡LThe conference room.

There was nothing really out of the ordinary
there, but I did pick up on one thing.

The room was not flooded with seawater.

The elevated entrance had stopped the water.


5 :
‡LThe tuna sandwich stand.

The fragrance of food was tickling my nose.


6 :
‡LThe control room.

That room was also spared flooding by its
elevated entrance.

The chair that Y¤u had knocked over was as
she had left it.

I put it back where it should be, checked
the room, and left.


7 :
‡LThe tuna sandwich stand.

The smell just wouldn't quit teasing me.


8 :
‡LThe Lemurian Ruins.

Y¤u had passed through there just a while
before.

Just to be sure, I peeked in the shadows
of the stone pillars and behind buildings,
but I couldn't find anything resembling a
pathway.


9 :
‡LThe tuna sandwich stand.

That smell... Ohh! I couldn't take it
any more.

I slyly extended my hand toward the case
holding the warm tuna sandwiches.

The situation called for extreme measures!

I kept telling myself that as I munched and
swallowed down the sandwich.


10 :
With that, I had finished checking
Dritter Stock.

It didn't look like there were any hidden
corridors to be found or anyone trapped there
besides the three of us.

I wondered how things were above.

Maybe it was just like Y¤u had said.
Maybe there was no more point in looking...

It was still before our meeting time,
but I went back to our rendezvous point
in front of the control room.


11 :
And when I got there...

There was a surprise waiting for me!


12 :

{S1B000}
[Man]
Hey!


{S1B001}
[Woman]
Hello.

[Kid]
Huh!?

[Kid]
Who... Who...

[Kid]
...Who are you?


13 :

{S1B002}
[Man]
What, you forgot us already?

What in the world?

I felt like I had met them before.

I was pretty sure of it, but...

[Kid]
Uh, um, your name is...?

I couldn't remember it.


14 :

{S1B003}
[Man]
"Nah, I don't think I've introduced myself 
yet."


{S1B004}
[Takeshi]
I'm Kuranari Takeshi. And this here is...

The guy named Takeshi pointed at the girl.


15 :

{S1B005}
[Sora]
I'm Akanegasaki Sora.

She gave a slight nod.

[Kid]
Takeshi and Sora...

I repeated the words.

They both nodded.

[Kid]
But what are you doing here?


16 :

{S1B006}
[Y¤u]
Yahoo~

[Kid]
Huh? What's going on here?


17 :

{S1B007}
[Y¤u]
You don't have to be so surprised, do you?


18 :

{S1B008}
[Y¤u]
"Just a bit ago, when I was walking around 
Zweiter Stock with Mayo... we bumped into 
these three..."

[Kid]
So you're stuck here too, huh?


19 :

{S1B009}
[Sora]
Y-yes...


{S1B010}
[Takeshi]
That's right.

[Kid]
"Huh? Wait a sec... 
Didn't you just say 'three people'?"


{S1B011}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


{S1B012}
[Y¤u]
See. Right over there.


20 :
I followed the direction of Y¤u's finger.


21 :
Someone was standing on the opposite end of
the wall along the corridor.

I could only make out half of the person's
back, but I saw long hair and black clothes,
and it left an impression.


22 :
[Kid]
Who's that...?


{S1B013}
[Sora]
You mean Komachi-san?


{S1B014}
[Takeshi]
Oh. Komachi Tsugumi, I think it was.

Tsugumi... So that was her name.
She wore all black.

It didn't sound familiar. But still...

[Kid]
I feel like I've met her somewhere before.


{S1B015}
[Sora]
Do you know her?

[Kid]
"No, it's not that. It's probably just my 
imagination..."

[Kid]
It's just somehow... something...


23 :

{S1B016}
[Takeshi]
"Something? Anyway, she's pretty tough to get 
along with."


{S1B017}
[Takeshi]
"I'm not sure why, but it seems like she 
doesn't like me very much."

[Kid]
Doesn't like you?


24 :
I could feel a slight animosity emanating from
Tsugumi's back.

She didn't have to say anything; there was a
definite atmosphere which made approaching her
difficult.

(Maybe I'll go talk to her...)


25 :
Just as that thought crossed my mind,
Tsugumi shot a glance in our direction.

She had piercing eyes... and an intimidating
gaze...

With her glare eating into me, I couldn't take
even one step forward.

There was no way I could talk with her.

(Wh-what that's all about...?)

(Why is she so angry...?)

(I haven't done anything to make her
hate me...)


26 :
Tsugumi's gaze returned to normal.

Cold beads of sweat appeared on my forehead.

[Kid]
Oh, that reminds me, where's Sara?

Having realized she wasn't around, I glanced
around the room.


27 :
Without my noticing it, Sara had come to stand
behind me at some point.

[Sara]
.........

28 :
{11:0-34}
{11:1}Worry

{11:1}Don't worry


29 :
[Kid]
Huh? What's wrong?

I couldn't help but notice a dark
look in her eyes.

There was nothing left of the 'ninja' attitude
that she had departed with.


30 :
[Kid]
Did something happen?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Sara?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Sara...?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Hey!


31 :

{S1B018}
[Sara]
Huh? Wh-what?

[Kid]
You alright?


32 :

{S1B019}
[Sara]
Sure. Fine. Great.


33 :

{S1B020}
[Sara]
Why do you ask?

[Kid]
Well... I mean, you look so depressed...


{S1B021}
[Sara]
No, it's not that at all.


34 :

{S1B022}
[Sara]
It's just...

[Kid]
Just?


{S1B023}
[Sara]
"We didn't find an exit... so I'm feeling kinda 
down..."

[Kid]
Is that really all that's bothering you?


35 :

{S1B024}
[Sara]
Yeah. That's all.

Sara's spirits seemed to lift a little.

Seeing her smile made me feel a bit relieved.


36 :
But her expression somehow didn't seem fine...

It was probably to be expected, though.

All kinds of things had happened, and
in the end we hadn't found an exit.

Mentally, we were pretty well done in.


37 :
I thought that I should probably leave her
alone for the time being.


38 :

{S1B025}
[Sora]
"Anyway, just standing around isn't going to 
get us anywhere..."


{S1B026}
[Sora]
"Let's see what the situation in LeMU is 
right now via the control room."

Sora said that and pointed to the control room
right across from us.


39 :
Encouraged by Sora, we all shuffled into
the room.


40 :

{S1B027}
[Y¤u]
So, Sora, do you understand this?


{S1B028}
[Sora]
Well, let's see...

Sora faced the monitor and held up both hands.

Instantly, the content of the screen began to
change, with a number of windows opening and
closing while the search for data was underway.

I stared dully at her rapidly moving hands.


It looked like Sora was fairly used to
handling the computer.

For one thing, there weren't any flying chairs
or heels stomping...

It was completely different from the way Y¤u
handled things a while ago...


41 :

{S1B029}
[Sora]
...I've learned something.

Sora said it in a businesslike manner. She
seemed done with the computer.

Everyone looked in her direction.


42 :

{S1B030}
[Sora]
"Everyone, please calm down and listen 
to me..."


{S1B031}
[Sora]
Please don't get hysterical or depressed.

As she said that, I noticed she looked a
little pale.

The room went quiet as the focus shifted to
her.

43 :

{S1B032}
[Sora]
"I have a report on the current status of 
LeMU."


44 :

{S1B033}
[Sora]
First, the first floor, Erster Boden...


{S1B034}
[Sora]
Is completely flooded.


{S1B035}
[Y¤u]
Co-completely!?


{S1B036}
[Sora]
"Yes. All of the partitions have dropped, 
and it isn't possible to get through 
any of its corridors."


{S1B037}
[Sara]
"So what you mean is... All the paths leading 
up are completely shut off?"


{S1B038}
[Sora]
That is correct.


{S1B039}
[Sora]
Furthermore...


45 :

{S1B040}
[Sora]
Here is the status of Zweiter Stock.


{S1B041}
[Sora]
"This is the floor above, the floor with the 
infirmary."


46 :

{S1B042}
[Sora]
This is Dritter Stock...


{S1B043}
[Sora]
The blinking area is our current location.


47 :
[Kid]
...


{S1B044}
[Takeshi]
You serious...?


{S1B045}
[Sara]
No... way...


{S1B046}
[Y¤u]
Almost half of LeMU is submerged!

Sora nodded somberly with a pained expression
on her face.


48 :

{S1B047}
[Sora]
"This floor's dry areas are divided into three 
sections."

[Kid]
Dry areas...?


{S1B048}
[Sora]
"The areas that have no flooding and that 
people are able to pass through."


{S1B049}
[Sora]
"The central area displayed on this map is 
where we currently are in Sector Eight."

[Kid]
"Huh? It looks like the map is divided into 
two areas... so where is the third?"


{S1B050}
[Sora]
"Actually, due to a flaw in the system, a 
detailed map cannot be displayed..."


{S1B051}
[Sora]
"Sector Four, above the corner of Sector Eight, 
looks fine."


{S1B052}
[Sora]
However...


{S1B053}
[Sara]
There's no way to get there?


{S1B054}
[Sora]
Correct. It is impossible.

[Kid]
Why?


{S1B055}
[Sora]
"Because all of the corridors connecting the 
sectors are submerged."


{S1B056}
[Sora]
"In terms of distance, it is roughly 
100 meters."


{S1B057}
[Sora]
"I don't think there is anyone among you that 
is capable of swimming 100 meters without 
breathing."


{S1B058}
[Sora]
Therefore, I say it is impossible.


{S1B059}
[Sora]
"Furthermore... even if someone did reach 
Sector Four, I don't think it would improve our 
situation at all."

[Kid]
?


{S1B060}
[Sora]
Sector Four is in the same predicament as here.


{S1B061}
[Sora]
"All of the emergency stairs leading up to the 
floating island have completely flooded."


{S1B062}
[Takeshi]
"So, even if we could make it there we'd be 
wasting our time?"


{S1B063}
[Sora]
That is correct.


49 :
Everyone went quiet.

For a while, we just stared at the LeMU map
that was floating in the darkness.

And then...


50 :

{S1B064}
[Y¤u]
Hey, I just thought of something...

Y¤u opened her mouth silently.


{S1B065}
[Y¤u]
"Isn't there something like a wastewater 
pump in LeMU?"


51 :

{S1B066}
[Sora]
Of course there is.


52 :

{S1B067}
[Sara]
"Well, why don't we use that to pump the flood 
water out of those areas...?"


53 :

{S1B068}
[Sora]
It appears to be... out of order.


54 :

{S1B069}
[Y¤u]
Why? We've got electricity...


{S1B070}
[Sora]
I am not yet certain... of the cause.


{S1B071}
[Sora]
"Some electrical systems, including the 
elevators, are not functioning."


{S1B072}
[Sora]
"Disconnected wiring in each sector might be 
affecting the situation, but..."


55 :
[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


56 :

{S1B073}
[Sora]
"By the way, a life readings search, or bio 
scan, for life inside of LeMU indicates that 
the people present are the only people 
remaining here."


57 :
The people there...

Y¤u, Sara, Sora, Tsugumi, Takeshi, and I...
a total of six people...


58 :

{S1B074}
[Sora]
"Furthermore, the current internal air 
pressure is one atmosphere."


{S1B075}
[Sora]
"The air is 22% oxygen, 75% 
nitrogen, and 3% helium. The 
temperature is 24 degrees Celsius..."


59 :

{S1B076}
[Sara]
"You mean the environment is suitable for us 
to stay here for a while?"


60 :

{S1B077}
[Sora]
I'm sorry, but that is the current situation...


61 :

{S1B078}
[Sora]
"Everyone, we will be forced to wait inside 
the complex for a while."


62 :

{S1B079}
[Takeshi]
For a while? How long is that?


63 :

{S1B080}
[Sora]
Until help comes.


{S1B081}
[Sora]
"I am continuously sending out a request 
for assistance. However..."


64 :

{S1B082}
[Sora]
"Right now, there is no guarantee that it will 
reach anyone."


65 :

{S1B083}
[Sora]
"All communication lines to Insel Null, 
including the emergency ones, have been 
physically severed and are unusable."


{S1B084}
[Sora]
"I have also been attempting to make contact 
via a seafloor cable network, using sonar..."


{S1B085}
[Sora]
"Right now, I cannot estimate when the 
network will be back online."


66 :

{S1B086}
[Takeshi]
"So we're like little kids lost smack in the 
middle of the ocean, and nobody can hear our 
SOS..."


67 :

{S1B087}
[Sora]
Exactly.


68 :
The gravity of the situation was
descending on us.

There was every reason for everyone to get
depressed.

Takeshi and Y¤u let loose with sighs almost
simultaneously.

Sara and I slumped our shoulders.


69 :
(That reminds me, what happened to Tsugumi?)

(She hasn't said anything at all...)

I looked back.


70 :
Tsugumi was standing in a corner of the room,
glaring at us.

Like before, there was an atmosphere around
her that seemed impenetrable.

(Really, why is she so peeved...?)


71 :
A little while later...


72 :

{S1B088}
[Y¤u]
"But, well... Getting depressed isn't going 
to solve anything, is it?"


{S1B089}
[Y¤u]
"Let's be positive. Positive is the word! 
Alright, everybody!?"

Y¤u broke the silence with her energetic
pep talk.

But no one responded.


73 :

{S1B090}
[Y¤u]
Now, quit looking so depressed.


{S1B091}
[Y¤u]
"Even if we're floating in the middle of the 
Pacific, it's not as if we're lost in a 
blizzard."

[Kid]
So what?


74 :

{S1B092}
[Y¤u]
"So I mean, if we wait a few hours, help will 
probably come."


75 :

{S1B093}
[Sara]
How do you know that?


76 :

{S1B094}
[Y¤u]
Well... Think about it.


{S1B095}
[Y¤u]
"We don't know why, but we've been trapped 
inside this cramped complex."


{S1B096}
[Y¤u]
"On top of that, we don't have any way to 
contact the outside."


77 :

{S1B097}
[Y¤u]
But, you know?


{S1B098}
[Y¤u]
"Even if we can't contact anyone, somebody 
else probably will."

[Kid]
Like who?


78 :
[Kid]
Ooooh, that's right.

[Kid]
"You mean like your colleagues... or Sara's 
classmates, or teachers..."


79 :
Y¤u gave a big nod as if to say
'That's right.'


80 :

{S1B100}
[Y¤u]
"And Kuranari, you weren't alone when you got 
here either, right?"


81 :

{S1B101}
[Takeshi]
Well, that's true.


{S1B102}
[Takeshi]
"The people on the floating island should have 
noticed a long time ago that we're still 
down here."


82 :

{S1B103}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{S1B104}
[Y¤u]
"So I don't know if it'll be a rescue 
team or a search team or what, but anyway, 
somebody should come to help us soon."


83 :

{S1B105}
[Y¤u]
So? Satisfied?


84 :
Sara, Sora, Takeshi, and I all nodded.

Hope returned to everybody's faces.

Only Tsugumi... Only she kept her cold gaze
trained on us.


85 :
We all moved to the conference room together.

There was something unnerving about waiting
for help in the dimly lit control room, and
there weren't that many chairs to start with.

I wondered if there was a place in one of
the dry areas where everyone could relax.

The closest one was the conference room we
were at.

[Kid]
"Hey... Sora, how come you know so much about 
LeMU?"

I asked Sora, who was sitting next to me.


86 :

{S1B106}
[Sora]
"Probably because I am a system engineer at 
LeMU's research and development division."


{S1B107}
[Sora]
Basically... the assistant chief.


87 :

{S1B108}
[Takeshi]
"Assistant chief... So you're pretty 
high up?"


88 :

{S1B109}
[Sora]
"Only in name. I'm really just an assistant. 
It's no big deal."


89 :

{S1B110}
[Takeshi]
"But hey, Sora, weren't you up at the gate 
above ground?"


{S1B111}
[Takeshi]
"You were giving some kind of explanation at 
the entrance, right? I only heard half of it, 
but..."


{S1B112}
[Sora]
That's right. So you noticed...


90 :

{S1B113}
[Sora]
"We are short of staff here. From time to 
time, I do that kind of work."

Sora smiled.

I wondered what the 'gate above ground' was.

I didn't understand what Takeshi and Sora were
talking about, but at least I knew the reason
why Sora knew so much about LeMU.


91 :

{S1B114}
[Takeshi]
"So that means... there are two employees from 
LeMU here then."


92 :

{S1B115}
[Y¤u]
Two?


{S1B116}
[Takeshi]
I mean Y¤u.


93 :

{S1B117}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I'm not really an employee. It's just a 
part-time thing..."


94 :

{S1B118}
[Y¤u]
And Kuranari? You just came for fun?


95 :

{S1B119}
[Takeshi]
"What other reason would someone have for 
coming to a theme park?"


{S1B120}
[Takeshi]
And Sara?


96 :

{S1B121}
[Sara]
I'm... Well, I'm here as a volunteer.


97 :

{S1B122}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Volunteer?


98 :

{S1B123}
[Y¤u]
It's an event for juniors at Kyumeikan.


99 :

{S1B124}
[Sara]
But it's basically just for fun.


100 :

{S1B125}
[Takeshi]
Hmmmph.

[Kid]
Huh?

Without thinking, I let out a cry.

For some reason, something bothered me.

[Kid]
"Everybody here... You're not all friends, 
right?"


101 :

{S1B126}
[Y¤u]
No way. We just met.

[Kid]
"So then why are you talking to 'Kuranari' like 
you're old friends?"

[Kid]
"And Takeshi is talking to you guys the 
same way."


102 :

{S1B127}
[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right, you don't know...

[Kid]
What?


103 :

{S1B128}
[Sora]
"When we all met up on Zweiter Stock, we 
introduced ourselves."

[Kid]
Oh, so that's it...


104 :

{S1B129}
[Takeshi]
Yup. That's it...

(Hm? Still, it seems strange how they're all
so friendly for having just met...)

That was what I thought.


{S1B130}
[Takeshi]
What about you? What's your name anyway?


105 :
[Kid]
...Huh?


{S1B131}
[Takeshi]
I'm pretty sure we haven't heard yet.

[Kid]
I'm...

[Kid]
I'm......


106 :
[Kid]
I'm.........


107 :

{S1B132}
[Sara]
An assassin, that's what he is.


108 :

{S1B133}
[Takeshi]
A...

{S1B134}
[Sora]
Assassin...!?


{S1B135}
[Sara]
He's being hunted by the underworld.

[Kid]
I'm not being h-h-hunted!


109 :

{S1B136}
[Y¤u]
"I told you to quit taking things so 
seriously. You just don't get it."


110 :

{S1B137}
[Takeshi]
?


{S1B138}
[Sora]
?


111 :

{S1B139}
[Y¤u]
Alright. I'll explain for him.


{S1B140}
[Y¤u]
Actually, he...


{S1B141}
[Y¤u]
He's got amnesia.


112 :

{S1B142}
[Sora]
Am...

113 :

{S1B143}
[Takeshi]
...Nesia?


114 :
Y¤u gave them a brief explanation of my
situation.

She told them how I'd forgotten my name,
address, family, and friends.

And that I only remembered the date and
everything after meeting Y¤u.

After listening to the explanation,
Sora said...


115 :

{S1B144}
[Sora]
"It sounds like it's probably complete 
amnesia, a type of retrograde block."


116 :
[Kid]
?


{S1B145}
[Sora]
"Complete amnesia. It's also called retrograde 
life amnesia..."


{S1B146}
[Sora]
"While general education and knowledge remain 
intact..."


{S1B147}
[Sora]
"One's name, background, family, and friends, 
all aspects of one's life history... are wiped 
completely from one's memory."


{S1B148}
[Sora]
"Normally, one's memory returns within a 
few days or months."


117 :

{S1B149}
[Sora]
"Hypnotism and electric shock therapy are also 
said to be effective means..."


118 :
[Kid]
E-electric shock...


119 :

{S1B150}
[Sora]
Hahaha. Relax.


120 :

{S1B151}
[Sora]
"To put it another way... This type of amnesia 
usually solves itself naturally."


121 :

{S1B152}
[Sora]
So for now...


{S1B153}
[Sora]
"You really shouldn't worry or think too much 
about it. That's really the best medicine 
for you."


122 :

{S1B154}
[Y¤u]
See? It's just like I said, right?


{S1B155}
[Y¤u]
Don't worry. Things'll be fine.

[Kid]
.........


123 :

{S1B156}
[Takeshi]
So there you have it.

[Kid]
You say it like it's somebody else's problem.


124 :

{S1B157}
[Takeshi]
That's not what I meant...


125 :

{S1B158}
[Takeshi]
"I mean, memory's a weird thing. Sometimes, 
when you're thinking about something entirely 
different, boom, you just remember."


{S1B159}
[Takeshi]
"Like with celebrities... You know their face, 
but you just can't remember their name..."

[Kid]
"Yeah... I wonder if that's just the way it 
works..."


126 :

{S1B160}
[Sara]
So how far back do you remember, anyway?

[Kid]
How far back?


{S1B161}
[Takeshi]
Yeah. You knew Sora's and my faces, right?


127 :

{S1B162}
[Y¤u]
And you remembered my name...

[Kid]
...How far... How far back?


128 :
I searched my memory for the earliest point I
could remember.

Was there a point where I could still remember
and a point where I had forgotten?

Different images floated through my mind as if
to provide an answer.

{1}

That was it. I'd lost my memory when I fell
into the pond at the rest area!

That had to be it.

{16:4}

129 :
I couldn't remember anything before that.


And I remembered everything after that.

So that tumble into the pond was the line
between my memory and non-memory.

{1}

My consciousness was cut off at that moment.

{16:4}

130 :
[Kid]
"I think it probably happened when I fell in 
the pond."

I announced that to everyone.


131 :

{S1B163}
[Sora]
"By 'pond', do you mean... the 'pond' at the 
rest area?"

[Kid]
I think so...


132 :

{S1B164}
[Sara]
You don't remember anything before that?


133 :

{S1B165}
[Takeshi]
No vague images or anything come to mind?


134 :

{S1B166}
[Sara]
Like the scenery around your house or...


135 :

{S1B167}
[Takeshi]
The girl you like...


136 :

{S1B168}
[Sara]
"On TV, you sometimes see dramas about 
people who don't remember anything but who 
instinctively know things."


137 :

{S1B169}
[Takeshi]
"I get it. Like the guy that paints like 
a pro the instant he takes up a brush?"


138 :

{S1B170}
[Sara]
Yeah. Like that.


{S1B171}
[Sara]
"So maybe you should try to see and touch 
lots of things?"


139 :

{S1B172}
[Takeshi]
Yeah... What should we have him do first?


140 :
The conversation about me went on around me...

My temples were throbbing.

My face was distorted with the pain.


141 :

{S1B173}
[Y¤u]
Wa-wait a second!


142 :

{S1B174}
[Sara]
?


143 :

{S1B175}
[Takeshi]
?


144 :

{S1B176}
[Y¤u]
Sora just said it, right?


{S1B177}
[Y¤u]
"'You really shouldn't worry or think too much 
about it.'"


{S1B178}
[Y¤u]
"If you put too much pressure on him, the 
mental stress will turn him into a wreck."


{S1B179}
[Sara]
A wreck?


{S1B180}
[Y¤u]
Like mental overload, maybe?


{S1B181}
[Y¤u]
"Sometimes he starts groaning like he's in 
pain... then he suddenly collapses."


145 :

{S1B182}
[Takeshi]
Is that right...?


146 :

{S1B183}
[Y¤u]
"So when it comes to things having to do with 
his memory, take it easy, or..."


147 :
Y¤u gently placed her hands on my head.


148 :
When she did, it was strange, but it seemed to
suck away the pain.


149 :

{S1B184}
[Takeshi]
Okay. Got it.


{S1B185}
[Takeshi]
Now let's talk about something else.


150 :

{S1B186}
[Sora]
Um...


{S1B187}
[Sora]
"Something has been bothering me for a 
while..."


{S1B188}
[Sara]
?


151 :

{S1B189}
[Takeshi]
?


152 :

{S1B190}
[Y¤u]
?


{S1B191}
[Sora]
What do you suppose we should call him?


{S1B192}
[Y¤u]
"Oh yeah. We should probably decide to 
call him something or else it'll kind 
of be a pain."


153 :

{S1B193}
[Takeshi]
How about John?


{S1B194}
[Takeshi]
It'd be fitting to call him John Doe.


154 :

{S1B195}
[Sora]
"But wouldn't calling him that just because it's fitting be 
rude to all of the people named John Doe?"


{S1B196}
[Takeshi]
"Well, it's only for a little while, 
so it doesn't have to be perfect."


155 :

{S1B197}
[Sara]
Let's call him Sniper.


156 :

{S1B198}
[Y¤u]
Why are you so hung up on that?


{S1B199}
[Y¤u]
He's not that kind of guy at all.


157 :

{S1B200}
[Sara]
Well, how about John Mitochondria?


158 :

{S1B201}
[Y¤u]
I don't get it.


159 :

{S1B202}
[Sora]
Let's see. Let me think of another one.


{S1B203}
[Sora]
How about Melos-san?


160 :

{S1B204}
[Takeshi]
What? What's Melos supposed to mean?


161 :

{S1B205}
[Y¤u]
Like, short for 'memory loss'?


{S1B206}
[Takeshi]
Nah, it's bad luck to name him that...


162 :

{S1B207}
[Sora]
Sorry. I didn't mean to be so direct...


163 :

{S1B208}
[Sara]
Nakkyu, don't you have any ideas?


164 :

{S1B209}
[Y¤u]
Well...


165 :

{S1B210}
[Y¤u]
How about Kid A?


166 :

{S1B211}
[Takeshi]
"That makes him sound like a convict or 
something."


167 :

{S1B212}
[Y¤u]
Then Kid B.


168 :

{S1B213}
[Takeshi]
What's the difference!?


169 :

{S1B214}
[Sara]
How about Astiane Kumegawa?


{S1B215}
[Sora]
How about Memories On?


170 :

{S1B216}
[Takeshi]
"Enough with this! Something simple is 
just fine."


171 :

{S1B217}
[Y¤u]
We could call him Kid Q.

[Kid]
.......


172 :

{S1B218}
[Takeshi]
Hey, you. Which one do you like?


173 :
[Kid]
All of them...

[Kid]
...Stink.


174 :

{S1B219}
[Sara]
"Don't be so picky! These are tough times for 
everybody!"

[Kid]
Well...

175 :
{11:0-36}
{11:1}Mikami Tomoya

{11:1}Ishihara Makoto

{11:1}Fukayama Naoto

{11:1}Hayasegawa Shiina

{11:1}Inamura Motoki

{11:1}Inami Ken

{11:1}Watarase Kyousuke

{11:1}Prince


176 :
[Kid]
'Tomoya' sounds good.


177 :

{S1B220}
[Everyone]
Tomoya!?


178 :
[Kid]
'Makoto' is good.


179 :

{S1B221}
[Everyone]
Makoto!?


180 :
[Kid]
'Naoto' has a nice ring to it.


181 :

{S1B222}
[Everyone]
Naoto!?


182 :
[Kid]
'Shiina' works.


183 :

{S1B223}
[Everyone]
Shiina!?


184 :
[Kid]
'Motoki' sounds nice.


185 :

{S1B224}
[Everyone]
Motoki!?


186 :
[Kid]
'Inaken' is good.


187 :

{S1B225}
[Everyone]
Inaken!?


188 :
[Kid]
I like 'Kyousuke'.


189 :

{S1B226}
[Everyone]
Kyousuke!?


190 :
[Kid]
I like 'Prince'.


191 :

{S1B227}
[Everyone]
Prince!?


192 :

{S1B228}
[Y¤u]
No way.


193 :

{S1B229}
[Sara]
Forget it.


194 :

{S1B230}
[Takeshi]
You gotta be kidding.


195 :

{S1B231}
[Sora]
I can't concur.


196 :

{S1B232}
[Everyone]
I mean, it doesn't suit you.

[Kid]
......


197 :

{S1B233}
[Takeshi]
"Oh, this is a pain. We'll just 
call him 'Kid'."


198 :
‡LJust then!


199 :
‡LCrash!


200 :

{S1B234}
[Tsugumi]
Enough!


201 :
Tsugumi pounded the table and stood up.


202 :

{S1B235}
[Tsugumi]
Just what are you trying to do!?


{S1B236}
[Tsugumi]
What are you all thinking?


203 :

{S1B237}
[Takeshi]
What... We're thinking of a name...


{S1B238}
[Tsugumi]
Stop goofing off!


204 :
The room went quiet...


205 :
We all looked at each other.


206 :

{S1B239}
[Y¤u]
Ye-yeah... She's right...

The first one to open her mouth was Y¤u.


{S1B240}
[Y¤u]
"We're not thinking about his feelings at 
all... We just got a little carried away..."


207 :

{S1B241}
[Tsugumi]
That's not what I mean!


208 :

{S1B242}
[Sora]
"Well, Komachi-san, what would you suggest that 
we call him?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Everyone]
.........


209 :

{S1B243}
[Sara]
See? It's tough to think of a name.


210 :

{S1B244}
[Tsugumi]
Fine... Do what you want.


211 :
Tsugumi said that in disgust and left the
room.


212 :

{S1B245}
[Takeshi]
What's up with her?


213 :

{S1B246}
[Y¤u]
Why is she so angry?


214 :

{S1B247}
[Sara]
"Takeshi... did you do something to make 
her mad at you?"


215 :

{S1B248}
[Takeshi]
I didn't!


216 :

{S1B249}
[Takeshi]
"I don't get it. She's been like that since we 
met..."


217 :

{S1B250}
[Sora]
"It appears that we should be a little bit 
careful about how we treat Komachi-san."


{S1B251}
[Sora]
"Let's just be patient. Once she sees that 
we don't have any ill will or hostile 
feelings, things will probably resolve 
themselves..."

I felt as if something was controlling me...


218 :
The next thing I knew, I found I was rushing
out of the room.


219 :
Down the corridor, Tsugumi was kicking water
as she walked.

I didn't know where she was heading.

I called out to her back.

[Kid]
Hey! Wait!

Tsugumi didn't stop. There was no sign that
she would look back.

[Kid]
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

When I finally caught up with her, I put
my hand on her shoulder.


220 :

{S1B252}
[Tsugumi]
Don't touch me...


221 :

{S1B253}
[Tsugumi]
Can you please not touch me...?

Tsugumi stopped walking and said it in a small
voice.

[Kid]
S-sorry...

Apologizing, I took my hand from her shoulder.


222 :

{S1B254}
[Tsugumi]
What? What do you want?

223 :
{11:0-3e}
{11:1}Why are you so angry?

{11:1}I haven't even introduced myself


224 :
[Kid]
I wondered... why you're so angry... and...

I jumped directly to the point.


225 :

{S1B255}
[Tsugumi]
Why? Haha. You're funny...


{S1B256}
[Tsugumi]
You don't know why I'm angry?

[Kid]
I don't.


226 :
[Kid]
I haven't even introduced myself...

Somehow, I couldn't look Tsugumi in the eye.


Just our eyes meeting sent my heart pounding.


227 :

{S1B257}
[Tsugumi]
There's no need.


{S1B258}
[Tsugumi]
I don't want to talk to you.

[Kid]
Why not...?

[Kid]
Did I do something to make you angry?


228 :

{S1B259}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...


229 :

{S1B260}
[Tsugumi]
"Listen. Cut it out. I've had enough of that. 
Just drop it..."

[Kid]
Of this?


{S1B261}
[Tsugumi]
Don't pretend like you don't know. Please...

[Kid]
I'm not pretending...


230 :

{S1B262}
[Tsugumi]
I see through you...


231 :

{S1B263}
[Tsugumi]
I know everything.


{S1B264}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't believe it. I never thought that 
you'd join up with those guys..."

[Kid]
Those guys? Join up?


{S1B265}
[Tsugumi]
You were just talking about amnesia, right?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...


232 :

{S1B266}
[Tsugumi]
So how do you know those guys?

[Kid]
We... explained all that just a bit ago...

[Kid]
I remember meeting Y¤u.

[Kid]
Weren't you listening?


233 :

{S1B267}
[Tsugumi]
Don't lie to me!

Suddenly, Tsugumi raised her voice.


234 :

{S1B268}
[Tsugumi]
That's stupid...


{S1B269}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, I'm not falling for it...


{S1B270}
[Tsugumi]
Don't you ever talk to me again... Got it?


235 :
With that, Tsugumi strolled away.

I couldn't find the words to stop her.
I stared after her shrinking back in silence.


236 :
When I returned to the conference room, there
was a three-dimensional image of LeMU in
the center of the table.

Y¤u, Sara, Sora, and Takeshi were looking at
it and discussing something intensely.

[Kid]
Hey. What are you talking about?


237 :

{S1B271}
[Y¤u]
Hey, welcome back, Kid.


{S1B272}
[Sara]
What happened to Tsugumi?

I shook my head.


238 :

{S1B273}
[Takeshi]
I told you. She's difficult, huh?

That time, I nodded.

Tsugumi was difficult for sure. I had no idea
what she was thinking.

There was no point in prying any more into
Tsugumi's situation.

I asked them again.

[Kid]
"So? What were you talking about? 
I mean just now."


239 :

{S1B274}
[Sora]
The cause of the current situation...


240 :

{S1B275}
[Y¤u]
And what steps we... should take from now.


241 :

{S1B276}
[Sara]
That's what we were discussing.

[Kid]
"Oh. The cause of the accident and steps to 
take, huh...?"

[Kid]
"Hey, do you mind filling me in on what you 
came up with? You can keep it simple."


242 :

{S1B277}
[Sora]
Sure.


{S1B278}
[Sora]
"Well then, allow me to explain about 
the accident one more time."

Saying that, Sora touched the holographic image
above the table.


243 :
Then she said...

'12:45 p.m.‡LLeMU was suddenly struck by
a blackout. The cause is unclear.'

'Immediately after that, an emergency
evacuation order was issued... The cause of
this was unclear as well.'

'In any case, the evacuation of LeMU by
visitors and employees was initiated at
this point.'

'12:54 p.m.‡LThe emergency doors
were activated.'


244 :
[Kid]
What does that mean?


245 :

{S1B279}
[Sora]
"That is referring to the emergency 
escape exits connected directly to 
the floating island."


{S1B280}
[Sora]
"These are located at the very upper part of 
the emergency stairs."


{S1B281}
[Sora]
"Normally, except under extreme circumstances, 
this door is not opened..."

[Kid]
But you're saying that it was opened?


246 :

{S1B282}
[Sora]
Yes...

[Kid]
"What exactly does 'except in extreme 
circumstances' mean?"


247 :

{S1B283}
[Sora]
I can't say for sure, but...

[Kid]
?


248 :

{S1B284}
[Sora]
In the manual, it is written that...


{S1B285}
[Sora]
"'In the case of an emergency, it is 
necessary to temporarily hold visitors 
in the decompression chamber.'"

[Kid]
"Why? But what if you have to escape in a 
hurry? Why do you have to stop in the 
decompression chamber?"


249 :

{S1B286}
[Sora]
In order to prevent decompression sickness.

[Kid]
Decompression sickness?


{S1B287}
[Sora]
"When there is a sudden decrease in pressure, 
the nitrogen that has dissolved in a person's 
blood turns to gas and can cause blood clots 
that interfere with circulation."

[Kid]
?


250 :

{S1B288}
[Sora]
"Uh... I'll explain that later... For now, let 
me continue on this topic, alright?"

[Kid]
Sure...

[Kid]
"Anyway, what you're saying is that these 
doors that shouldn't be opened were opened. 
Is that it?"


251 :

{S1B289}
[Sora]
That's correct.


252 :

{S1B290}
[Sora]
This is only my best educated guess, but...


253 :

{S1B291}
[Sora]
"It would appear that one of the visitors probably 
panicked and manually opened the emergency 
airtight doors in the confusion."


{S1B292}
[Sora]
"And then the door was not closed, but was 
left open."


{S1B293}
[Sora]
"Accordingly, the roughly six atmosphere mixture 
of gas inside was suddenly released outside 
the room."

Sora continued her explanation.


254 :
'2:39 p.m.‡LHelium, since it is lighter than
oxygen and nitrogen, was released first... and
internal pressure dropped to the equivalent of
the external pressure of one atmosphere.'

'3:55 p.m.‡LWater leak occurs.'


255 :

{S1B294}
[Sora]
"LeMU is a structure designed based upon 
saturation diving specifications..."

[Kid]
"Saturation diving specifications? What's that 
mean?"


{S1B295}
[Sora]
"To make the internal air pressure equal to 
or greater than the external water pressure in 
order to keep the unit from being 
crushed by seawater..."


{S1B296}
[Sora]
...That is what it means. Do you understand?

256 :
{11:0-40}
{11:1}I get it

{11:1}Not really


257 :
[Kid]
Yeah, I think I get it.


258 :

{S1B297}
[Sora]
Well then, why was there flooding...?

[Kid]
Yeah... That's right...

[Kid]
Couldn't it be that...

[Kid]
"LeMU was made to keep the internal air 
pressure and external water pressure the 
same so it won't be crushed, right?"

[Kid]
"But if the air inside completely escaped, 
and the air pressure dropped to one 
atmosphere..."

[Kid]
"Then wouldn't the pressure of the seawater 
push in, and..."

[Kid]
"Finally, there would be a tear somewhere and 
seawater would come rushing in..."


259 :

{S1B298}
[Sora]
You are almost correct.


260 :

{S1B299}
[Sora]
"Impressive, Kid-san. Are you sure you're 
suffering from amnesia?"

[Kid]
Huh? Y-yeah... Pretty sure...


261 :

{S1B300}
[Sora]
I have nothing left to add.


{S1B301}
[Sora]
"The sudden decrease in air pressure is the 
major cause of this flood mishap."


262 :
[Kid]
Hmmm.

I tilted my head.


263 :

{S1B302}
[Sora]
"Think about what would happen if you took a 
plastic bottle that was capped and filled with air, 
then put it deep in water."

[Kid]
"What would happen... The side of the bottle 
would dimple in, right?"


264 :

{S1B303}
[Sora]
Exactly.


{S1B304}
[Sora]
"This phenomenon is due to the air inside the 
bottle being pushed in by the water pressure."


265 :

{S1B305}
[Sora]
"So to keep the bottle from being compressed, 
what do you have to do?"

[Kid]
Oh, I see...


266 :

{S1B306}
[Sora]
The answer is simple.


{S1B307}
[Sora]
You pack more air into the bottle.


{S1B308}
[Sora]
"If the pressure from the outside and the 
pressure from the inside are in balance, 
then the bottle's shape will not change."


{S1B309}
[Sora]
"This is what is meant by saturation diving 
specifications. That's a little bit of a rough 
example..."

[Kid]
I think I get it...


267 :

{S1B310}
[Sora]
"By the way, in this bottle that we were 
talking about that is filled with air..."


{S1B311}
[Sora]
"...And immersed in water. What happens 
when you open a hole in the top?"

[Kid]
The air will leak.


{S1B312}
[Sora]
And then?

[Kid]
The air will escape out...

[Kid]
"Oh. And when the balance of pressure is lost, 
the bottle will be crushed."


268 :

{S1B313}
[Sora]
That's right.


269 :

{S1B314}
[Sora]
"And that is precisely what occurred and the 
primary cause of the flooding here at LeMU."


{S1B315}
[Sora]
"The drop in internal pressure to one 
atmosphere caused the glass to crack and let in
massive quantities of water."


270 :

{S1B316}
[Sora]
"Subsequently... in order to minimize damage, 
LeMMIH automatically closed the watertight 
doors."

[Kid]
And so we're all trapped in here...


271 :

{S1B317}
[Sora]
Yes...


272 :
Maybe it was because I had jumped into a
complicated discussion, but somewhere in
my head felt like it was tearing.

But thinking back on Sora's explanation, there
were two key points.

{1}

1. The reason for the complex blackout was
unclear.

2. The reason for the drop in air pressure
was that we had sprung a leak.

{16:4}

273 :

{S1B318}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Hold on a second.


274 :
Takeshi, who had been listening quietly until
then, spoke.


275 :

{S1B319}
[Takeshi]
So this here is one atmosphere of pressure?


276 :

{S1B320}
[Sora]
Yes, that's correct, why do you...?


{S1B321}
[Takeshi]
"So does that mean that this... voice 
alternator thing that we're wearing, 
we don't need it anymore?"


277 :

{S1B322}
[Sora]
No... That...


{S1B323}
[Sora]
Please... keep... wearing it.


278 :

{S1B324}
[Sara]
Why? The helium gas is mostly gone, right?

[Y¤u]
.........

Only Y¤u remained silent.

It looked like she was awkwardly avoiding
my gaze.


279 :

{S1B325}
[Sora]
A-anyway... Please just don't take them off.

[Kid]
Why not? What reason is there...?


280 :

{S1B326}
[Sora]
The reason... The reason is...


281 :

{S1B327}
[Y¤u]
"Well, if Sora says so, that should 
be good enough."


{S1B328}
[Y¤u]
"I'm still wearing it, and I don't have any 
problem with it... This voice alternator."


282 :

{S1B329}
[Sara]
"Well, that's for sure. I had almost forgotten 
I was wearing it..."


283 :

{S1B330}
[Y¤u]
See?


284 :

{S1B331}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, more importantly... We should be 
talking about... what we're going to do now 
as our next step... At least that's my opinion..."


285 :

{S1B332}
[Takeshi]
Next step, huh...?


286 :
After that...

We crossed our arms and started
brainstorming... but we couldn't come up with
even a single good idea.

In the end...


287 :

{S1B333}
[Y¤u]
"I guess all we can do is wait for help to 
come..."

Of course, there was no reason to expect
a differing opinion.


288 :
Nearly an hour had passed since Tsugumi had
left the room.

Sora had said that she was going to try
to 'think of a plan' and went back to the
control room.

The remaining four of us didn't have anything
to say or do and continued to wait for contact
or help from the outside.


{S1B334}
[Sara]
Tsugumi hasn't come back...

Sara muttered that.


{S1B335}
[Sara]
"I wonder if it's a good idea to leave her alone 
like this..."


289 :

{S1B336}
[Takeshi]
"I don't think there's anything good about 
it..."


290 :

{S1B337}
[Sara]
"Hey, Kid. You followed after Tsugumi a bit 
ago, right?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


{S1B338}
[Sara]
"She didn't say where she was going or 
anything?"

[Kid]
Nope, she didn't mention anything.


291 :

{S1B339}
[Y¤u]
Oh well...


{S1B340}
[Y¤u]
You want to look for her?

As if Y¤u's words were a sign, I stood up.


292 :
For some reason, Y¤u made straight for the
control room.

[Kid]
Huh? Why the control room?


293 :

{S1B341}
[Y¤u]
You don't remember?


294 :

{S1B342}
[Y¤u]
"When we gathered in the control room 
before, Sora said something, right?"


{S1B343}
[Y¤u]
"By searching for the life readings or bio 
signs of such and such..."

[Kid]
She said that?


295 :

{S1B344}
[Takeshi]
Yup, she for sure did say that.


{S1B345}
[Takeshi]
Weren't you listening?

[Kid]
I thought I was, but...


296 :

{S1B346}
[Y¤u]
So why don't we do a bio scan for life?


297 :

{S1B347}
[Y¤u]
"We'll probably know where Tsugumi is right 
away."

[Kid]
Hmmm.

Bio scan.

It seemed like one difficult word after
another was being thrown at me.

I wondered if it was part of amnesia.
There were so many words and phenomena and
systems and stuff there that I was at a loss.

[Kid]
*Sigh*...

Without thinking, I let out a sigh.


298 :
Incidentally, there was another thing that
I hadn't been able to understand.

Somewhere along the line, everyone had taken to
calling me 'Kid'.

That random decision-making process to find a
consensus on my name had ended up with me
being called 'Kid'.

Well, it was better than 'John Mitochondria'
anyway.

But still, it was all hard for me to understand.

[Kid]
*Sigh*...

I sighed again and followed everyone into
the control room, shaking my head.


299 :

{S1B348}
[Sora]
Hey? Is something wrong?

Sora tilted her head, looking at us
quizzically, as we shuffled into the room.


300 :

{S1B349}
[Sara]
"Well, we just didn't think we could leave 
Tsugumi alone like this..."


301 :

{S1B350}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. So we thought if we could get you to do 
another bio scan..."


302 :

{S1B351}
[Sora]
Oh, I see. So that's it.


303 :

{S1B352}
[Sora]
"You want me to investigate the location of 
Komachi-san, then?"


{S1B353}
[Sora]
Please wait a moment...


304 :
A map of LeMU was displayed on the monitor.

It enlarged and reduced in size, slid,
spun... The image switched and changed in a
dizzying way.

[Kid]
Hey, Sora?

[Kid]
"Will you really know where Tsugumi is just by 
running a bio search for her?"


305 :

{S1B354}
[Sora]
Yes.


{S1B355}
[Sora]
"Humans are homeothermic animals, meaning that 
they constantly maintain a temperature of 
around 36 degrees Celsius."


{S1B356}
[Sora]
"That body temperature can be detected using 
infrared radiation."


{S1B357}
[Sora]
"Via this technique, we can affirm the 
location and number of humans in the LeMU 
complex..."


306 :

{S1B358}
[Sora]
See, there it is.

There was an uncertain bit of light in Zweiter
Stock.


{S1B359}
[Sora]
There's no mistake. That's Komachi-san.

Below that, in a room in Dritter Stock, there
were also a number of light-emitting points
overlapping.

I figured that was probably the control room.


307 :
(...Huh? What is...?)

Just then, I noticed something strange.

In a corner of the monitor 'Life readings: 7'
was displayed in small letters.

[Kid]
U...um...?


308 :

{S1B360}
[Y¤u]
What is it?

[Kid]
"Isn't there something strange about this 
number?"

[Kid]
See...

I pointed to the corner of the monitor.


309 :
'Life readings: 7'


{S1B361}
[Y¤u]
Seven!?


{S1B362}
[Sara]
Seven!?


{S1B363}
[Takeshi]
Seven!?


{S1B364}
[Sora]
W-why...

There should have been a total of six people
trapped in LeMU... Y¤u, Sara, Sora, Tsugumi,
Takeshi, and me.

However, the main computer LeMMIH was indicating
that there were seven people.


{S1B365}
[Sora]
What... What in the world...?

And then...


310 :
'Life readings: 5'

{1}

311 :
'Life readings: 7'

{1}

312 :
'Life readings: 6'


313 :
5

314 :
7

315 :
6

316 :
5

317 :
7

318 :
6...


319 :
The numbers changed by the second.


320 :
And always the number 'six' plus or minus one.


{S1B366}
[Sora]
Why? Why is this happening...?

Flustered and out of character, Sora was
busily operating the console.


321 :
But... the numbers continued to fluctuate, and
there was no sign that they would stop.

I shifted my eyes to the points of light
on the map.


322 :
Even if the life reading numbers changed,
the points of light didn't increase or
decrease.


323 :

{S1B367}
[Sara]
If the number really is 'seven', then...

[Kid]
"That would mean that there's another person 
here that didn't get out in time!"


{S1B368}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah, assuming that seven is the right 
number..."


324 :

{S1B369}
[Takeshi]
Hold on, everybody...


{S1B370}
[Takeshi]
Calm down...


325 :
For a while, I watched the number switch.


Finally...


326 :
It stopped on the number 'six'.

'Life readings: 6'


327 :
[Kid]
H-huh...? It stopped on six.


{S1B371}
[Y¤u]
It's probably broken or something.


328 :

{S1B372}
[Sora]
No... No, it shouldn't be...


329 :

{S1B373}
[Takeshi]
"Anyway, it looks like it settled on six...
so that's probably the right number. Right?"


330 :

{S1B374}
[Sara]
Makes sense...


331 :

{S1B375}
[Sara]
"Thinking about it, it's hard to imagine 
anyone else is here..."

[Kid]
But...


332 :

{S1B376}
[Sara]
But what, Kid? We looked all over LeMU.


{S1B377}
[Sara]
And we didn't meet anyone.

[Kid]
That's true, but...


333 :

{S1B378}
[Takeshi]
"Well, either way, we can check by walking
around the complex, right?"

[Kid]
.........


334 :

{S1B379}
[Takeshi]
But first, we need to go secure Tsugumi!


335 :

{S1B380}
[Y¤u]
Secure? You mean save?


336 :

{S1B381}
[Takeshi]
Saving is removing an object from danger.


{S1B382}
[Takeshi]
Securing is removing danger itself.


337 :

{S1B383}
[Sara]
Is Tsugumi... really that dangerous?


338 :

{S1B384}
[Takeshi]
"Oh, that's right. I haven't told Sara, Y¤u, 
and you two all about that crazy girl, have I?"


339 :

{S1B385}
[Sara]
N-no.


{S1B386}
[Y¤u]
No...


340 :

{S1B387}
[Takeshi]
"Alright. It's time to think of a way of 
securing Tsugumi."


{S1B388}
[Takeshi]
Are you ready?


341 :
We climbed the emergency stairs, aiming for
the floor that Tsugumi was on.

Only Sora remained in the control room,
thinking of ways to escape, trying to
reestablish communications, rechecking
the complex, and trying to get other
systems that were down back online.
