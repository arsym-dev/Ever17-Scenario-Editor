1 :
After waiting for Tsugumi to compose
herself... they carried out the procedure.

Drawing blood from Tsugumi's arm, they
extracted the antibodies and gave shots to
Takeshi, Y¤u, and the young Kaburaki.

They weren't able to give £o¢o a shot
because she was still in the pod, undergoing
treatment.

{16:4}

2 :
And it would still be a while before she
could leave.

They made another dose of antibodies for when
£o¢o was ready and put it in the equipment
storage container on the desk.

{16:4}

3 :
...Almost an hour had passed since the shot...

The antibodies didn't seem to be having any
effect.

The three infected people were lying,
worn out, on their beds.

Tsugumi said something briefly to Takeshi
and went back to LeMU.

'I'm going to go get Chami and bring him
back'‡Lwere the words she left him with.

Takeshi nodded weakly and closed his eyes.

{16:4}

4 :
‡LSuddenly!

In his barely conscious state, a noise from
the speaker reached Takeshi's ears.


{T6T222}
[Mission Control]
Come in...


{T6T223}
[Mission Control]
IBF Three, please respond.


{T6T224}
[Mission Control]
"This is the emergency rescue team from the 
Maritime Defense Force."

Takeshi rushed over to the terminal.


5 :

{C6A293}
[Takeshi]
H-hello!


{C6A294}
[Takeshi]
This is the IBF infirmary... over!


6 :

{T6T226}
[Mission Control]
"IBF Three!? I repeat, this is the Maritime 
Defense Force emergency rescue team calling 
from the control center at Insel Null."


{T6T227}
[Mission Control]
Can you hear me?


7 :

{C6A295}
[Takeshi]
"Yeah! We can hear you! We hear you! Loud and 
clear!"

Voices spilled out from the other end of the
line.

'Hey, there are survivors down there!'

'I can't believe it!'

'That's amazing!'


{T6T228}
[Mission Control]
"We're sending a rescue team immediately. Can 
you access the pool in IBF Three?"


{C6A296}
[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah, it should be fine.


{T6T229}
[Mission Control]
"Do you know how many survivors there are and 
where they are located?"


{C6A297}
[Takeshi]
"In the examination room, there are five... no, 
six."


{T6T230}
[Mission Control]
Six. I copy.


{T6T231}
[Mission Control]
"A rescue team is headed there in a private 
sector salvage vessel. When it arrives, 
I want you to follow its directions and 
get out of there."


{C6A298}
[Takeshi]
How long 'til they get here?


{T6T232}
[Mission Control]
"They're going as fast as they can, but it'll 
take about an hour."


{T6T233}
[Mission Control]
However, if something goes wrong...


{T6T234}
[Mission Control]
"There should be a small deep-exploration 
submarine left in the research facility. I 
hate to make you do this, but I want you to 
escape to that area."


8 :

{C6A299}
[Takeshi]
"S-something goes wrong...? Wh-what do you 
mean...?"


{T6T235}
[Mission Control]
"LeMU's partition strength threshold is 
already being exceeded."


{T6T236}
[Mission Control]
"If one section implodes, there's the risk 
that another area could collapse and start 
sinking."


{T6T237}
[Mission Control]
"If that happens, we think there's a high 
possibility that heavy pieces could crash 
down on the research facility."


{C6A300}
[Takeshi]
A-alright... I understand...


{T6T238}
[Mission Control]
"Of course, we're doing everything we can to 
get to you before that happens."


{T6T239}
[Mission Control]
"We're heading there no matter what! 
So please hang on a little longer!"

Click... The communications cut out suddenly.


9 :

{C6A301}
[Takeshi]
Ah, hey! W-wait a sec!


10 :
Takeshi hit the call button repeatedly.

But there was no answer.


11 :

{C6A302}
[Takeshi]
"Damn it, we can't open up communications 
from this side..."

Takeshi began reading through the manual on
the side of the communication terminal.


12 :

{C6A303}
[Takeshi]
Ah, here it is!

Following the instructions in the manual, he
used the control panel to call up information
on the monitor.


13 :

{C6A304}
[Takeshi]
It's a small electric submersible...

The submarine was in a separate sealed sector
attached to IBF.

The specifications said it was a 'neutral
buoyancy' miniature submarine for saturation
diving.

The important thing was that it could be brought
over to the pool by remote control.


14 :

{C6A305}
[Takeshi]
"If things get dangerous, I guess they want 
us to board this."

He quickly went about setting up the remote
control program so that they could move the
submarine at a moment's notice if they had to.


15 :

{C6A306}
[Takeshi]
Alright...


{C6A307}
[Takeshi]
All we have to do now is...


16 :

{C6A308}
[Takeshi]
Get Tsugumi and Sora over here...

The moment Takeshi said that‡L


17 :
‡LBOOOooom!


18 :
Suddenly, a low metallic crash reverberated
throughout the installation.

The sound seemed to come from above.


19 :
An alarm sounded from the terminal, and the
screen changed.


20 :
'Warning: flooding has occurred in LeMU'


{C6A309}
[Takeshi]
LeMU...!?


{C6A310}
[Takeshi]
This is bad...


{C6A311}
[Takeshi]
That means... Tsugumi and Sora...!


21 :
Takeshi ran out into the corridor.

It was only slight, but the floor was
trembling.


{C6A312}
[Takeshi]
Agh...

He suddenly seemed to get dizzy and lost his
balance, crashing into a wall.

Holding his fingers to his temples, Takeshi
shook his head to clear it.


{C6A313}
[Takeshi]
I... still gotta go...


{C6A314}
[Takeshi]
I have to GO!

Staggering while he ran, Takeshi took off.

His legs moved as if he couldn't distinguish
up from down but, still, he kept running.


22 :
He stumbled into the elevator...

The lift he was on started moving up...


{C6A315}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 90 meter...>


{C6A316}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 80 meter...>


{C6A317}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 70 meter...>


23 :
He ran from the lift to the compression
chamber...

Takeshi pressed the intercom button repeatedly.


24 :

{C6A318}
[Takeshi]
Sora! Soraaa!


{T6T243}
[Sora]
Ku-Kuranari-san!? What are you...?

Takeshi waved to Sora as she appeared outside
the window.


25 :

{C6A319}
[Takeshi]
Hey! It's been a while!


{T6T244}
[Sora]
Wh-what are you doing here!?


{C6A320}
[Takeshi]
Well, it's obvious, isn't it? I came back.

[Sora]
.........


26 :

{C6A321}
[Takeshi]
What's the damage?


{T6T245}
[Sora]
There's flooding in Zweiter Stock.


{T6T246}
[Sora]
"The warehouse area has been breached, and 
cracks are beginning to form in the elevator 
shaft. The situation is serious."


27 :

{T6T247}
[Sora]
"There is over fifteen centimeters of flooding in 
almost all of the corridors."


{C6A322}
[Takeshi]
Where's Tsugumi?


{T6T248}
[Sora]
She's... trapped in the infirmary...


{C6A323}
[Takeshi]
What about the door?


{T6T249}
[Sora]
The electronic lock has been released. But...


{C6A324}
[Takeshi]
It won't open 'cause of the water pressure?


{T6T250}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T6T251}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, I'm going to start decompressing the 
chamber."


{C6A325}
[Takeshi]
How long will it take?


{T6T252}
[Sora]
I will complete it as soon as possible.


{C6A326}
[Takeshi]
I need to know how much time!


{T6T253}
[Sora]
If I hurry... twelve hours.


28 :

{C6A327}
[Takeshi]
Tw-twelve hours!? We don't have that long!


{T6T254}
[Sora]
"If we don't dissolve the nitrogen in your 
blood, you will get decompression sickness."


{C6A328}
[Takeshi]
I don't care! Open that door now!


{T6T255}
[Sora]
I can't do that...!


{C6A329}
[Takeshi]
If we don't act fast, Tsugumi is dead!


{T6T256}
[Sora]
"If we open that door now, due to the rapid 
decompression, the nitrogen in your 
bloodstream will form bubbles, causing blood 
clots, and in the worst case..."


{C6A330}
[Takeshi]
I don't care, you get that door OPEN NOW!


{T6T257}
[Sora]
I can't... It's too...

Looking around, Takeshi's eyes fell on an
emergency escape lever inside the chamber.

Without hesitating, he pulled it down and
kicked the door.


29 :
‡LKABOooM!

There was a horrible noise, as though all the
air inside had exploded.

Takeshi's body was thrown from the room
along with the high-pressure gas that had
built up inside.

He was tossed like a piece of confetti,
sliding and rolling along the floor, only stopping
when he crashed into the wall.


{C6A331}
[Takeshi]
Gaagh!


{C6A332}
[Takeshi]
...EeeaaAAAAGGHH!


{C6A333}
[Takeshi]
WAAAAaaaah...

Takeshi twisted in agony.

He flailed his four limbs as though he were a
man gone insane.


{C6A334}
[Takeshi]
Urgh... uurrgh...

From his unnatural contorted position on the
floor, Takeshi began vomiting.


30 :

{T6T260}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san!


{T6T261}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... Are you okay?


{C6A335}
[Takeshi]
W-well... It looks like... I'm still alive...


31 :
Takeshi crawled weakly over the floor.

He crawled and stood, fell and rose
again... Then he fell backward...

Repeating that process over and over, he
finally made it to the door and said, leaning
his shoulder against the wall...


32 :

{C6A336}
[Takeshi]
"Don't you stop me, you hear? No matter what 
you say, I'm going."


33 :

{T6T262}
[Sora]
"Alright, Kuranari-san. It seems that you've made 
up your mind..."


{T6T263}
[Sora]
"I'll stay here in Himmel to keep track of 
the situation at LeMU and send updates to 
your PDA."


{T6T264}
[Sora]
"I'll do what I can to stop the partitions 
from failing... to see that this place stays 
together even a little while longer. So..."


34 :

{T6T265}
[Sora]
"Promise me... that you'll come back here with 
Komachi-san..."


35 :

{C6A337}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, it's a promise.

And saying that, he laughed weakly.


36 :
Running up the stairs, he looked down at his
PDA.

There was a life reading in the infirmary.

The map showed that the surrounding corridors
were flooded and that there was no way to
access the area.


37 :
Arriving at Zweiter Stock, he threw himself
into the water.

In order to reach the corridor connecting to
the infirmary... Takeshi dove.

At that point, there was no way to access it
without swimming.

{16:4}

38 :
Takeshi turned the PDA's backlight on.

It shined a weak light on the area before him.

Maybe he realized that there wasn't any
point, but Takeshi turned off the light and
kept swimming in total darkness.

He swam. And kept swimming.

Takeshi propelled himself forward as though
possessed.

{16:4}

39 :
There was no sign of fear or unease in the
way that he moved.

He fiercely tore at the wall of water
surrounding him, progressing steadily forward.

He was being reckless, perhaps even acting
insane... but he was willing to sacrifice it
all for what he was convinced he had to do.

{16:4}

40 :
And neither the water nor the intense
pressure could defeat the power of his faith
and the courage of that conviction.

He kept swimming on and on strongly,
purposefully.

Heading for the light...

{16:4}

41 :
SPLASH!‡LTakeshi sucked in air greedily
as he brought his head out of the water.

Ignoring his burning lungs, he quickly
climbed up the open hole of the elevator
shaft and began scrambling toward the
infirmary.


42 :

{C6A338}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!


43 :
She was in a corner of the room, hugging her
knees to herself.

At her feet was the slightly wet, furry
figure of Chami.


44 :

{T6T267}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi... Why... Why...!?

Tsugumi's eyes widened.


45 :

{C6A339}
[Takeshi]
What are you so surprised about, Tsugumi?


{C6A340}
[Takeshi]
I came back to pick you up! I came back for you!


{C6A341}
[Takeshi]
Well, I guess I'm a bit late, but...

Takeshi scratched his nose.


46 :

{T6T268}
[Tsugumi]
Y-you idiot! What are you doing here!?


{T6T269}
[Tsugumi]
Do you... want do die!?


47 :

{C6A342}
[Takeshi]
Listen...


48 :
Takeshi was laughing as he spoke.


49 :

{C6A343}
[Takeshi]
"I came back for something I forgot... Um, yeah, 
that's it."


50 :

{T6T270}
[Tsugumi]
You... forgot...?

Picking up Chami in both hands, she stood up
slowly.


{C6A344}
[Takeshi]
Yeah. Left it here, silly me...


{C6A345}
[Takeshi]
My irreplaceable...


{C6A346}
[Takeshi]
"More important to me than anything 
else... friend..."


51 :

{T6T271}
[Tsugumi]
...How...


{T6T272}
[Tsugumi]
How... did you get here?

She looked at Takeshi as if she still couldn't
believe he was really there.


52 :

{C6A347}
[Takeshi]
Well, I'm a good swimmer.


{C6A348}
[Takeshi]
"Actually, I swam down and back in a 25-meter 
pool once."


53 :

{C6A349}
[Takeshi]
I kicked off the wall coming back, but still...

Takeshi mimed swimming as he spoke.


54 :

{C6A350}
[Takeshi]
"Wait, I actually think I beat my record a while 
ago..."


55 :

{C6A351}
[Takeshi]
"Hey? Do you remember the furthest I've ever 
swum underwater?"


56 :

{T6T273}
[Tsugumi]
...Fi...


{T6T274}
[Tsugumi]
51 meters...?

She answered, her expression beginning to
break down.


{C6A352}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


{C6A353}
[Takeshi]
You think I'd die in a place like this?


{C6A354}
[Takeshi]
I mean...


{C6A355}
[Takeshi]
"I still haven't gotten enough abuse from you 
yet."


{C6A356}
[Takeshi]
"I want to hear what you've got to say from 
here on out..."


{T6T275}
[Tsugumi]
Aaagh...


57 :

{C6A357}
[Takeshi]
So...


{C6A358}
[Takeshi]
I came for you, Tsugumi.


{T6T276}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... Takeshi!


58 :
They both ran toward each other.

Reaching out their hands to one another, they
came together.

And in the center of the infirmary, they
hugged each other close, embracing firmly.

Riding on Tsugumi's shoulder was Chami...

Chami snorted and looked at the two.


59 :
.........

......

...


60 :
Having rescued Tsugumi from the infirmary,
Takeshi made it safely back to Himmel.

Sora was waiting for them back in the room.


{T6T278}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, Komachi-san!


{T6T279}
[Sora]
"I've prepared the chamber for you! Get inside, 
quickly!"


61 :

{C6A360}
[Takeshi]
Hey, what's the rush, Sora?

Although Takeshi was out of breath, he waved
the flustered Sora off with his hands.


{C6A361}
[Sora]
C-come on! You have to hurry!


{C6A362}
[Takeshi]
"Relax... I still have one more thing I've 
forgotten..."


62 :

{C6A363}
[Sora]
F-forgotten...? What?


63 :

{C6A364}
[Takeshi]
This.

Takeshi pointed to Himmel's console.


64 :
There were letters written on the monitor.


'Willkommen LeMMIH Login: T.Y.'

'LM-RSDS-4913A Akanegasaki Sora'

'Aktenkopie wird vervollständigt'


65 :
Suddenly, there was an intense flash of
light‡L

And from the blinding flood of light, a voice
could be heard...


{C6A366}
[Y¤u]
"I was able to finish the transfer just in 
time."


{C6A367}
[Y¤u]
The last password and name, T.Y....


{C6A368}
[Y¤u]
TANAKA YOICHI...

Where was this?‡L'I' wondered.

Was I inside someone...?

I couldn't see anything.

All I could hear was a voice coming from
somewhere.

A warm voice...

A murmuring filled with peace...


{C6A369}
[Y¤u]
It was in Himmel, along with Sora's memory...


{C6A370}
[Y¤u]
It's on that terabyte disc.


{C6A371}
[Y¤u]
Thank you... Dad.

The voice cut out suddenly.

The light faded.

Color gradually returned to Takeshi's field of
vision.


66 :
And when color had finally returned, Takeshi
opened his mouth.


67 :

{C6A372}
[Takeshi]
Haaa!


68 :

{C6A373}
[Takeshi]
Click!


69 :
Letting out a strange shout, Takeshi
pounded the enter key on the console.


70 :
A round, flat wafer shot out of the disc drive.


It was a single terabyte disc made out of
polycarbonate.


{C6A374}
[Takeshi]
Okay, I'm taking this with me.


71 :
Had Takeshi been able to hear Y¤u's voice?


He stuffed the disc in his pocket.


72 :

{C6A375}
[Sora]
Y-yes...

Taking a side-glance at the dumbfounded Sora,
Takeshi went along with Tsugumi to the other
side of the glass...


73 :
Into the compression chamber for IBF.


{T6T280}
[Tsugumi]
*Pant*... *pant*...

Slouching back in a chair, Tsugumi struggled
to catch her breath.


74 :

{C6A376}
[Takeshi]
Whew...


75 :
Takeshi breathed deeply... and looked out of
the window to the control room on the other
side.


76 :
The door to the chamber sealed, and
compression started...


77 :

{C6A377}
[Takeshi]
Sora...


{C6A378}
[Takeshi]
I guess this means goodbye for a while?

Sora was standing still on the other side of
the chamber.


78 :
Smiling softly, Sora shook her head left to
right.


{C6A380}
[Sora]
No, this isn't goodbye.


{C6A381}
[Sora]
I don't say... goodbye...


{C6A382}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


{C6A383}
[Takeshi]
Me neither.

Takeshi returned her smile.


79 :

{C6A384}
[Sora]
I do not exist.


{C6A385}
[Sora]
And yet‡LI exist everywhere.


{C6A386}
[Sora]
"There will be a time when we meet again. I'm 
sure of it."


80 :

{C6A388}
[Sora]
So please...


{C6A389}
[Sora]
Please don't ask me anything now.


{C6A390}
[Takeshi]
Okay...


{C6A391}
[Takeshi]
I understand... now.


{C6A392}
[Takeshi]
I don't know how, but I understand now.


{C6A393}
[Takeshi]
"That the only place to find you is here, yet 
I can find you anywhere..."


{C6A394}
[Sora]
Yes...


81 :

{C6A395}
[Takeshi]
O-oh, and...


{C6A396}
[Takeshi]
"When you hit a button, don't forget to say 
'click'. Remember that."


{C6A397}
[Sora]
Yeah... Heh heh.


{C6A398}
[Sora]
Don't worry. I will remember.


{C6A400}
[Sora]
"That's a promise. Mine and yours, 
Professor..."


{C6A401}
[Sora]
Thank you...

The RSD image started to warp and break up.

A fog enveloped Sora from behind.

Sora's image changed to a rainbow hue.

And then even the rainbow...

Started to fade.

Sora's form disappeared...

Takeshi watched it all happen and nodded as
though he had confirmed something.


82 :
Compression complete.

Takeshi and Tsugumi loaded into the elevator
and headed back to the research facility.


83 :

{T6T295}
[Tsugumi]
It's quiet...


{C6A402}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, you're right...

The flooding should have been fairly advanced
in the area above them.

It was hard to know if any of the sections had
collapsed yet.

But for the moment, everything was normal at
IBF.

On the surface of the pool, there wasn't
even a ripple.


84 :

{C6A403}
[Takeshi]
Ah...


85 :

{T6T296}
[Tsugumi]
What's wrong?


{C6A404}
[Takeshi]
The time... We're past the scheduled time.


86 :

{T6T297}
[Tsugumi]
What schedule?


87 :

{C6A405}
[Takeshi]
Actually, there's a rescue team on their way.


{T6T298}
[Tsugumi]
Rescue...?


{C6A406}
[Takeshi]
"Yeah, they called themselves the Maritime 
Defense Force, I think."


{C6A407}
[Takeshi]
"Y¤u was able to open up a communication line 
to Insel Null."


88 :
Talking that way, they made their way to
the examination room.

They opened the door and went inside.


89 :

{T6T299}
[Tsugumi]
Ah...


{T6T300}
[Tsugumi]
They aren't here... Nobody's here!?

Tsugumi raised her voice.

But there was nobody in the room to respond.

Takeshi checked each of the capsule pods.

But they were all empty.


{C6A408}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


{C6A409}
[Takeshi]
"Y¤u, the Kid, £o¢o, that old guy... They're 
all gone."


90 :

{T6T301}
[Tsugumi]
Where did they go?


91 :

{C6A410}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, hold on. I'm sure the rescue team found 
them."

Just then...

A recognizable voice came over the speaker.


92 :

{C6A411}
[Mission Control]
This is Insel Null Control. Please respond.


93 :
Takeshi jumped over to the terminal and hit
the talk button.


94 :

{C6A412}
[Takeshi]
This is the examination room in IBF Three, over!


{C6A413}
[Mission Control]
Thank goodness... That's where you were.


{C6A414}
[Mission Control]
"A little while ago, we got a message from the 
dispatch team that they couldn't find you. 
You had us worried there."


95 :

{C6A415}
[Takeshi]
I'm sorry, I was out for a bit.


{C6A416}
[Mission Control]
"We were able to rescue the other three 
people in the examination room, and they're 
being cared for in the salvage vessel."


{C6A417}
[Takeshi]
Is everyone okay!?


{C6A418}
[Mission Control]
"We can't say for sure... Their conditions are 
serious."


{C6A419}
[Mission Control]
"We're fighting against time. The submersible 
is going to surface soon, and we'll transfer 
them to a floating medical center."


96 :

{C6A420}
[Takeshi]
Okay. You take care of them.


{C6A421}
[Mission Control]
How many people are there with you?


{C6A422}
[Takeshi]
Two, including me.


97 :

{C6A423}
[Takeshi]
There's one person that didn't make it...


{C6A424}
[Mission Control]
"Roger. We'll send the team back there as 
soon as we can."


{C6A425}
[Mission Control]
"But there is the possibility that the team 
won't be able to approach IBF if it starts to 
break up."


98 :

{C6A426}
[Takeshi]
"I've got the exploration vessel standing by. 
I can call it here by remote control, right?"


{C6A427}
[Mission Control]
"Ah, yeah... I'm sorry to have to ask you to 
use it, but there's nothing else we can do."


{C6A428}
[Mission Control]
"We'll do the best we can. Whatever happens, 
you hang in there."


{C6A429}
[Takeshi]
Roger.

After that, the communications cut out.


99 :

{T6T313}
[Tsugumi]
What's that supposed to mean?


100 :

{C6A430}
[Takeshi]
You weren't listening?


{C6A432}
[Takeshi]
"All this would be for nothing if everyone 
died while they were waiting for us."


{C6A433}
[Takeshi]
"The rescue team decided to put a higher 
priority on getting Y¤u, the Kid, and £o¢o to 
the hospital rather than waiting for us."


101 :

{T6T314}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... You're right...

The color in Tsugumi's face slowly returned to
normal as her sense of panic faded.


102 :

{C6A434}
[Takeshi]
Well...


{C6A435}
[Takeshi]
"I might just take a nap until the next bus 
comes..."


103 :

{T6T315}
[Tsugumi]
B-bus?


104 :

{C6A436}
[Takeshi]
"If you think the bus is going to be late, 
call a taxi for me, will you?"


{T6T316}
[Tsugumi]
T-taxi?


{T6T317}
[Tsugumi]
What are you talking about... Takeshi?


{C6A437}
[Takeshi]
"If you push that button, a small submarine 
will come over here by remote control‡Lour 
very own private taxi should come here from 
another area of IBF."


105 :

{T6T318}
[Tsugumi]
O-okay...


{C6A438}
[Takeshi]
Anyway...


{C6A439}
[Takeshi]
I'm just glad that everyone's alright...


{C6A440}
[Takeshi]
Yes...

A look of relief flooded softly over his face.


106 :

{C6A441}
[Takeshi]
I'm just... so... glad...

Like a marionette that had its strings cut,
Takeshi's body collapsed.


107 :

{T6T319}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi!?


108 :
Tsugumi ran over to Takeshi and struggled to
hold him up.

She shook him by the shoulders, but Takeshi
would not wake up.

He was breathing, and his heartbeat seemed
normal. Although he felt slightly hot, it
didn't seem like his life was in danger.

Tsugumi carried Takeshi over to a bed.

And placing her head on his chest, she closed
her eyes.

The light sound of their breathing gradually
took on the same timing and softly filled
the room.


109 :
They fell into a deep sleep...


110 :
At the same time‡LI woke up suddenly.

LeMU's infirmary...

I had been sprawled out, sleeping on the bed.

Getting up, I looked around.

Nobody was there.

I felt a pain in my left hand.

I looked at my palm.

There was a large bandage on the edge of it.

That was right... I injured my hand in the Cosmic
Whale room... and then...

...And then... I lost my memory again and was
probably brought to that room.

(Where is everyone...?)

I slowly got off the bed and slipped on my
shoes.


111 :
Creak, creeeaak, creeeeaaaaaaaaaaak...


112 :
Groan, groan, groooooooaaaaaaaaaaaannn...

The sound of metal screeching and rubbing
together came from somewhere in the immediate
vicinity.


113 :
Another sound came to my ears, and I could
tell it was an alarm ringing somewhere far off.

But strangely, I didn't feel any fear.

I must not have been completely awake.


The inside of my head was still dim, and it was hard
to grasp the situation completely.

Just then...


114 :
‡LWhhhiiirr!


115 :
The door to the infirmary opened.


116 :

{S6A089}
[Y¤u]
Kid!

Y¤u jumped into the room as though she were
possessed by a demon.


{S6A091}
[Y¤u]
I found an exit we can escape through!

Y¤u was screaming.

'I found an exit'... I said those words to
myself over and over.

It took me a few seconds to grasp the
enormity of those words.

[Kid]
Where did you find it?

My mind was still not fully up and running.


{S6A090}
[Y¤u]
I'll explain later, just hurry!


117 :
Saying that, Y¤u ran out of the infirmary.

Still, it took a few more seconds for my legs
to get moving.


118 :
It felt as though I were running on fog.

My body was half-paralyzed and wouldn't move
in the direction I wanted it.

I shook my head, trying to get rid of the
grogginess.

No mater how much I ran, I couldn't return to
normal.

[Kid]
Where is everyone else...?

I was barely able to hold onto my
consciousness as I somehow got that
question off to Y¤u.


119 :

{S6A093}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari is going to get Mayo. Tsugumi is 
already at the emergency corridor."


120 :
[Kid]
Kuranari is going to get Mayo...

[Kid]
Tsugumi is in the emergency corridor...

For no reason in particular, I repeated Y¤u's
words.

Maybe she finally noticed my odd state. Y¤u
looked at me suspiciously.


121 :
We made it to the emergency corridor.

Kaburaki, Tsugumi, and Sara were already waiting
there.


122 :

{S6A094}
[Kaburaki]
Hurry, we don't have much time.

[Kid]
Not much time...?


{S6A095}
[Kaburaki]
Just hurry.

Kaburaki grabbed my shoulder hard and started
to run, turning around.


123 :
Sara and Tsugumi followed Kaburaki's lead.


124 :

{S6A096}
[Y¤u]
Listen. LeMU is already starting to collapse.


{S6A097}
[Y¤u]
"We were finally able to make contact with 
the surface, and now the emergency stairs 
are accessible."


{S6A098}
[Y¤u]
"But if we don't hurry, they're going to 
flood."


{S6A099}
[Y¤u]
So just hurry.

Y¤u grabbed my arm tightly.


125 :
And tugging on it violently, Y¤u started
pounding forward at full speed.

It felt like I was about to fall forward, and
I braced myself as best I could, trying to
keep pace with her as she pulled me forward.

We flew like the wind down the painfully
cramped passage...


126 :
And soon...


127 :
We had all jumped into the emergency exit
stairwell and were running up the stairs.

I could hear Kaburaki, Sara, and
Tsugumi... their footsteps right above me.


{S6A100}
[Kaburaki]
Hurry! This way!

I couldn't see from where Kaburaki was calling.

But his booming voice thundered off the sides
of the metal bulkhead.

Y¤u's eyes met mine, and we nodded to one
another. Our legs pumped harder, climbing
as fast as possible.

The surface of the stairs was wet.

The metal tube surrounding us on the emergency
staircase was shaking violently left and right.

I slipped and whacked my shin hard against a
corner.

But I felt nothing.

Both of my legs kept moving as if they were
separate from me.

My thoughts and feelings were indistinct,
vague.

An irresistible, primal force was
propelling me forward.

And I handed over the reins to that force.

It was a state almost free of thought. All I
could do was climb and climb and keep
climbing...

A sharp metallic sound echoed painfully in
my ears.

The angry cacophony shook my body to its core.

It was the screaming of a terrible
monster... or the groan of death itself.

The terrible voice was slowly and certainly
closing in on us from behind.


128 :

{S6A101}
[Kaburaki]
Just a little more! We're almost there!

Kaburaki screamed at us from up above.

I briefly saw the backs of Sara and Tsugumi,
who were running up ahead.

The meaning of Kaburaki's words, 'Just a
little more', hit me.

(Just a little more... and we can escape from
here...)

(From the bottom of the deep ocean... From out
of that cage we were trapped in...)

(We're finally getting out. We're going to be
free...)

But along with that hope...

An indistinct fear was still inside of me.


A heavy, dark, sensation wriggled at the
center of my body.

It was rotten, filthy...

It had stuck to the walls of my heart,
stagnant and putrid.

(It doesn't matter...)

(Even if you get out of here, nothing will
have been solved...)

As the doubts went through my mind, my
legs faltered.

Two steps, three steps, four steps, I carried
forward, and the doubt swelled up, replacing my
elation at rescue.

(You think... you're really going to be let
out of here...?)

As that thought filled my mind, I had
already arrived at the last step in front of
the door.

[Kaburaki]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

Nobody said a word.

We wiped our sweat and struggled for breath
as we glared at the huge door which rose
before us.

[Kid]
Alright, let's go.

I put my hand on the door's lever.


129 :
Clank...

The door unlocked.

Bracing my chest and shoulder against the
door, I threw all my weight into opening it.


130 :
Creeeeeeeaaakk...


131 :
BOOM...

.........

......

...


132 :
Outside of the door‡L

The sight that greeted us was a sky filled
with stars.

Covering the dark blue sky above was an
infinite number of shimmering stars.

Beyond time and beyond space, the light
poured down gently on our heads from above.

Y¤u, Sara, Tsugumi, Kaburaki and I... had
lost all words. We could only stare at the
sky above.

If I raised my hand, it seemed I could touch
the sky...

But not there... because it was a real night
sky.


133 :
In that way, the drama of our escape ended...

...Or at least so it seemed. But I realized
nothing had been solved.

The slimy sense of unease still gnawed inside
of me.

And that indistinct notion had changed to a
simmering sense of impatience. One that was
ready to boil.

(That's right, it isn't finished.)

(I'm not going to let it end here.)

(Because I... don't know... the reasons behind
any of this.)

The time was 11:43 p.m.‡L

A new day was just waiting to begin...
