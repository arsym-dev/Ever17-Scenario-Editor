1 :
[Takeshi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...

[Takeshi]
I'm sleepy...

The lack of sleep made the echo of the shoes
scraping the ground seem louder than usual.

As I walked down the emergency corridor, I
stretched.

Y¤u was next to me.

£o¢o and the Kid trailed a little way behind
us.


2 :

{T2A000}
[Y¤u]
And you slept so hard...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, but what time is it right 
now?"


{T2A001}
[Y¤u]
5:30 a.m.

[Takeshi]
"That's right. So that means I only 
slept four and a half hours."


3 :

{T2A002}
[Y¤u]
Not 'only'. You slept that much!


{T2A003}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know how you could sleep like that 
given our situation..."

[Takeshi]
"It's because it is this kinda situation that 
we've gotta sleep."

[Takeshi]
"Our minds have to be sharp. We have to be 
ready for anything, right?"


4 :

{T2A004}
[Y¤u]
So your mind is sharp right now?


5 :
[Takeshi]
"Well, I'm still a bit sleep-deprived, so not 
all my pistons are firing..."

[Takeshi]
"But I think I'm doing about as good as the 
next guy."

[Takeshi]
Hey, aren't you...?

The next thing I noticed, Y¤u was no longer
next to me.

I stopped and looked back.


6 :
I saw the Kid and £o¢o vanish into a small
side corridor to the right.

I hurried after the three of them.


7 :

{T2A005}
[Y¤u]
And? How is sleeping beauty...?

Y¤u spoke to me sarcastically once I'd caught
up.

[Takeshi]
"I just told you. I'm not running at full 
power."


8 :

{T2A006}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*...

Y¤u let out an exasperated sigh and shrugged
her shoulders.

She also arched an eyebrow as if annoyed.


9 :

{T2A007}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari...


{T2A008}
[Y¤u]
"You know, I think you'd better take a look 
in the mirror."

[Takeshi]
Huh? Mirror?


10 :

{T2A009}
[Y¤u]
You'd... really better wash your face.


11 :
We entered the emergency stairs from the
emergency corridor.

We had just been roused from sleep by Sora,
and the four of us shuffled to the control
room on the third floor, Dritter Stock.

We seemed to have passed through the
decompression process without a hitch, as no
one had any complaints.

Even £o¢o, who had seemed to be having such a
rough time, was...


12 :

{T2A010}
[£o¢o]
Sunny, sunny, Sunday~


{T2A011}
[£o¢o]
Windy, windy, Wednesday~


{T2A012}
[£o¢o]
Pretty, pretty Pipi today~


{PIPI_02}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

Even the dog seemed in high spirits.

They looked even happier than the day before.


13 :
The water on the corridor floor splashed and
sprayed as we walked.

Y¤u, walking next to me, had clammed up.


(I wonder what she's peeved about...)

I slowed down my pace to walk with the Kid.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, you got any idea what Y¤u's all miffed 
about?"


14 :

{T2A013}
[Kid]
Who knows?

The Kid answered, grinning.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, what're you laughing about? Do you know 
something that I don't?"


15 :

{T2A014}
[Kid]
"You sure you don't have any ideas what it 
could be?"

[Takeshi]
If I did, I wouldn't be asking you.

[Takeshi]
Y¤u told me to 'look in the mirror', but...


16 :

{T2A015}
[Kid]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T2A016}
[Kid]
That's no fun...


17 :
The Kid kept glancing at my face and trying
not to smile.

(My face...?)

I wiped the palm of my hand on my face.

It looked like black ink was smeared there.


[Takeshi]
What's this?

I tried to wipe it off with my shirt collar.

But it wouldn't come off.


18 :

{T2A017}
[Kid]
Haha...


{T2A018}
[Kid]
Oh, there's a toilet over there.

[Takeshi]
.........


19 :
The faucet was broken, and the sink was
overflowing with water.


20 :
I hurriedly washed my hands and then my face.

The mirror in front of me was shattered into
so many shards that it was useless.

But most of the black had come off of my
hands, so I thought my face was probably
alright.

[Takeshi]
Damn, that girl...

I said it disgustedly and hurried out of the
bathroom.


21 :
I went up to Y¤u again.

[Takeshi]
Hey, you! What did you write on my face?


22 :

{T2A019}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
"While I was asleep, you scribbled all over my 
face, didn't you?"


{T2A020}
[Y¤u]
Scribble?

As she walked, Y¤u gaped at my face.


23 :

{T2A021}
[Y¤u]
What are you talking about...?


{T2A022}
[Y¤u]
You're probably still asleep.

[Takeshi]
Don't play dumb with me, Y¤u!

[Takeshi]
You were just talking about a mirror.


{T2A023}
[Y¤u]
Oh, was I? A mirror?

[Takeshi]
You said it. I know you said it.


{T2A024}
[Y¤u]
"Are you sure your ears aren't playing tricks 
on you? I'm pretty sure you're still half 
asleep."

[Takeshi]
Then what's this?

I showed her my shirt collar where I had
wiped the ink.


24 :

{T2A025}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm, what...?

Y¤u mumbled that, so I stepped closer...


{T2A026}
[Y¤u]
Well...

Suddenly she grabbed my hand and stared at my
palm intently.


25 :

{T2A027}
[Y¤u]
"Oh! Your palm has an interesting future 
for you."

[Takeshi]
Palm reading? Is that what you're into now?


26 :

{T2A028}
[Y¤u]
"Your palm tells me that your fate diverges 
into two distinctly different futures."


{T2A029}
[Y¤u]
It's kind of an all or nothing outcome.


{T2A030}
[Y¤u]
You will either acquire or lose everything...

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2A031}
[Y¤u]
"One path will put you on the road to riches, 
a good job, an encounter with a beautiful 
woman, and bless you with a strong home and 
offspring."


{T2A032}
[Y¤u]
And you will be as healthy as possible...


{T2A033}
[Y¤u]
"You will live to a ripe old age that will 
make those around you jealous."


{T2A034}
[Y¤u]
HOWEVER! HOWEVER!


{T2A035}
[Y¤u]
"If you take the other path... you will be in 
dire straits."

[Takeshi]
D-dire...?


27 :

{T2A036}
[Y¤u]
Yes... but I can tell you no more.


{T2A037}
[Y¤u]
"You should take a good look at the middle of 
your lifeline."


{T2A038}
[Y¤u]
"Because that is where the answer can be 
found."


28 :

{T2A039}
[Y¤u]
Heeheehee...


29 :
I looked down at the palm of my hand.

My eyes traced a line down my lifeline.

Wide-eyed, I scrutinized each wrinkle and line.


But I didn't see an answer anywhere.

There was still black ink in the creases of
my hand.

Black ink...

Black ink...

Black ink!?

I remembered what I was angry about. Forget
fortune telling!

[Takeshi]
Y-you! You're trying to trick me...

[Takeshi]
...Hey, what!?

The next thing I noticed, Y¤u was no longer
next to me.

I stopped and looked back.


30 :
I saw the Kid and £o¢o vanish into a small
side corridor to the left.

[Takeshi]
Whoa! Geez! I don't believe these guys!

I hurried after the three of them.


31 :
Tsugumi was in front of the control room.

She was leaning against the wall with her arms
folded and head down.

32 :
{11:0-93}
{11:1}Talk to her

{11:1}Wait and see what she says


33 :
I wondered where she could have run off to
the day before... but decided not to ask.

I decided to shower her with the cheeriest
greeting I could muster.


34 :
[Takeshi]
GOOD MORNING!

[Takeshi]
"How are you feeling? If you aren't feeling 
good, you should probably get to the 
decompression chamber!"

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi didn't budge.

She stood there with her mouth half-open, only
blinking her eyes a couple of times.

[Takeshi]
"What's the matter? You tired? Low blood 
pressure?"

[Takeshi]
"Well, I didn't exactly sleep like a baby 
either. That damn room was so small that I ended 
up sitting on the floor all night..."

I yawned and rubbed my eyes with both hands
as I spoke.


35 :
But then Tsugumi's eyes narrowed into slits,
and she leveled a steely glare at me.

It was the kind of look that could kill.


{T2A040}
[Tsugumi]
You...


36 :

{T2A041}
[Tsugumi]
...Are the absolute worst.


37 :
I peered at Tsugumi's face.

I was curious where she had gone off to the
day before...

She could at least have given me a hint.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi didn't budge.

She stood there with her mouth half-open, only
blinking her eyes a couple of times.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


38 :

{T2A042}
[Tsugumi]
What?

Tsugumi finally spoke.


39 :

{T2A043}
[Tsugumi]
You got a problem?

Then she scowled.

[Takeshi]
Huh? Oh... good... morning...

[Takeshi]
"Did you get a good sleep last night? I 
didn't. That damn room was so small that I ended 
up sitting on the floor all night..."

I yawned and rubbed my eyes with both hands
as I spoke.

[Takeshi]
So what did you do after that yesterday?


40 :
But then Tsugumi's eyes narrowed into slits,
and she leveled a steely glare at me.

It was the kind of look that could kill.


{T2A044}
[Tsugumi]
Your face is...


41 :

{T2A045}
[Tsugumi]
...The absolute worst.


42 :
[Takeshi]
Huh?


43 :
Tsugumi shook her head as if she was fed up
with me and vanished inside the control room.

(...A-absolute worst?)

[Takeshi]
Hey! Hold on a sec!


{T2A046}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...

Sora's voice came from behind me.


44 :

{T2A047}
[Sora]
What are you doing there?


{T2A048}
[Sora]
Please hurry inside.

[Takeshi]
But...


{T2A049}
[Sora]
Just please... go inside.

The expression on her face appeared more
stressed than the day before.

It seemed as if her face said... that something
serious was unfolding...


45 :

{T2A050}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry that I had to have you gather 
so early. There was no other way."


{T2A051}
[Sora]
"Actually, everyone, there is something 
I need to tell you right away."

Sora paused for a second.

Sora looked at all five of us in turn... Y¤u,
Tsugumi, £o¢o, the Kid, and me.

The cooling fan whirred away in the silence.


Occasionally, the sound of metal on metal
rang through the room.

The five of us waited on Sora's next words.


{T2A052}
[Sora]
"Last night, after the four of you apart from 
Komachi-san entered the pressurization chamber..."


{T2A053}
[Sora]
"I was in the control room here, thinking 
about ways to escape or contact the outside."


{T2A054}
[Sora]
And...


{T2A055}
[Sora]
"While I was checking the internal status of 
LeMU, I discovered something."


{T2A056}
[Y¤u]
You found a way to escape!?


{T2A057}
[Sora]
No.


{T2A058}
[Kid]
Then a way to contact the outside?


{T2A059}
[Sora]
Not yet.

[Takeshi]
Then what did you figure out?


46 :

{T2A060}
[Sora]
Actually...


47 :

{T2A061}
[Sora]
"I discovered the amount of pressure the 
bulkheads can withstand... I found their 
limits."


48 :
Saying that, Sora turned her eyes to the side
of the console.


49 :
In the darkness, a three-dimensional image of
LeMU sprung up.


50 :

{T2A062}
[£o¢o]
What's the... pressure bulkhead thingy...?

£o¢o held Pipi tightly as she asked.


{T2A063}
[Sora]
"I mean LeMU's walls. The partitions between 
the outer seawater and the inner air."


{T2A064}
[Kid]
"What do you mean... when you say you found the 
limit?"


{T2A065}
[Sora]
"Like I said yesterday, LeMU is a structure 
basically constructed on a saturation diving 
specification design."


{T2A066}
[Sora]
"In other words, the internal air pressure 
equals or is greater than the external water 
pressure."


{T2A067}
[Sora]
"However, the complex's internal air pressure 
is currently at one atmosphere..."


{T2A068}
[Sora]
Therefore...


{T2A069}
[Y¤u]
"LeMU's outer shell is constantly being 
subjected to severe water pressure."


{T2A070}
[Sora]
Correct.


{T2A071}
[Y¤u]
"But LeMU is not constructed to endure this 
situation for a long period of time."


51 :

{T2A072}
[Y¤u]
"Inevitably, it will, at some point, reach its 
limit..."


{T2A073}
[Sora]
Well put, Tanaka-san.

[Takeshi]
So... when is this limit...?


{T2A074}
[Sora]
"According to LeMMIH's calculations, 119 
hours from now..."


{T2A075}
[Tsugumi]
119 hours...


{T2A076}
[Tsugumi]
Five days, huh?


{T2A077}
[Sora]
"The estimated time of implosion is 
approximately 4:30 a.m. on May 7th."


{T2A078}
[Sora]
"Of course, it is only a calculation, and 
there is a margin of error."


{T2A079}
[Tsugumi]
What is the margin of error?


{T2A080}
[Sora]
Plus or minus twelve hours.

[Takeshi]
Hmmm...

Everyone went silent, lost in thought.

Sora's talk had made it clear that we were in
a crisis.

But I still didn't know what to make of it.

I didn't know if five days was a long time
or a short one.

We didn't have a schedule... but if we could
find a way out, I didn't figure we'd be
sticking around five days.

Even if we didn't call anyone, a rescue team
might have been on its way anyway...


52 :

{T2A081}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey! Sora-san?


{T2A082}
[£o¢o]
"I'm not very smart, so I'm not sure I 
understand... What does all that mean?"


53 :

{T2A083}
[Sora]
?


{T2A084}
[£o¢o]
"Does that mean at 4:30 a.m. on May 7th, LeMU 
will get squashed like a pancake?"


{T2A085}
[£o¢o]
"But that might happen at around 4:30 p.m. 
on the 6th or at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th."


{T2A086}
[£o¢o]
Is that okay so far?


{T2A087}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T2A088}
[£o¢o]
"So doesn't that mean the opposite is also 
true?"


{T2A089}
[£o¢o]
"I mean, at the worst, LeMU will last until 
4:30 p.m. on May 6th."


54 :

{T2A090}
[£o¢o]
"So we're fine until then. There's nothing to 
worry about. Hooray~"


55 :

{T2A091}
[£o¢o]
Right? Is that what it means?


{T2A092}
[Sora]
"We can't be absolutely certain that we will 
be safe..."


{T2A093}
[Sora]
"But judging from the results of LeMMIH's 
calculations, that would appear to be the case."


{T2A094}
[£o¢o]
Oh, goodie. Then no problem.


{T2A095}
[£o¢o]
"Sora-san, you looked all serious, and so I 
got kind of scared."


{PIPI_28}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*! *Wooooooof*!


{T2A096}
[£o¢o]
"'Geez, don't scare me, babe.' I think that's 
what Pipi's trying to say."


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!


56 :

{T2A097}
[Y¤u]
"I see... If you had said, 'We only have one 
more day', or something, I might have burst 
out crying."


{T2A098}
[Y¤u]
"So we still have lots of time... Someone 
will surely come to help us before that, right?"


57 :
The Kid, standing next to Y¤u, agreed.

He nodded rhythmically, as if answering a
question.


58 :
The tension in the air gave way and smiles
returned to the faces around the room.


59 :
Even Tsugumi, who didn't smile, looked
relieved.


60 :
It was 5:50 a.m.

I gave a large yawn.


61 :
[Takeshi]
Alright, all done!

[Takeshi]
One, two, three, four, five, six... That's all of them.

I was in the narrow space of the tuna
sandwich stand where the cooking equipment was.

I was wrapping and placing the freshly made
breakfast sandwiches on a tray.

[Takeshi]
"Why is it that I have to make breakfast for 
everyone?"

Complaining, I took the tray in both hands and
opened the small door of the stand.


62 :

{T2A099}
[Y¤u]
"That's the way it goes. We decided it 
democratically, you know."

Y¤u was waiting in front of the shop and
snatched a sandwich from the tray.

She peeled back the wrapping and opened up her
mouth.

[Takeshi]
Democracy... is overrated...

[Takeshi]
It just means the majority rules.


63 :

{T2A100}
[Y¤u]
You got it.

Y¤u said it flatly as she munched on her
sandwich.


{T2A101}
[Y¤u]
"It is a reflection of the majority of the 
people's will."

It was true that it had been an overwhelming
vote.

I had only been appointed breakfast chief
minutes before...

I hadn't even run for the office.

[Takeshi]
"I know that you're the one in the shadows 
running this conspiracy."


64 :

{T2A102}
[Y¤u]
Whoa, that's low! I wouldn't do that!


65 :

{T2A103}
[Y¤u]
"I'm pretty sure it's just because everyone 
sincerely thought that you would be the best 
cook."

[Takeshi]
...You're sure full of it.


66 :

{T2A104}
[Y¤u]
Tee heeeee...


{T2A105}
[Y¤u]
Thanks for the sandwich!

[Takeshi]
You already ate it? That's so fast...


{T2A106}
[Y¤u]
Yummy. I'll have another...


67 :
Tsk!


68 :
I slapped away Y¤u's outstretched hand.

[Takeshi]
I've only made one for each person.

[Takeshi]
If you want another one, you make it.


69 :

{T2A107}
[Y¤u]
Hey...


{T2A108}
[Y¤u]
"Come on. Oh, great Takeshi, make me one more...
pretty pleeeeeeease~"


70 :
First, I wanted to get away from Y¤u.

I took the remaining four sandwiches over to
the rest area to hand them out.


71 :
[Takeshi]
Breakfast is ready! Come and get it!

As I called out, I set the tray on a bench.


{T2A109}
[£o¢o]
Yeah! Yeah! Food, glorious food~


72 :
£o¢o came running and splashing toward me.
Pipi the dog paddled along behind her.


73 :

{T2A110}
[Kid]
Oh, this looks good!

All of a sudden, I noticed the Kid beside me.

[Takeshi]
Hey. Where are Tsugumi and Sora?


74 :

{T2A111}
[Kid]
Sora went back to the control room.


{T2A112}
[Kid]
"She said there was still stuff she had to 
look into..."

[Takeshi]
Oh, that again...


75 :

{T2A113}
[£o¢o]
Hmmm. I think Tsugumin took off somewhere...

[Takeshi]
Same old, same old...


76 :
I turned my eyes to the three tuna
sandwiches left on the tray.

(What to do...)

77 :
{11:0-95}
{11:1}Look for Tsugumi

{11:1}Go see Sora in the control room


78 :
First, I decided to go look for Tsugumi.

I would go see Sora after that.

I took their sandwiches in hand and left the
room.


79 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi!

I called out as I walked corridors at random.

'Choooowww tiiiimmmme!'

I knew she wasn't the type to answer to that...


80 :
Finally...

At the end of a corridor, I spied Tsugumi.


81 :
[Takeshi]
Oh, there she is.

[Takeshi]
What are you doing here?

'HIMMEL' was written on the door...

Tsugumi wasn't really doing anything. She just
stood in front of the door.


{T2A114}
[Tsugumi]
Nothing...


{T2A115}
[Tsugumi]
It's none of your business...

[Takeshi]
'None of my business', huh...?

[Takeshi]
Sure... Whatever.


{T2A116}
[Tsugumi]
What are YOU doing here?

[Takeshi]
This.

I held out one of the tuna sandwiches to
Tsugumi.


82 :

{T2A117}
[Tsugumi]
What's this?

[Takeshi]
Breakfast.


{T2A118}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmmm...

[Takeshi]
You're not gonna eat?

Tsugumi tilted her head a little and stared
at the sandwich.

[Takeshi]
If you don't want it, I'll give it to Y¤u.


83 :

{T2A119}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't say I don't want it...

Tsugumi indifferently took the sandwich from
me.

[Takeshi]
Good. I went to a lot of pain to make that.

[Takeshi]
"If you said you didn't want it, I don't know 
what I'd..."


84 :
Tsugumi began to walk away without listening
as I was talking.

[Takeshi]
H-hey! Hold on a second!


85 :
I suddenly grabbed Tsugumi's shoulder.

[Takeshi]
You should at least say thanks.

Tsugumi didn't try to turn around.

She shook my hand off of her shoulder
effortlessly.


86 :

{T2A120}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...

She let out an annoyed sigh.


{T2A121}
[Tsugumi]
Don't... touch me...

Tsugumi said it in a low voice without turning
around.

My shrugged-off hand floated in the air with
nowhere to go.


87 :

{T2A122}
[Tsugumi]
Don't...


{T2A123}
[Tsugumi]
Touch me...


88 :
Tsugumi repeated the same words again and
silently started walking away.

Down the water-covered floor of the corridor...

Rings rippled out slowly from where Tsugumi
stepped as she walked away.


89 :
Just then, the lights in the corridor began to
flicker uneasily.

I instinctively glanced up at the ceiling.

Listening carefully, I heard a sound like the
rumble of thunder far away.

90 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what...?

[Takeshi]
What is happening...? It couldn't be...

Tiny waves formed in the water pooled on the floor.


The walls and ceiling trembled slightly.
Metal screeched on metal.

I could see Tsugumi's back down the corridor.


91 :
The lights clicked and flickered. Tsugumi
turned and looked back at me.


92 :
As if she wanted to say something to me...


93 :
Darkness blanketed us.

The tremors and sounds stopped, but an eerie
silence filled the area.

Only the emergency lights glowed dimly.


94 :
[Takeshi]
...Is this a blackout?

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!

I kicked up water as I ran.


95 :
I ran to where Tsugumi was, shouting.


96 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! It's a blackout! A blackout!


{T2A124}
[Tsugumi]
I know...

[Takeshi]
What should we do?


97 :

{T2A125}
[Tsugumi]
Why're you asking me...?

[Takeshi]
Oh yeah... Right...

[Takeshi]
So what should we do?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"I know! First, we should go to where everyone 
is."


98 :
We cut through a nearby door and came out in
front of the kiosk.

Y¤u wasn't there.


99 :
I sprinted to the room next door. There was
no sign of anyone there either.

I scanned the area.

My eyes weren't used to the darkness yet, and I
couldn't see into the corners of the room.

[Takeshi]
Hey! £o¢o! Kid! Y¤u!

The echo of my voice was swallowed, vanishing
into the darkness.

[Takeshi]
Where could they have gone?

My eyes stopped on the bench.

On top of the tray I'd left, there was one
tuna sandwich remaining.

I still had one of the sandwiches in my
hand...

The emergency didn't seem to faze Tsugumi, who
was stuffing her face with the sandwich I'd
given her.


100 :

{T2A126}
[Tsugumi]
Hey...

[Takeshi]
?


{T2A127}
[Tsugumi]
This...

Tsugumi handed me something.

It was the balled up sandwich wrapper.


{T2A128}
[Tsugumi]
...Needs to be thrown away.


101 :
Saying that, Tsugumi left the room.

(Geez. I can't believe that girl...)

I took the crumpled-up wrapper, put it
back on the tray, and soon followed after
Tsugumi.


102 :
‡LIn front of the control room.

In the far darkness, I could just make out
three familiar outlines.


103 :

{T2A129}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari!


{T2A130}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin!


104 :
Splashing through the water, the three of them
walked over.


105 :

{T2A131}
[Kid]
Hey, have you seen Sora?

I looked at Tsugumi.

She shook her head.

[Takeshi]
Wasn't she in the control room?


{T2A132}
[Y¤u]
It's empty now.

[Takeshi]
You sure? Let's check...


106 :
I pushed the panel next to the door, but the
button remained lifeless.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, how do you open this? Does the 
electricity have to be on?"


{T2A133}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, there is an emergency mechanism for 
opening the door near the bottom of it..."


107 :
I decided to look in on Sora first.

I'd look for Tsugumi later.

I took their sandwiches in hand and left the
room.


108 :
[Takeshi]
Which way was it?

I'd gone as far as the corner before I
realized that I didn't know the route.

[Takeshi]
Maybe it's this way...


109 :
Finally...


110 :
I found a room where the corridor played out.

'HIMMEL' was written on the door...

[Takeshi]
No, this isn't it.

I retraced my route.


111 :
[Takeshi]
Alright, here it is...

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora! It's time for dinner!


112 :
I pushed the open button next to the door.

But the door didn't open.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, Sora! Open up! I brought you food! Time 
to eat!"


113 :
I shouted into the interphone as I pushed the
button to talk.


{T2A134}
[Sora]
Eat?

She replied to me through the speaker.


{T2A135}
[Sora]
"Thanks for going to the trouble, but I don't 
need any food..."

[Takeshi]
You don't? Don't say that.

[Takeshi]
Sora, have you been eating okay?

[Takeshi]
"You have to eat, or you're not going to have 
any energy."

[Sora]
.........


{T2A136}
[Sora]
I'm sorry, but I'm occupied at the moment.

I remembered that we'd had the same
exchange the day before.

[Takeshi]
"Hurry it up. These sandwiches are gonna get 
cold."

[Takeshi]
Besides, I made them special for you~

[Takeshi]
"Listen... I just wanna give these to you, so 
will you open the door?"


{T2A137}
[Sora]
I really can't...

[Takeshi]
C'mon. Please, just open the door, Sora-san.

[Takeshi]
"...I'll throw in a coupon for a beer if you 
want."


{T2A138}
[Sora]
I'm sorry...

We kept arguing through the speaker.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Alright then! I'm only going to wait out 
here for one more minute!"


{T2A139}
[Sora]
"One more minute? You're giving me a hard 
time..."


{T2A140}
[Sora]
I have to go somewhere...

[Takeshi]
Huh? Somewhere where?

[Sora]
...

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora, where are you going? Hello? Hello?


114 :
I pushed the button again and again, shouting.

But Sora didn't answer.


115 :
Just then, the lights in the corridor began to
flicker uneasily.

Instinctively, I looked to the ceiling.

Listening carefully, I heard a sound like the
rumble of thunder far away.


116 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what...?

[Takeshi]
What's happening? It couldn't be...

Tiny waves formed in the water pooled on the floor.


The walls and ceiling trembled slightly.
Metal screeched on metal.

As if they were trying to say something to
me...


117 :
Darkness blanketed me.

The tremors and sounds stopped, but an eerie
silence filled the area.

Only the emergency lights glowed dimly.


118 :
[Takeshi]
...Is this a blackout?

(I wonder what happened to Sora?)

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora! Answer me!


119 :
Bang, bang!

I pounded the door.

I thought she might not be able to hear me
inside...


120 :
Bang, bang!


121 :
Then I tapped the interphone button.

But there was no response.

(Oh... I wonder if the interphone needs
electricity to work...)

I had no clue what was happening on the other
side of the door.

(I figured the only thing I could do was get
the door open...)

I heard footsteps approaching from the
darkened corridor.

[Takeshi]
Who's there?

In the far darkness, I could just make out four
familiar outlines.


122 :

{T2A141}
[Y¤u]
Oh, Kuranari!


{T2A142}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon!


123 :
Splashing through the water, the four of them
walked over.


124 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


125 :

{T2A143}
[Kid]
Hey, have you seen Sora?

[Takeshi]
"No, but she was inside here until just a bit 
ago. But now she won't answer. And it seems 
like the door is locked..."


{T2A144}
[Y¤u]
What happened?

[Takeshi]
"I dunno. Anyway, let's get inside. How do we 
get this open?"


{T2A145}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, there is an emergency mechanism for 
opening the door near the bottom of it..."


126 :
Pulling on the lever, I pushed the door over
to the side.

The door opened just wide enough for a person
to squeeze through.


127 :
I peeked inside the room.

It was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing.


{T2A146}
[Kid]
Do you want a flashlight?

[Takeshi]
Oh, thanks.


128 :
I gave the Kid the sandwich and took the
flashlight.

I turned it on and stepped into the room.


129 :
Taking the flashlight, I turned it on and
stepped into the room.


130 :
A white circle of light appeared on the wall.

I shined the flashlight left and right,
lighting up all corners of the room.

The electrical system was completely down.

Like an abandoned castle, there was no sign of
warmth left.

There was clearly nobody there.


131 :
[Takeshi]
Well... what should we do?

I joined everyone and asked that calmly.

It had been one crisis after another since
the day before...

I guessed we were already used to the situation
because nobody had lost it.


{T2A147}
[Y¤u]
"I can't believe Sora would take off without 
saying anything first."

Y¤u tilted her head as she said that.


132 :
[Takeshi]
Hmmm?

Looking at her then, I noticed something.

[Takeshi]
Y¤u, when did you change clothes?


133 :

{T2A148}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Oh, this...?

Y¤u was wearing clothes I hadn't remembered
seeing.


134 :

{T2A149}
[Y¤u]
I spilled sauce all over my uniform...


{T2A150}
[Y¤u]
"I had one change of clothes in the changing 
room. These are my everyday clothes."

[Takeshi]
Hmm, I see... So you had a change of clothes.

[Takeshi]
"Spilling sauce on your uniform? That's pretty 
clumsy."


{T2A151}
[Y¤u]
Hahaha...

Y¤u scratched her head as if to offset her
embarrassment.

[Takeshi]
Anyway, we should be thinking about Sora.


{T2A152}
[£o¢o]
Yeah. For now...


135 :

{T2A153}
[£o¢o]
Everybody, let's split up and look for Sora-san.


{T2A154}
[£o¢o]
"Without Sora-san around, we won't know why there 
was a blackout or anything..."


{T2A155}
[Kid]
Yeah. Sora knows more about LeMU than anyone.

[Takeshi]
Hmmm... Alright, let's do this.

[Takeshi]
"Y¤u and the Kid, you guys check this floor. 
Tsugumi, £o¢o, and I will hit the second 
floor..."

[Takeshi]
Okay?


136 :

{T2A156}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Alright.


{T2A157}
[Kid]
Roger that.


{T2A158}
[£o¢o]
Uh... Um... What about Pipi?

[Takeshi]
He'll go with you, of course.

I petted Pipi's head.

[Takeshi]
Alright, let's go search!


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!


137 :
[Takeshi]
Sora! Sora!

The three people and one mutt (myself,
Tsugumi, £o¢o, and Pipi) split up once we
reached Zweiter Stock.


138 :
‡LThe entrance to the neutral buoyancy elevator.


139 :
‡LInside the infirmary.


140 :
‡LThe changing room.


141 :
‡LThe security office.


142 :
‡LThe merry-go-round.


143 :
We searched everything, even the Jellyfish
Gondola...


144 :
Then we retraced our way back to the front of
the infirmary.

And then...


{T2A159}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon! Takepyon!


{PIPI_27}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*!


145 :
£o¢o was shaking the flashlight and signaling
to me.

I had handed it to her before we started
searching.

[Takeshi]
How'd it go? Any luck?

£o¢o used the flashlight to make a big X,
signifying nothing found.


146 :

{T2A160}
[£o¢o]
How about you?

[Takeshi]
Nothing. She's not on this floor.

[Takeshi]
What about Tsugumi?


{T2A161}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin just passed by in front of me.

[Takeshi]
Passed by?


147 :

{T2A162}
[£o¢o]
"She went that way... toward the entrance to 
Ei the egg elevator."

[Takeshi]
The neutral buoyancy elevator, huh?


148 :

{T2A163}
[£o¢o]
Yeah.


{T2A164}
[£o¢o]
She was carrying something big.

Something big?

It sounded like Tsugumi was up to something
solo again...

[Takeshi]
I'll go check it out.

£o¢o and I moved to the room next door.


149 :
There were signs of someone there.

Ahead, in the total darkness, was something
rustling around.


{T2A165}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin?

Calling out, £o¢o shined the light on the
shadow.


150 :

{T2A166}
[Tsugumi]
...Hey, that's bright.

As expected, it was Tsugumi. She held out the
palms of her hands as she stood up.


151 :
£o¢o hurried to turn off the flashlight and
rushed over by Tsugumi.

I followed her over with Pipi.


152 :

{T2A167}
[£o¢o]
What are you doing here?


{T2A168}
[Tsugumi]
Huh? Hmph...


{T2A169}
[£o¢o]
I don't understand what you mean by 'Hmph'.

[Tsugumi]
...


{T2A170}
[£o¢o]
Hey, what were you doing?


153 :

{T2A171}
[Tsugumi]
Looking into something.


{T2A172}
[£o¢o]
What?


{T2A173}
[Tsugumi]
This elevator.


{T2A174}
[£o¢o]
Ei, the egg elevator?


{T2A175}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...


{T2A176}
[£o¢o]
"What do you need this big thing to 
investigate for?"

£o¢o pointed down by Tsugumi's feet.

There lay a massive plastic case.


I was sure I'd seen it... in the warehouse the
day before.

It looked like a toolbox, but...


154 :

{T2A177}
[Tsugumi]
I'm gonna need this later.


{T2A178}
[Tsugumi]
"Right now, I'm just checking the status of the 
elevator."


{T2A179}
[Tsugumi]
"Whether it'll move or the doors open 
manually..."

Tsugumi was way more talkative than usual.

Her attitude toward £o¢o was much nicer than
the one she had toward me.

It seemed to me that £o¢o's unique
personality kept even Tsugumi off balance.


{T2A180}
[£o¢o]
Hmmm...


{T2A181}
[£o¢o]
"So how about it? Does it look like the 
elevator will move?"


155 :

{T2A182}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe.

Tsugumi glanced at me as she said that.


{T2A183}
[£o¢o]
"Hey, but what good would using the elevator 
do you?"


156 :

{T2A184}
[Tsugumi]
I thought we'd go down to the third floor...


{T2A185}
[£o¢o]
"Third floor? Why don't we just use the 
emergency stairs like we always do?"


{T2A186}
[Tsugumi]
"Because those stairs won't get us where we 
need to go."


157 :

{T2A187}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


{T2A188}
[Tsugumi]
They won't get us to the generator room.


{T2A189}
[£o¢o]
Generator room?

That reminded me of what Y¤u had said.

LeMU didn't receive any power from the
outside, but had an in-house generator
system.

There was a thermal seafloor vent where hot
water was pumped out of the seabed, and heat
from that was used to operate the generator.


158 :

{T2A190}
[£o¢o]
But why do you need to go there?


{T2A191}
[Tsugumi]
Because it's a pain with the lights off.


{T2A192}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


{T2A193}
[Tsugumi]
To make repairs.


{T2A194}
[Tsugumi]
"I think the cause of the blackout is the 
generator."


159 :

{T2A195}
[£o¢o]
Oh, I see!


{T2A196}
[£o¢o]
So that's why you need this big box?


{T2A197}
[Tsugumi]
Yes.


160 :

{T2A198}
[£o¢o]
Oh, I get it now... That makes sense.

Tsugumi was finally freed from £o¢o's barrage
of questions.


{T2A199}
[Tsugumi]
Alright. I'm going down...


161 :

{T2A200}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... could you come along?

[Takeshi]
Huh? Me?

Without thinking, I shot a question back at
her.


162 :
Her question was pretty sudden and caught me
off balance.

Besides, I thought that it was the first time
she had called me by my name.

[Takeshi]
"First, there is one thing that I want to ask 
you..."


{T2A201}
[Tsugumi]
What?

[Takeshi]
"You just said something about the emergency 
stairs not leading to the generator room, 
right?"

[Takeshi]
So... why's that?


{T2A202}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't you remember the map of LeMU that we 
saw yesterday?"

[Takeshi]
Map? Map... Map...

I pressed on my temples with my fingers,
trying to tease out a buried memory.


163 :

{T2A203}
[Tsugumi]
"The map of the third floor was divided into 
two areas."


{T2A204}
[Tsugumi]
Do you remember?

[Takeshi]
"I can't say I remember it exactly... but 
kinda, yeah."


{T2A205}
[Tsugumi]
And what was between those two areas?

[Takeshi]
Between them? How am I supposed to know...?

[Takeshi]
There wasn't anything there.


{T2A206}
[Tsugumi]
Exactly.


{T2A207}
[Tsugumi]
Which means?

[Takeshi]
"The two areas are divided by a block 
which is now underwater...?"


{T2A208}
[Tsugumi]
So?


164 :
[Takeshi]
"We can't move directly from the control room 
area to the generator room area."


{T2A209}
[Tsugumi]
So what?

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see...

[Takeshi]
"To get to the generator room's area, 
we have to access the second floor..."


165 :
[Takeshi]
"And the only way we can do that is by 
using the neutral buoyancy elevator."


{T2A210}
[Tsugumi]
Could you... help me out?

[Takeshi]
"But do you think it's alright? I mean, we 
haven't asked Sora's opinion..."

[Takeshi]
"And we don't know if the cause of the 
blackout is really the generator..."


166 :

{T2A211}
[Tsugumi]
I don't think that'd do any good.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T2A212}
[Tsugumi]
I don't think you're going to find Sora.


{T2A213}
[Tsugumi]
Because of the blackout...

[Takeshi]
?


167 :

{T2A214}
[Tsugumi]
"The control room computer is going to be 
down."


{T2A215}
[Tsugumi]
"Even if Sora were around, she wouldn't be 
able to contact LeMMIH."


{T2A216}
[Tsugumi]
"So the only thing that we can do is go check 
out the generator, right?"

[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose so, but...


168 :

{T2A217}
[Tsugumi]
So what're you going to do?


{T2A218}
[Tsugumi]
Will you come along?

[Takeshi]
.........


169 :

{T2A219}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


170 :

{T2A220}
[Tsugumi]
I really... need... you...

Those words shocked me. I thought my heart
stopped for a second.

'I really... need... you...'

They were not words that I ever expected to
hear from Tsugumi's mouth.

Tsugumi stared straight at me.

Her intense gaze made me uncomfortable.


{T2A221}
[Tsugumi]
Please...

171 :
{11:0-97}
{11:1}Help Tsugumi

{11:1}Look for Sora first


172 :
[Takeshi]
A-alright...

[Takeshi]
I'll go with you.

I stared back into Tsugumi's eyes.

I didn't think about going against her.

Tsugumi nodded.


173 :

{T2A222}
[£o¢o]
Hey, what about £o¢o?


174 :

{T2A223}
[Tsugumi]
I've got another job I want £o¢o to do.


{T2A224}
[£o¢o]
Another job? What's that?


{T2A225}
[Tsugumi]
"I want you to tell Y¤u and the Kid what I 
just told you."


{T2A226}
[Tsugumi]
"I mean, tell them that Takeshi and I are 
going to the generator room..."


{T2A227}
[£o¢o]
Oh, that.


175 :

{T2A228}
[£o¢o]
Roger! Ten-four that!

£o¢o clicked her heels together and gave a
kind of salute.


176 :
[Takeshi]
N-no...

[Takeshi]
I don't want to go.

I turned my face to avoid Tsugumi's eyes.

I didn't want her eyes to drag me in.

[Takeshi]
"We've got to look for Sora first. This isn't 
a time to be acting selfishly."


177 :

{T2A229}
[Tsugumi]
...I see.

Tsugumi frowned.

She gave me that look that could kill again.


178 :

{T2A230}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey. Do you want me to go instead?

£o¢o asked the question innocently.


179 :

{T2A231}
[Tsugumi]
Uh... Let's see...

Tsugumi's expression soon returned to normal.


{T2A232}
[Tsugumi]
"But I don't think it's possible with just 
you alone."


180 :

{T2A233}
[Tsugumi]
First, I want to ask you to do another job.


{T2A234}
[£o¢o]
Another job? What's that?


{T2A235}
[Tsugumi]
"I want you to tell Y¤u and the Kid that I'm 
going to the generator room."


181 :

{T2A236}
[Tsugumi]
"And... that Takeshi put me in a difficult spot 
because he was scared and wouldn't come along 
with me..."

[Takeshi]
Hey, hold on! When did I say I was scared?

I jumped in between £o¢o and Tsugumi.


182 :

{T2A237}
[Tsugumi]
"'No. I don't want to go.' That sounds pretty 
scared to me."

[Takeshi]
"Hey! Who do you think you're calling scared? 
I just think that we should do something else 
first."


183 :

{T2A238}
[Tsugumi]
"See what I mean. Something happens and you 
start whining like a baby..."


184 :

{T2A239}
[Tsugumi]
You are a gutless man...


185 :

{T2A240}
[Tsugumi]
Or maybe you're not even a man yet...?


{T2A241}
[Tsugumi]
"£o¢o, hurry and get Y¤u and the Kid. Takeshi 
isn't going to be any use."

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! You don't have to talk like that!

I was peeved.


186 :

{T2A242}
[Tsugumi]
So how do you want me to say it?

Without hesitating, Tsugumi shot the question
right back at me.

[Takeshi]
.........

For one moment, I thought I'd grab her by her
collar and show her.

But I dropped my hand...

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay. Fine. I'll go with you.

[Takeshi]
"I'll go with you because you are too scared 
to go alone."


187 :

{T2A243}
[Tsugumi]
...Hmmph.

Tsugumi laughed through her nose.


188 :

{T2A244}
[£o¢o]
So what am I supposed to do?


189 :

{T2A245}
[Tsugumi]
"...Just tell Y¤u that I'm going to the 
generator room."


{T2A246}
[Tsugumi]
And I'm taking Takeshi along.


190 :

{T2A247}
[£o¢o]
Roger! Ten-four that!


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

£o¢o clicked her heels together and gave a
kind of salute.
