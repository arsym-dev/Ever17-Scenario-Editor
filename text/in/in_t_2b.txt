1 :
‡LThe neutral buoyancy elevator 'Ei'.

'Ei' meant 'egg' in German.

It was also a literal take on the egg-shaped
elevator that traveled up and down rails into
the ocean on the side of LeMU.

A ballast tank was attached to the floor.

It would take in or release seawater from the
tank as necessary to increase or reduce
buoyancy, making the elevator rise
or sink.


2 :
Once Tsugumi and I were inside, we sealed the
watertight doors on the LeMU side of the
elevator.

All we had to do was release the lock
connecting us to LeMU, and the 'egg' would
sink away.


3 :
Tsugumi pulled the operating lever next to
the door.


4 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

Nothing happened.

[Takeshi]
What's going on? We're not sinking at all.


{T2B000}
[Tsugumi]
Doesn't look like it.


5 :
Tsugumi calmly opened up the toolbox she had
brought with her.

Inside were things like an electric screwdriver, hydraulic
cutting machine, some kind of laser or welding
device, a small gas burner...

The box was packed with any and all kinds of
tools.

[Takeshi]
Huh? What're you going to do... with that?


6 :

{T2B001}
[Tsugumi]
If it won't sink...


7 :

{T2B002}
[Tsugumi]
Then we'll just have to sink it.

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


8 :
[Takeshi]
What? Ts-Ts-Ts-Tsugumi! Are you crazy!?

Tsugumi took the lit torch in hand and slowly
stood up.

Blue flame erupted from it like a jet engine,
hissing in the dim light.

[Takeshi]
N-n-n-n-no way...

[Takeshi]
You're kidding, right? Tsugumi...

Tsugumi didn't answer.

She grinned triumphantly.


9 :
She put the flame to the edge of the
elevator's shell.

[Takeshi]
Yikes!

There was no time to stop her.


10 :
A coin-sized hole opened in the egg-shaped
elevator, and seawater came spurting in with
tremendous force.

[Takeshi]
You idiot! Idiot! Idiooot!

[Takeshi]
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what're you trying to do?

[Takeshi]
A hole! There's a hole!


{T2B003}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, I made it.

Tsugumi was as calm as ever.


11 :
She extinguished the flame as if nothing had
happened. She placed it in the toolbox and
shut the lid.

The seawater created a mist, descending all
around us.

Tsugumi licked the droplets off of her lips.

[Takeshi]
You're crazy, right!?

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, being cooped up in here's made you 
crazy!"


{T2B004}
[Tsugumi]
Heh heh heh...

Tsugumi just snickered.


12 :
As we continued that exchange, water
continued to pour in.

It pooled in the bottom of the egg.

It covered our ankles, then our shins,
swallowing our knees and then lapping at our
thighs.

I...

13 :
{11:0-99}
{11:1}Decided to escape

{11:1}Thought maybe I'd wash my hair


14 :
I decided it would be best to escape.

I didn't want to be around that crazy woman
anymore.

I discreetly reached for the handle of the
watertight door...


15 :

{T2B005}
[Tsugumi]
What are you doing...?


16 :

{T2B006}
[Tsugumi]
You said... you would come along with me...

Tsugumi grabbed my wrist.

Tsugumi's palm was soft and wet...

There was a soft suction-like feeling as she
grabbed me.


17 :
Tsugumi stared at me.

It was a serious, hard look.

[Takeshi]
F-fine, have it your way!

[Takeshi]
"I'll go along with you to the end! Even if 
we sink to the bottom of the ocean!"

I made up my mind.


18 :
I thought it was good timing. I was due for a
wash anyway.

I'd missed bathing the day before...

I dunked my head under the inflowing water and
mussed up my hair.

Yup. It was invigorating.

I could really feel the minerals seeping into
my scalp.

The water was cold, but it was actually
refreshing.

[Takeshi]
Hey, can you get the shampoo for me?

[Takeshi]
...Er, what the heck am I doing?


19 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi gave me the evil eye.


20 :
Just then...


21 :
Boom! The egg elevator took a big jolt and
started to move.


22 :
Ei began to descend ever so slowly...

Peeking through the window and into the
blue, we could see the outside of LeMU.

The blue gradually got darker, and the steel
bulkhead appeared to move farther away upward.


23 :
The higher water pressure increased the force
of the water pouring in.

The speed of our descent picked up.

I wondered how many meters we had dropped.

I shifted my gaze toward the sea bottom, but
Dritter Stock still hadn't come into view.

The water in the elevator had already reached
my chest.

My legs were floating... I was on my toes...


24 :
I kicked off the floor with all my power and
seized an edge of the ceiling.

[Takeshi]
H-hey...

[Takeshi]
Don't you think this is pretty dangerous?

A strained smile appeared on Tsugumi's face.

It seemed she was getting a little worried.

[Takeshi]
I wonder if... we'll die like this...


{T2B007}
[Tsugumi]
M-maybe...

[Takeshi]
No, not 'maybe'!

[Takeshi]
"This harebrained idea was all your... *cough*, 
*splutter*..."


25 :
The surface of the water reached my throat,
and cold seawater rushed into my mouth.

I lifted my chin and desperately tried to
stick to the ceiling.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

I screamed crazily.


26 :
I looked sideways and saw Tsugumi struggling
to stay above the water.

Just then...


27 :
Boom! The egg was shaken by a strong shock.


28 :
'We made it to the third floor!'

I wanted to shout that, but it was impossible.

There was no longer enough air for me to yell.

I didn't know if she had panicked or what, but
Tsugumi was thrashing her arms and legs around
desperately.

In the blur underwater... I pinned down
Tsugumi's shoulder.

'It's alright. I'll take care of it.'

I felt Tsugumi's body relax.


29 :
I kicked against the wall and clung to the
handle of the watertight door.


30 :
I focused every bit of strength in my body
on turning the heavy handle...

Because my body would float, I couldn't gain
traction with my feet.


31 :
Bracing one leg on the handrail, I continued
turning and turning it...

The water pressure began pressing in on my
eardrums.

My body was screaming for oxygen.


32 :
Open!

Open!!

Ooppppppeeeeeeeen!!!


33 :
The double-ply door opened.

The mass of water, Tsugumi, and I were all
spit out of the elevator and onto the floor.

But we didn't have time to catch our breath.


34 :
Seawater was flooding into the hole in the
elevator more ferociously than ever.

I got up immediately and rushed to the
watertight door on the elevator.

First, I closed that door, locked it, and then
closed the door on the LeMU side as well.


35 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

For a while, I couldn't move.


36 :
Tsugumi was sprawled out on the floor too.

I didn't feel angry with her.

Because relief was the dominant emotion...


(That was such a stupid thing to do...)

(What if we really had died...?)

Tsugumi was coughing a little, looking down.

She didn't try to look at me.

I thought that maybe she was reflecting on
what she had done.


37 :
(That's it, maybe...)

(Maybe she just isn't a 'people person' and
has a hard time getting along with others...)


She seemed fragile and lonely...

Maybe she needed someone's help...?

It was the first time that I had realized
there was anything weak about her.

Sitting all alone in the middle of that
sprawling floor, she looked small, like a
newborn chick.


38 :
The hallway was dark.

The darkness hid our surroundings from us and
felt oppressive.

I walked slowly forward, making sure of each
step.

In my right hand, I had a huge toolbox... It
was so heavy that it felt like my shoulder might
break under its strain.

[Takeshi]
"I wonder if this area is full of water from 
yesterday's flooding."

Tsugumi shot a question back at me.


39 :

{T2B008}
[Tsugumi]
So what?

Two syllables... that was all she said.

[Takeshi]
What's your problem anyway?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Just a minute ago you were desperately 
screaming for help to keep from drowning."


40 :

{T2B009}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't scream anything.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, but your eyes did.


{T2B010}
[Tsugumi]
Did not.

[Takeshi]
There you go, acting all tough again.


{T2B011}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not acting tough.


{T2B012}
[Tsugumi]
Besides...


41 :
Bump.


42 :
[Takeshi]
"Ouch. Don't just stop all of a sudden like 
that."

[Takeshi]
It's dark and I can't see.


43 :

{T2B013}
[Tsugumi]
"Listen up. I'll only tell you once more. I 
never, ever asked for help."

Tsugumi turned back to me.

Shrouded in the darkness, I couldn't really
make out her expression.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, but if I hadn't opened up that door, the 
chances are you and I would both be floating 
drowned in that egg."


{T2B014}
[Tsugumi]
"If I have to be saved by you, then I'd 
rather die."

[Takeshi]
Oh reeeallly...


44 :
(Geez... Why can't this girl ever be honest with
people?)

I went around Tsugumi and walked farther
along the flooded corridor.

[Takeshi]
"One more thing I wanna get off my chest: 
what were those words all about anyway?"


{T2B015}
[Tsugumi]
What words?


45 :
As she fired another short question at me,
Tsugumi passed me again.

[Takeshi]
"What you said before we got in the 'egg' on 
the second floor."

[Takeshi]
'I really... really need you!'

[Takeshi]
"Your eyes were watery. You were begging me, 
right?"


46 :

{T2B016}
[Tsugumi]
Yes. I did.

(Oh. That was an unexpected answer...)


{T2B017}
[Tsugumi]
What about it?

[Takeshi]
S-s-so you are depending on me after all.

[Takeshi]
And now you finally admit it?

[Tsugumi]
.........


47 :
Tsugumi continued forward without talking...

[Takeshi]
"In other words, IF something were to happen, 
you want to be with someone you can rely on."

[Takeshi]
"You're afraid to be alone. That's why you 
wanted me to come."


48 :

{T2B018}
[Tsugumi]
You...


49 :

{T2B019}
[Tsugumi]
...Are SUCH an idiot.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T2B020}
[Tsugumi]
Don't you get it yet?

[Takeshi]
...?


50 :

{T2B021}
[Tsugumi]
"That Ei elevator is a neutral buoyancy 
elevator, so for the most part, it doesn't 
require outside power."


{T2B022}
[Tsugumi]
"But it does need power for the intake and 
release of water from the ballast tank... In 
fact, that's the only time it needs power."


{T2B023}
[Tsugumi]
And since this is a blackout...

[Takeshi]
"You couldn't operate the ballast 
valve... that much I know."


{T2B024}
[Tsugumi]
Well, do you know the Archimedes principle?

51 :
{11:0-9b}
{11:1}I know it

{11:1}I don't know it


52 :
[Takeshi]
Dang, you're annoying...

[Takeshi]
Of course I know about that.

[Takeshi]
"The buoyancy of a submerged object is equal 
to the weight of the liquid displaced by the 
object."

[Takeshi]
"And what does that have to do with what we're 
talking about?"


53 :
[Takeshi]
Nah. Can't say I understand that.

[Takeshi]
"I remember hearing about it a long time ago 
at school... but I forget."


{T2B025}
[Tsugumi]
"The buoyancy of a submerged object is equal 
to the weight of the liquid displaced by the 
object."

[Takeshi]
"Oh, you mean that. That's the Archimedes 
principle?"

[Takeshi]
And? What's that got to do with this...?


54 :

{T2B026}
[Tsugumi]
How about you figure the rest out yourself?


55 :
There she went again...

She would tease me along... but that was it...

[Takeshi]
Hmmm...

I gave a deep sigh and shook my head.


56 :
I switched the heavy toolbox to my other hand
and continued walking.

After walking a while, Tsugumi turned right
ahead of me.

I followed after her.


57 :
[Takeshi]
Oh!

Turning the corner, it finally hit me.

[Takeshi]
I see... So that's what you meant...

[Takeshi]
I thought it was weird, you inviting me along.


58 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"To sink that egg elevator to the third floor, 
its total weight had to be greater than the 
force of the buoyancy."

[Takeshi]
"So just one skinny girl like you wasn't 
going to be enough weight."


59 :

{T2B027}
[Tsugumi]
Right.


{T2B028}
[Tsugumi]
So don't get me wrong.


{T2B029}
[Tsugumi]
"Of the five people trapped here, you're the 
heaviest, right?"

[Takeshi]
"Y-you... I'm not just some big rock 
paperweight!"


60 :

{T2B030}
[Tsugumi]
No. You're more than a rock...


{T2B031}
[Tsugumi]
You're a rock head.


61 :
As I was thinking of a comeback to 'rock head',
we arrived at our destination.

Dim yellow and black stripes appeared
ahead.

[Takeshi]
This is it? This is the generator room...?

I tried bringing my face close to the plate on
the door, but it was too dark to read.

[Takeshi]
I'll take a look.

I reached toward the door handle...


62 :

{T2B032}
[Tsugumi]
Wait!

Tsugumi grabbed my arm.

[Takeshi]
Huh? What's up?


63 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
What?


64 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
If you don't talk, I don't understand.

Tsugumi held my arm firmly.

The wet palm of her hand felt cool.

I didn't know what she wanted to say. I tried
to read something from her expression, but it
was too dark to see.


65 :

{T2B033}
[Tsugumi]
I don't think you should open it...

[Takeshi]
Why not?


{T2B034}
[Tsugumi]
It's dangerous... maybe...

[Takeshi]
Dangerous? Inside this room?


66 :
Tsugumi nodded and gently removed her hand
from my arm.


67 :
And then she quietly approached the door.

She tossed some of the water droplets from
her hand at the steel door.


68 :
The droplets sizzled on the door, evaporating
away.

[Takeshi]
Is there a fire or something inside?

Tsugumi shook her head.


69 :

{T2B035}
[Tsugumi]
"The generator uses hot water, so I don't 
think it could be a fire."

[Takeshi]
Then...


70 :

{T2B036}
[Tsugumi]
It's probably steam...


{T2B037}
[Tsugumi]
"I think it's just packed full of extremely 
hot steam."

[Takeshi]
.........


71 :

{T2B038}
[Tsugumi]
"This generator is designed to operate 
normally at six atmospheres."


{T2B039}
[Tsugumi]
"But right now, LeMU's air pressure is at one 
atmosphere."


{T2B040}
[Tsugumi]
"There is a possibility that a tank or pipe 
filled with high-pressure steam could have 
ruptured."


{T2B041}
[Tsugumi]
"Or that some abnormality was detected and 
triggered a safety valve to be opened..."

[Takeshi]
Oh, I get it.

[Takeshi]
"Either way, steam is leaking from somewhere, 
and there isn't enough power to turn the 
turbine..."

[Takeshi]
And so the generator stopped.

[Takeshi]
If that is what happened...

[Takeshi]
"...Then that could've been pretty 
dangerous..."


72 :
The instant I opened the door, my whole body
would have been showered with several
hundred-degree steam...

Like Tsugumi, I tossed some water on the door.


73 :
Fwishhhhhh!


74 :
After that...

Tsugumi and I made for the room next door to
the generator room.

We were implementing Tsugumi's plan: 'First,
shut off the hot water flowing to the
generator room'.


75 :
It was dark, and I couldn't see everything,
but the room was covered in an astounding
network of pipes.

The pipes continued into the generator room
next door. It seemed that opening and closing
the valves could adjust the water and oil
pressure.

'Normally, LeMMIH is responsible for
maintaining the generator room, but even
LeMMIH can't do much when the generator
itself goes out.'

'Anyhow, this is all because the power supply
is down.'

'The room is designed so that maintenance
can be performed manually at times like this,
or during blackouts.'

...That was what Tsugumi told me.

(Why does Tsugumi know so much about LeMU?)


(She seemed to know where the generator room
and the room with all of the pipes was...)

Those doubts nagged at my mind.

As I was thinking, Tsugumi
plugged away next to me.

Tsugumi selected one pipe from the countless
rows of them and closed its valve.

I had no idea which pipe was doing what.


But Tsugumi knew.

(What kind of girl is Tsugumi anyway...?)

I still hadn't found out how she had known
that the inside of the generator room was
'dangerous'.

(I wonder if Tsugumi has some kind of
connection with LeMU...)


76 :

{T2B042}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmph...


{T2B043}
[Tsugumi]
I think this should do it.


77 :
As soon as the work was done, Tsugumi left.


I was left alone in the room...

There were still a number of nagging doubts
that I hadn't resolved.


78 :
With that, we had been able to shut off the
hot water flowing to the generator room.

Even so, on the other side of the door, it
was still hot enough to scald.

Tsugumi and I waited in front of the
generator room until the temperature inside
had cooled down sufficiently.

We sat on the water-covered floor and leaned
against the wall.

We sat next to each other.

We were both already drenched, so we didn't
have any problem with sitting in water.

Besides, the water was warmer than it
looked...

I thought it was probably the heat from the
generator room.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, how long do you think we're gonna have 
to wait?"

I asked Tsugumi that.


79 :
[Takeshi]
An hour?

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi didn't even try to answer.

It was so dark that I couldn't even tell if
she had nodded or shaken her head.


80 :
In the darkness, there were intermittent and
repeated clicking noises.

It was like the sound of dry plastic
crinkling, like on the top of a champagne
bottle.


81 :
It sounded like it was coming from near
Tsugumi's hands.

[Takeshi]
What's that?


82 :

{T2B044}
[Tsugumi]
...What?

[Takeshi]
That crackly sound you're making?


83 :
The sound stopped.

Tsugumi took whatever it was and put it away
in her pocket.

I thought it might be her way of saying 'I'm
not going to tell'.

[Takeshi]
"What is it with you? You only answer when 
you feel like it?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
You're like a cat.


84 :

{T2B045}
[Tsugumi]
I hate cats.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T2B046}
[Tsugumi]
Because they eat mice.

[Takeshi]
"I don't have a clue what you're talking 
about."


85 :

{T2B047}
[Tsugumi]
I...


{T2B048}
[Tsugumi]
...I'm not a cat.

[Takeshi]
That's for sure!


86 :

{T2B049}
[Tsugumi]
My answering has nothing to do with my mood.


{T2B050}
[Tsugumi]
"If a question has meaning, I answer. If it 
doesn't, I don't... That's all."

[Takeshi]
Really?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
So you are serious.


87 :

{T2B051}
[Tsugumi]
"So that's the kind of question I don't want 
to answer."


{T2B052}
[Tsugumi]
A question to check something...


{T2B053}
[Tsugumi]
"A question about something you don't need to 
know..."


{T2B054}
[Tsugumi]
"Or questions about things that you know I 
don't know, but you ask anyway..."


88 :

{T2B055}
[Tsugumi]
"There is more than enough pointless 
conversation in the world... don't you 
think?"

[Takeshi]
Alright. I got it already.

[Takeshi]
How about I ask you a meaningful question?

I wanted to ask...

89 :
{11:0-9d}
{11:1}About the air pressure of the generator room

{11:1}Why she knew so much about LeMU


90 :
There was something that had been bugging me.


So I decided to take the opportunity and ask
about it.

[Takeshi]
"It's about the air pressure of the generator 
room..."

[Takeshi]
"A while ago, until you closed that valve, 
really hot water was being pumped in, right?"

[Takeshi]
"And that water turns to steam, and it gets 
more and more packed in there."

[Takeshi]
"What's more, it's steam at a temperature of 
several hundred degrees."

[Takeshi]
"So that means that the air pressure in the 
room is just getting higher."

[Takeshi]
"For example, it's like if you poured a bunch 
of water into a kettle, welded it shut, 
blocked the spout, and put it on a fire."

[Takeshi]
"Then, finally, it would go and explode with a 'boom', 
right?"

[Takeshi]
But somehow... the generator room is fine.


{T2B056}
[Tsugumi]
And?

[Takeshi]
Uh, I mean, why is that...?


91 :

{T2B057}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...


{T2B058}
[Tsugumi]
"Is that what you call a 'meaningful 
question'?"

[Takeshi]
"You bet. Because it's a matter of life and 
death."


92 :

{T2B059}
[Tsugumi]
Hmph...


{T2B060}
[Tsugumi]
"It sounds to me like a typical stupid 
question... but whatever."


{T2B061}
[Tsugumi]
"First, you have to think about when the 
generator was functioning normally."


{T2B062}
[Tsugumi]
"At that time, steam would spout on and off 
and turn the turbine."


{T2B063}
[Tsugumi]
"Where would the steam usually go once it was 
used...?"


{T2B064}
[Tsugumi]
I think it was probably sent outside of LeMU.


{T2B065}
[Tsugumi]
"In other words, the kettle's spout wasn't 
plugged."


93 :
[Takeshi]
Hoho, I see.

[Takeshi]
"So the generator room is connected to the 
outside by a pipe or something."

Hmmmm...

I nodded to myself.


94 :
I decided to ask about something that had been
nagging me for a while.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, why do you know so much about LeMU?

[Takeshi]
"I mean, you seem to know a bunch of details, like about this Generator Room or 
the pipe room or whatever."

[Tsugumi]
.........

I couldn't check her expression, but it
seemed like she was deep in thought about
something.

[Takeshi]
How's that for a meaningful question?


95 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


{T2B066}
[Tsugumi]
Completely...


96 :

{T2B067}
[Tsugumi]
...Devoid of meaning.

Tsugumi muttered that.


97 :

{T2B068}
[Tsugumi]
How is my answer to that going to help you?


{T2B069}
[Tsugumi]
"It doesn't really matter whether you know 
about me or not."


{T2B070}
[Tsugumi]
It's something you don't need to know...

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.

[Takeshi]
If you don't wanna tell me, that's fine.


98 :
Still, I really did want to know.

Tsugumi's evasion of the question had made me
interested in finding out what there really
was to her.

But I didn't think that she would answer if I
badgered her about it anymore.

I was irritated, but decided to play
it cool and pretend like I didn't care.


99 :
Then...


100 :

{T2B071}
[Tsugumi]
Hey.

I didn't know what she was thinking, but
Tsugumi suddenly put her face in front of mine.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what?


{T2B072}
[Tsugumi]
Now it's my turn.

[Takeshi]
...Y-yeah?


{T2B073}
[Tsugumi]
Can I ask you a question?

[Takeshi]
Uh, sure... Go ahead...


101 :

{T2B074}
[Tsugumi]
Will you close... your eyes?

[Takeshi]
... Is... that the question?


102 :

{T2B075}
[Tsugumi]
It's more of a favor.

There in the darkness...

In that narrow corridor...

Just a few centimeters from my nose...

The two of us...

My mind turned to steam and evaporated.


{T2B076}
[Tsugumi]
Are they closed?

Almost as if I were hypnotized, my eyes began
to sink.


103 :
And immediately after that...


104 :
‡LShake, shake, shake!


105 :
‡LSplish, splash!


106 :
‡LSlosh, slosh, slosh, slosh, slosh!


107 :
Click!

I didn't know what to make of those noises.

I opened my eyes without thinking...


108 :
Tsugumi was grinning mischievously right in
front of me.


{T2B077}
[Tsugumi]
Close them!

She covered my eyes with one hand.


109 :
And then...


110 :
Fwwwiiiiiiiiish!

[Takeshi]
Hey, hey, what're you doing!?


{T2B078}
[Tsugumi]
You jerk! You dumb jerk!

I screamed.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you doing?


111 :
Some kind of spray showered my face.


[Takeshi]
You... You... That went in my mouth...


112 :

{T2B079}
[Tsugumi]
Take that! You loser!

[Takeshi]
Stop it! Stop it! What's the matter with you...?


113 :
I desperately tried to resist, but my body
wouldn't obey me.

Tsugumi had me by the neck.


114 :

{T2B080}
[Tsugumi]
How's that, you slug!?


{T2B081}
[Tsugumi]
You scum on the pond of life!


115 :
With those words, the eruption in my face
stopped.

[Takeshi]
My mwouth... iz nwumb... Whaddya spway won me...


{T2B082}
[Tsugumi]
Heeheehee...

I thought she was laughing, but the next
thing I knew, Tsugumi had started rubbing my
face with a cloth.

It was rough, and her technique didn't make it any
better...

[Takeshi]
Ohhhh... Ahhhh...

I stopped my futile resistance.

I was almost choking.

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T2B083}
[Tsugumi]
That's... just about right...

Tsugumi took her hand off of my neck.


116 :
Unable to open my eyes, I scooped up seawater
from the floor and put it in my mouth.

It was salty, but I didn't have any other
choice.


117 :
[Takeshi]
*Swish*, *swish*, *swish*, *swish*, *swish*...


118 :
[Takeshi]
Blah!


{T2B084}
[Tsugumi]
H-hey!


{T2B085}
[Tsugumi]
"That's dirty, so don't go spitting it over 
here!"

[Takeshi]
You! You! Yoooooou!

I wanted to say something to her, but washing
my face took priority.


119 :
I scooped more water, splashed it on my face,
and gargled again.

I opened my eyes.


120 :
[Takeshi]
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat do you think you're doing!?

[Takeshi]
What did you put on my face?


121 :

{T2B086}
[Tsugumi]
Acetone.

[Takeshi]
"Oh GREAT! I'm so HAPPY it wasn't some 
pesticide."

[Takeshi]
"You think I'm serious? You idiot! I'm 
not!"

[Takeshi]
"Whaddya doing, spraying that on me all of a 
sudden!?"


{T2B087}
[Tsugumi]
It was hard to look at.

[Takeshi]
Huh? What was?


{T2B088}
[Tsugumi]
Your face.

[Takeshi]
Whose?


{T2B089}
[Tsugumi]
Yours.

[Takeshi]
Y-y-y-y-you...

And then I realized something.

I remembered...

The black ink that had been on the palms of my
hands...

[Takeshi]
I see...

[Takeshi]
It was the graffiti...

[Takeshi]
It was still there...?

[Takeshi]
You erased all of it...

I had completely forgotten about it until
just then.

When I had been making sandwiches, looking for
Sora, and coming there, the writing had been on
my face the entire time.

[Takeshi]
And the acetone...

[Takeshi]
"Acetone... That's supposed to be like nail polish 
remover, right?"


122 :

{T2B090}
[Tsugumi]
I found it... in the toolbox...

There was a strong stench from it in the air.

It stung my nose like overripe fruit...

It smelled like a hangover.

[Takeshi]
Th-thanks.

I thanked her...

[Takeshi]
So what did the writing say?

I asked her about the graffiti.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


123 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


124 :

{T2B091}
[Tsugumi]
"You can wait if you want, but I'm not 
answering."


{T2B092}
[Tsugumi]
Because it's a meaningless question.


125 :
In the end, I never found out why she had
called me a slug.


126 :
We waited for the generator room to cool
before going in.

The heat inside must have defied imagination.

The air in the steam-filled room was heavy
and stuck to the skin.

Inhaling felt like swallowing globs of sticky
hot steam.

I was opening and closing my mouth like a
fish out of water.

[Takeshi]
Isn't it hard to breathe?

Tsugumi seemed to have ruled that question of
mine meaningless as well.

She completely ignored me as she started
working to get the generator up and running
again.


127 :
We did the work together.

Tsugumi gave commands, and I followed them.

I did the grunt work... tightening bolts,
loosening valves, and working on the pipes.


And when I finished tightening the last
bolt...


128 :
[Takeshi]
Whew. That should do it.

I wiped my sweat away with my collar.

It was just like Tsugumi had said. The
blackout had been caused when the safety valve had
opened due to the drop in air pressure.

'When pressure from the steam becomes
excessive, the valve automatically opens to
release the gas and prevent damage.'

'Normally, after a release of surplus gas, the
valve is designed to shut automatically... but
we're at one atmosphere, so...'

'Because the safety valve never closed, the
steam continued leaking.'

...Anyway, that was the gist of the
explanation.


129 :
Tsugumi and I went to the generator room and
then to the pipe room...


130 :
There, we opened the valve we had closed
before the repairs...


131 :
And returned to the generator room.

[Takeshi]
So should we try to fire it up?


132 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
I'm turning it on.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
You ready?

[Tsugumi]
.........


133 :
[Takeshi]
Let's start the countdown...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
30 seconds...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
25 seconds...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
20... 19... 18... 17...


134 :
‡LClick.

Tsugumi pushed the button.


135 :
[Takeshi]
"Hey! What are you doing!? We still had seventeen 
seconds to go!"


136 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"You can't wait a little more than a mere thirteen 
seconds?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"This... This is kind of like a 
ritual... Anyway, it's very important..."


137 :

{T2B093}
[Tsugumi]
Zero...

The lights lit up all at once.

The light poured down, illuminating even the
corners of the room.

It was like our field of vision had expanded
in an instant.


138 :

{T2B094}
[Tsugumi]
"See... It took exactly seventeen seconds for the 
lights to come on..."


139 :
Tsugumi flashed me a condescending glance and
strolled out of the room.

[Takeshi]
Tsk.

I shouldered the weighty toolbox and followed
after Tsugumi.


140 :
We found ourselves back in front of the
neutral buoyancy elevator.

Tsugumi was waiting with her arms crossed.


141 :

{T2B095}
[Tsugumi]
You're slow.

[Takeshi]
"Whaddya expect? I'm the one carrying this 
leaden toolbox!"


{T2B096}
[Tsugumi]
I know.

(Oh yeah...)

(I forgot it was Tsugumi who took the
toolbox out of the warehouse...)

As I recalled that, I turned my eyes to the
egg-like elevator.

On the other side of that door, the egg that
we came in should have been waiting.

It was an egg with a hole in it. It was
useless to us.

To the left...

The floor display was lit up with a number
three.

[Takeshi]
"Did you know there was another egg elevator 
stopped down here...?"


{T2B097}
[Tsugumi]
Wouldn't have come if I didn't.

[Takeshi]
I suppose not...


142 :
[Takeshi]
Oh, this is heavy.


143 :
Inside the egg elevator, I put the toolbox on
the floor.


144 :

{T2B098}
[Tsugumi]
You sound like an old man...

[Takeshi]
Shut up. I AM an old man compared to you.


145 :
As I said that, I pushed the up button next
to the elevator door.

The internal and external watertight doors had
already sealed automatically.


146 :
We could hear air being sent into the ballast
tank under the floor.

Finally, the egg-shaped elevator...

...Didn't start to float up.


147 :
[Takeshi]
Huh? Are you serious?

The sound beneath the floor had stopped, and
silence had returned.

[Takeshi]
Not again...

[Takeshi]
"Why do we keep running into problem after 
problem...?"


148 :
Knowing it was useless, I pushed
the up button repeatedly.


149 :
Tsugumi was as matter-of-fact as always...

She was playing with and coiling her long,
still-damp hair with her finger.


150 :
[Takeshi]
Alright, so what do we do...?

Just as I said that...


151 :
A monitor just to the right of the round
window flickered to life.


152 :

{T2B099}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, Komachi-san.

[Takeshi]
"Sora! Where have you been? We looked 
everywhere for you!"


{T2B100}
[Sora]
"I am terribly sorry. Please accept my 
apologies."

The image of Sora in the monitor bowed deeply.

[Takeshi]
That's not important right now.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi and I fixed the generator.


{T2B101}
[Sora]
It would appear so.


{T2B102}
[Sora]
Thank you so much. Thank you...

[Takeshi]
"I think you know this, but we're in this 
egg... Uh, this Ei..."


{T2B103}
[Sora]
Yes, I know.


{T2B104}
[Sora]
The Ei is not moving, correct?

[Takeshi]
What should we do?


{T2B105}
[Sora]
First, in regard to the cause...


{T2B106}
[Sora]
"It is likely the result of a decrease in 
internal air pressure that has made the 
device incapable of sufficiently expelling 
the seawater in the ballast tank."


{T2B107}
[Sora]
In other words...

[Takeshi]
You mean it isn't buoyant enough?


{T2B108}
[Sora]
Correct.


{T2B109}
[Sora]
"There are a number of feasible methods for 
making it rise, but..."

It was then that Tsugumi acted.


153 :
She suddenly opened the watertight door.

[Takeshi]
H-hey! Wait! Whaddya think you're doing?


154 :
Without answering, Tsugumi also opened the
LeMU side door.


155 :

{T2B110}
[Tsugumi]
Okay then...

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Tsugumi tried to get out of the elevator...

I grabbed her arm, trying to stop her.


156 :

{T2B111}
[Tsugumi]
Don't touch me!


157 :
‡LWhack!

An immediate, brutal slap...


158 :

{T2B112}
[Tsugumi]
I told you... don't touch me...

My cheek didn't hurt.


159 :
I absently watched Tsugumi return to the floor.


160 :

{T2B113}
[Announcement]
<Anfang.>

The egg quietly started to ascend.

I could no longer see her on the other side
of the door.


{T2B114}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 50 meter.>


{T2B115}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 45 meter.>


{T2B116}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 40 meter.>

The recorded announcement echoed with a tinny
sound.


161 :
[Takeshi]
Oh no! Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

When I met everyone on Zweiter Stock, they
greeted me with friendly shouts.


{T2B117}
[Kid]
What happened... to Tsugumi?

[Takeshi]
"That idiot decided to stay alone on the floor 
below..."


{T2B118}
[Y¤u]
It sure looks like it.

[Takeshi]
No, it doesn't 'look like it'‡Lshe did!

[Takeshi]
She's all alone down there!

[Takeshi]
Aren't you worried about her?


{T2B119}
[£o¢o]
But...

[Takeshi]
I'm going back down!

[Takeshi]
I'm going down and I'm bringing Tsugumi back!


{T2B120}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
We can't leave Tsugumi alone down there!

[Takeshi]
"Look... She's... really not as tough as she 
acts..."

[Takeshi]
Somebody... has to be with her...


{T2B121}
[Kid]
Hmmm...


{T2B122}
[£o¢o]
Wow...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, what are you doing!? Get your act 
together!"

[Takeshi]
"Tsugumi can be a bit of an ass, but that 
doesn't mean you have to be so cold to her!"

[Takeshi]
Enough!

[Takeshi]
Anyway, I'm going back for her!

With that, I went back to the entrance to the
egg and waited in front of the doors.

Next...


162 :
When the doors opened...


163 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


164 :

{T2B123}
[Tsugumi]
Uh...


{T2B124}
[Tsugumi]
Will you move?


165 :

{T2B125}
[Tsugumi]
You're in my way.

I simply stood there...


166 :
Tsugumi pushed me out of the way and walked by.


167 :
If there were a rock there, I would have
crawled under it.

So I did the next closest thing I could think
of.


{T2B126}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 35 meter.>


{T2B127}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 40 meter.>


{T2B128}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 45 meter.>

I went back down to Dritter Stock in the egg
for no reason.

(It didn't have enough buoyancy, so we had to
come up one by one...)

(Was I stupid or what...?)

If I could have, right then, I would have
liked to sink down to the bottom of the ocean.
