1 :
We met at the tuna sandwich stand and ate
as scheduled.

In the end, I didn't fix anything for dinner...


2 :

{T3C000}
[Kid]
Hey, Takeshi.

[Takeshi]
Whaaaat?


{T3C001}
[Kid]
"Can't you make anything besides tuna 
sandwiches?"

[Takeshi]
"Hmm, well, there's not much I can do 'bout 
that..."

[Takeshi]
"There wasn't much at this kiosk except 
tuna sandwiches to start with."

[Takeshi]
"I cooked all the hotdogs this morning, so 
they're finished. The owner probably just 
kept them for a little variation."


3 :

{T3C002}
[Kid]
Oh really...

The Kid held the sandwich wrapping in his
right hand and twisted it around his
fingertip.

The half-eaten sandwich remained in his left
hand, not getting any smaller.

It didn't seem like he couldn't finish it...


4 :

{T3C003}
[Y工]
What's the deal? Eat up before it gets cold.

Y工 was done eating, and she peered at the
Kid's face.


{T3C004}
[Kid]
Yeah...


5 :

{T3C005}
[Y工]
"You must have walked all over looking for 
something else to eat. But it was no use 
after all, huh?"


{T3C006}
[Y工]
"The food that washed into the corridors during the 
flooding is almost all spoiled anyway..."


6 :

{T3C007}
[Y工]
"But that's okay, because we've got more stuff to 
make tuna sandwiches than you could 
imagine."


7 :

{T3C008}
[Kid]
I guess that's true...

The Kid tore off a piece of the sandwich and
shoved it in his mouth.


{T3C009}
[Y工]
"To survive, it's crucial that you have 
something you can eat."

[Takeshi]
Hey, it looks like he got the picture.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, looks like we've got a real survivor 
on our hands."


8 :

{T3C010}
[Y工]
Yep, that's right.

Y工 answered shortly.


9 :
[Takeshi]
...Huh?


{T3C011}
[Y工]
"Yeah, just a little hobby of mine. Sometimes, 
I go into the mountains alone."


{T3C012}
[Y工]
"I carve my own path... Sometimes, I even get a 
bit lost..."


10 :
[Takeshi]
Into the mountains alone?

[Takeshi]
"What, are you training in some ancient fighting 
art on the sly!?"


11 :

{T3C013}
[Y工]
"Geez, Kuranari. Why do you have to get like 
that?"

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, out fighting the black bears under the 
winter moon!"


12 :

{T3C014}
[Y工]
"Nope. I hunt out hot springs that nobody 
knows about."


13 :

{T3C015}
[Y工]
"Yeah, deep in the mountains, someplace no 
one else has ever been. Oh, now THAT is this 
girl's idea of romantic!"

Y工 wriggled as if intoxicated by the image.

[Takeshi]
"Oh, now I get it. You were soaking in the hot 
springs with a bear."


14 :

{T3C016}
[Y工]
"No, no, no. Would you shut up about bears 
already..."

[Takeshi]
Heh heh...

[Takeshi]
"So despite appearances, you're really wild 
at heart."


15 :

{T3C017}
[Y工]
"Oh, what might you be suggesting? Oh, heh 
heh~"

Y工 drew herself up in an exaggerated fashion.

[Takeshi]
"Oh yeah, you talked about stitching up your 
own finger. I suppose that was also while you 
were out searching for hot springs?"


16 :

{T3C018}
[Y工]
Huh? Oh... Yeah... I suppose.


{T3C019}
[Y工]
"But it was just a surface scratch, and I only 
needed a few stitches."

[Takeshi]
Hmph.

[Takeshi]
Just like I thought, bear wrestling.


17 :

{T3C020}
[Y工]
Just give it up!

Y工 turned red-faced as she exploded.

[Takeshi]
Weeheehee...


18 :

{T3C021}
[Y工]
Aaagghhh... I can't take this anymore.

[Y工]
.........


19 :
Y工 let out a sigh and turned away from me.


I supposed she was fed up.

(Maybe I got a little carried away...?)


20 :
But Y工's face clouded over a bit.

(Teasing her could have gotten her THAT
down...?)

Just as I was thinking that, Y工 avoided my
eyes and muttered...


21 :

{T3C022}
[Y工]
Hey, Kuranari...?


{T3C023}
[Y工]
Umm, about Tsugumi...

It seemed like she wanted to say something,
but she didn't know what to say.

[Takeshi]
What's up? What is it?


{T3C024}
[Y工]
Um, what I mean is, uh...


22 :
Just then, we heard the sounds of people
running through the water toward us.


23 :
Splish, splash, splish...


24 :

{T3C025}
[υ▊]
Hey, what's up?


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!

[Takeshi]
Hey, υ▊, you about ready to eat?


{T3C026}
[υ▊]
"Yeah, all that running around's made me 
starved!"


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*


25 :
That's right, I remembered she was the only
one who hadn't eaten yet.

I handed υ▊ the last tuna sandwich I had
kept in the food warmer.


26 :

{T3C027}
[υ▊]
Alright, time to eat~


27 :

{T3C028}
[υ▊]
Yay! Chow time!

[υ▊]
.........


28 :

{T3C029}
[υ▊]
Oh, this is yummy~


{T3C030}
[υ▊]
"Mmm. This blend of soy sauce, mayonnaise, and 
fried tuna is perfect. Yum. Supreme~"


29 :

{T3C031}
[υ▊]
Yeah, Kiddo. This is divine, isn't it?

υ▊ shot the question to the Kid, who was
standing in front of the store.


30 :

{T3C032}
[Kid]
Uh, yeah. Sure.


{T3C033}
[Kid]
But I'm getting a little tired of it.

A last bit of unfinished sandwich remained in
his left hand.


31 :

{T3C034}
[υ▊]
Really?


{T3C035}
[υ▊]
Put some of this on, it'll be even better.


32 :

{T3C036}
[Kid]
Huh? What is that?


33 :

{T3C037}
[υ▊]
Here it comes, ooey-gooey~

υ▊ pulled out a tube she had hidden behind
her back, held it over the Kid's sandwich, and
squeezed.

[Takeshi]
υ▊, what the heck is that?


34 :

{T3C038}
[υ▊]
Sour cream!


{T3C039}
[υ▊]
"It's supposed to be for salads. It was the 
last one at the gift shop."

[Takeshi]
Hmmmmm...

The tube said 'Add some spice to your life'
and 'Crab-flavored cream sauce: mild'.

[Takeshi]
"That could really broaden your culinary 
horizons."


35 :

{T3C040}
[υ▊]
Yep. *Munch*, *munch*...

She doused her sandwich with the sour cream,
opened her mouth wide, and shoved it in.


36 :

{T3C041}
[υ▊]
Delicious~


{T3C042}
[υ▊]
It doesn't get any better than this~


37 :
[Kid]
.........

The Kid looked at her doubtfully before
taking a bite.


38 :

{T3C043}
[Kid]
Hmmm... Not bad.


39 :

{T3C044}
[Kid]
This might be what it needed.


40 :

{T3C045}
[υ▊]
I told you! Yummy, yummy!


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

With that, both υ▊ and the Kid covered their
sandwiches with cream before polishing them
off.


41 :

{T3C046}
[υ▊]
Hey, hey, Takepyon.

υ▊ called out while crumpling up her
sandwich wrapping.

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T3C047}
[υ▊]
What're we gonna do with Tsugumin's sandwich?


{T3C048}
[υ▊]
How's about I hold onto it for her?

[Takeshi]
Uh, well...

I had made it for her and stuck it in
the warmer to keep for her.

But then again...


42 :

{T3C049}
[Y工]
Sorry, υ▊.


43 :

{T3C050}
[Y工]
"Tsugumi's still asleep. She won't wake up for 
a while, so..."

Y工 gave υ▊ a pat on the head.


44 :

{T3C051}
[υ▊]
Is that right?


{T3C052}
[Y工]
"Yep, I'll bet she's pretty tired. Let's let 
her sleep a bit longer."


{T3C053}
[υ▊]
*Sigh*...


45 :

{T3C054}
[υ▊]
"Okay then. So she can eat it later, after 
she wakes up."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


46 :

{T3C055}
[υ▊]
"Let's save it for her. No snacking on it, 
either!"

υ▊ pointed to the sandwich nestled deep in
the food warmer.

...So she'd noticed it.

[Takeshi]
Alright. Roger that.


47 :

{T3C056}
[υ▊]
Great!


48 :

{T3C057}
[υ▊]
Okay, time for some after meal exercise~


49 :

{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!


50 :

{T3C058}
[Kid]
Hey, hold on. I wanna go too.


51 :
Splish, splash, splish...

υ▊, the Kid, and Pipi ran toward the rest
area together.

Y工 and I watched them from behind.


52 :
[Takeshi]
Oh, by the way, Y工...

[Takeshi]
Is Tsugumi resting up?


{T3C059}
[Y工]
"Yeah, actually, I just stopped by the 
infirmary to check on her."

[Takeshi]
How was she?


53 :

{T3C060}
[Y工]
"I'm not a medical expert or anything, so I 
can't say anything specific."


{T3C061}
[Y工]
"But she seems to be recuperating. 
Satisfactory progress, I think."


54 :

{T3C062}
[Y工]
Maybe too satisfactory...

[Takeshi]
What do you mean by 'too satisfactory'?


55 :

{T3C063}
[Y工]
I really don't know how to put it...

[Y工]
...

Y工 suddenly stopped talking and let her head
fall forward.

[Takeshi]
"Well, if her condition is stable, that's 
good, isn't it? The operation went well, right?"


{T3C064}
[Y工]
...Yeeeaaah...

[Takeshi]
"What's up with you? Lose your confidence 
somewhere or something?"


56 :

{T3C065}
[Y工]
No, it's not that...

[Y工]
...


57 :

{T3C066}
[Y工]
Hmmm... Yeah, yeah. That's it!

[Takeshi]
?

Y工 lifted her head as if she had just
realized something.


58 :

{T3C067}
[Y工]
"Perhaps I've lost some of my confidence, but 
I know Tsugumi is recovering."


59 :

{T3C068}
[Y工]
Life force is an amazing thing, huh?


60 :

{T3C069}
[Y工]
You know, humans don't die so easily.

Y工 smiled when she said that.


61 :
After dinner, when we finished cleaning up,
we made our way to the rest area...

Four stone statues were lined up in one
corner of the area.


62 :
One of them extended a hand, pointing toward
the south.


63 :
Another reached toward the east.


64 :
Yet another looked to the heavens while
reaching a hand upward.


65 :
The remaining figure... had both hands pressed
to its chest and eyes closed.


66 :
I wondered if there was some kind of meaning
to all of it.

I asked Y工, but she just shook her head
unknowingly.

It looked like υ▊, the Kid, and Pipi were
running amongst the figures as they played.


67 :

{T3C070}
[Y工]
By the way, I wonder where Sora went...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, you're right. Now that you mention it, 
Sora was here until just before we ate."


{T3C071}
[Y工]
Maybe she's still in the control room.


{T3C072}
[Y工]
"It only happens once in a while, but 
sometimes she'll dive into LeMMIH's main 
console and not come out for quite a while."

[Takeshi]
Really?


{T3C073}
[Y工]
"Seems like she can get pretty caught up in 
her work..."

I wondered if that was that all it was.


{T3C074}
[Y工]
Well, I'll go check it out.

[Takeshi]
Alright, you do that.


68 :
With that, she ran out a nearby exit and down
the corridor.

After having a good stretch, I watched υ▊
and the others play.

The three of them, two kids and an animal,
circled the stone statue.

They were playing a game of chase, not really
caring who was 'it'.

Without seeming to get bored, they kept
running around and around.

On the other hand, I got restless watching
them.

(Phew, what a sight...)

It looked kind of fun, but I didn't quite
feel like asking to join in.

I let my eyes roam around.


69 :
[Takeshi]
Oh...?

[Takeshi]
So that's where you were, Sora.

After her unexplained disappearance, Sora had
appeared next to a nearby flowerbed.


70 :

{T3C075}
[Sora]
Yes, I have been here for a little while.


{T3C076}
[Sora]
I've been looking at the flowers.

I observed the flowers.

In the flowerbed, short roses, marigolds, and
marguerites were all planted together.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, but they sure don't seem to be doing 
very well."


71 :

{T3C077}
[Sora]
I see what you mean.

Nobody had watered them for the past several
days.

The soil was dry, its surface cracked.

The flowers had wilted, and the plants were
beginning to dry up.


72 :

{T3C078}
[Sora]
Life is sure a strange phenomenon.

Sora muttered to herself as she gazed at the
flowers.


{T3C079}
[Sora]
"A bud sprouts from a seed. A flower blossoms, 
reproduces, and then a seed matures and returns 
to the earth."


{T3C080}
[Sora]
"From that seed comes another bud, another 
flower which blossoms and reproduces, and a new 
seed, which in turn returns to the earth."


{T3C081}
[Sora]
And on and on just like that...


{T3C082}
[Sora]
What is the purpose of life?


{T3C083}
[Sora]
Why do flowers bloom?

[Takeshi]
...

I was unable to reply at once.

Why, indeed, did flowers bloom?


{T3C084}
[Sora]
"Whatever the reason or purpose, I think life 
is a wonderful thing."


{T3C085}
[Sora]
"When I see a flower struggling to exist, 
growing from a crack in the concrete, I have 
a strange and wonderful feeling."


{T3C086}
[Sora]
"Flowers are always striving desperately to 
live."


{T3C087}
[Sora]
"Even in an environment such as this, in the 
depths of the ocean, without enough light or 
carbon dioxide..."


{T3C088}
[Sora]
Even in such parched and cracked soil...


{T3C089}
[Sora]
"They never even think of giving up, but just 
struggle courageously to live."


{T3C090}
[Sora]
Doesn't it inspire you?


{T3C091}
[Sora]
...Maybe not.


{T3C092}
[Sora]
"Maybe it's no use contemplating the meaning 
or purpose of flowers..."

Sora glanced up at the ceiling.

I followed suit, also looking up.


73 :
[Takeshi]
Huh?

The shrill sound of a siren rang out loudly.

Tiny sensors hidden in openings of the ceiling
panels were moving wildly.

Once again, I heard the sound of flowing water
coming from somewhere.

[Takeshi]
No way. It can't be another flood!


74 :
Fwwwaaaaaaaashhhh...

Massive amounts of water rained down from the
ceiling.

The drops poured down upon us mercilessly.


75 :
Soon after, we were suffused in a heavy mist...

Sora's appearance changed to that of a rainbow.

[Takeshi]
What in the world?

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora, what's going on?

I tried to steady myself while asking.


76 :
However, it seemed that a smile hovered about
Sora's mouth.

[Takeshi]
...Sora?

I looked up again, checking the ceiling.


77 :
The drops of water were everywhere...

I couldn't see much due to the fine mist.

But...


78 :
[Takeshi]
Oh, it's sprinklers, huh?

Sora nodded without speaking.

[Takeshi]
Water...


79 :
I sipped water from my cupped hands, both
tasting and testing it in my mouth.

The water from the sprinklers was neither a
liquid to extinguish fires nor seawater.

[Takeshi]
Ah... This is filtered water!


80 :

{T3C093}
[Sora]
Yes...


{T3C094}
[Sora]
This complex uses the purest possible water.

[Takeshi]
That means...


81 :
[Takeshi]
"Perhaps it's... meant for watering these 
flowers?"


{T3C095}
[Sora]
Hehe...

She laughed but didn't answer...


82 :
The ceiling was designed so that the water sprayed
down perfectly on the roses and other flowers
below.

Not long after that...


83 :

{T3C096}
[Y工]
Hey, what's going on over here?


{T3C097}
[υ▊]
Sora-san! There's an alarm, an alarm!


{T3C098}
[Kid]
Sora, Takeshi... Are you guys okay?

Everyone came running over in a frenzy,
splashing water with every step.


84 :

{T3C099}
[Kid]
Don't tell me there's another flood!?

[Takeshi]
No, it's not.


{T3C100}
[υ▊]
So what is it?


85 :

{T3C101}
[υ▊]
I mean... everything is totally soaked.


{T3C102}
[υ▊]
Takepyon, you're drenched...

[Takeshi]
Don't worry about me.


86 :
The drops of water were still pouring down
from the ceiling.


{T3C103}
[Y工]
"Oh man, we ran over here as soon as we saw 
the warning on the monitor!"


{T3C104}
[Y工]
It's not the fire alarm!?

[Takeshi]
I'm telling you, there's no fire or flooding...


87 :
[Takeshi]
Uh, let me explain...

[Takeshi]
Y工... could you put that away?


88 :
She held a fire extinguisher in both hands as
if bracing to use it.

She had pulled the safety pin and held out
the nozzle, ready to spray at any instant's
notice.

It was a pretty clumsy-looking attempt.


89 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Y工]
.........


90 :
After a while, the water stopped.

Sora smiled and gazed at the flowerbed.


{T3C105}
[Y工]
Uhhh...


{T3C106}
[Y工]
You don't suppose this was just a prank?

[Takeshi]
Uh, you know...

Now it was my turn to smile.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I guess it was something like that...

[Takeshi]
"Over on that wall, there's some kind of weirdly 
shaped and colored button..."

[Takeshi]
I thought, 'What the heck does this do!?'

[Takeshi]
I couldn't help giving it a little push.


91 :
When I said that, Y工 tossed the fire
extinguisher aside.

Then she turned to hide her face to try to
contain her laughter.


{T3C107}
[Y工]
Kuku... Kukukukuku...


{T3C108}
[Y工]
Kuuu-raaa-naaa-riii!

She balled up a fist and swung it in my
direction.


{T3C109}
[Y工]
Listen here! You're not a kid, you know!


{T3C110}
[Y工]
"Just who broke the group rules the other 
day, huh!?"


{T3C111}
[Y工]
What are you thinking!?


92 :
Y工 was poised to launch into a sermon.

She rambled on, but the words didn't reach my
ears. I was gazing in wonder at the flowers.

The previously wilted and drooping flowers
had, in such a short time, become full of
life and seemed to be dancing about.
