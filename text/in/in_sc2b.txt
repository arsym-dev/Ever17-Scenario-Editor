1 :

{C2S103}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid. So what're you gonna do?

[Kid]
Huh? Me...?

2 :
{11:0-13}
{11:1}I'll help Y¤u

{11:1}I'll wait here

{11:1}Why don't we go together?


3 :
[Kid]
I'm going to help out Y¤u.


4 :

{C2S104}
[Takeshi]
"Okay. In that case, Sara and I will hold down 
the fort here."


5 :

{C2S105}
[Takeshi]
You can't complain about that, right?


{C2S106}
[Y¤u]
Okay.


6 :

{C2S107}
[Takeshi]
Geez. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

It seemed that Takeshi was oblivious to his
disturbing dream the night before.

[Kid]
"I figure that Y¤u is concerned about you in 
her own way."

[Kid]
"Like when she had you carry the heavy 
toolbox... Maybe it was her way of saying 
'rest a bit' or 'take it easy'."


7 :

{C2S108}
[Takeshi]
"You think so? That's a pretty generous 
interpretation, I'd say."


{C2S109}
[Takeshi]
"Oh well. In that case, I guess Sara and 
I will just have to sit back and relax together."


8 :

{C2S110}
[Sara]
"Just so you know, I'm a third-degree black 
belt in Aikido."


9 :

{C2S111}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C2S112}
[Sara]
"Also in karate, and second-degree in 
kendo, and in archery, and a seventh in Iga 
Style Ninjutsu."


{C2S113}
[Takeshi]
?


{C2S114}
[Sara]
"So basically... you'd better not try anything 
on me, you got it?"


10 :
[Takeshi]
..........


{C2S115}
[Y¤u]
Kid, should we get going?

[Kid]
Uh, yeah...

Y¤u and I left the increasingly tense
atmosphere behind.


11 :
The room was covered in a massive web of pipes.

The pipes continued into the adjacent
generator room. It seemed that by opening
and closing the valves, the water and oil
pressure could be adjusted.


12 :
'Normally, LeMMIH is responsible for
maintaining the generator room, but even
it can't do much when the generator
itself goes out.'

'Anyhow, this is all because the power supply
is down.'

'This room is designed so that maintenance can
be performed manually at times like this, or
during blackouts.'


13 :
...That was what Y¤u told me.

Y¤u selected one pipe from the countless rows
of them and instructed me to close its valve.


14 :
As ordered, I turned the valve around and
around.

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u?

I said that as I was closing the valve.


15 :

{C2S116}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
It's about the girl from yesterday.


{C2S117}
[Y¤u]
"Yesterday? You mean the seventh survivor you 
said you saw?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


16 :

{C2S118}
[Y¤u]
"You're sure your eyes weren't playing tricks 
on you?"

[Kid]
I'm positive. These eyes saw her.


{C2S119}
[Y¤u]
Maybe you've got some kind of eye disease.

[Kid]
Huh? Di-disease...?


17 :

{C2S120}
[Y¤u]
"I'm kidding... It's a joke. Why do you always 
take everything seriously?"

[Kid]
Enough already!


18 :

{C2S121}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright... I'll listen to your 
stories of unidentified survivors later."


{C2S122}
[Y¤u]
Right now, we have to work.


19 :
[Kid]
...


20 :
Finally, the valve was completely shut.


21 :

{C2S123}
[Y¤u]
That should do it.

[Kid]
Y¤u, can we talk now...?


22 :

{C2S124}
[Y¤u]
Let's get back to Kuranari and Sara.


23 :
Y¤u took off from the room as if she were a
fugitive on the run.

I was left in the room alone...

I felt an unclear mess of feelings stewing
inside my mind.


24 :
With that, we had been able to shut off the
hot water flowing to the generator room.

Even so, on the other side of the door, it was
still hot enough to scald.

The four of us waited outside the generator
room until we could be sure that the
temperature inside had cooled enough.


25 :
[Kid]
I'll... wait here.


26 :

{C2S125}
[Takeshi]
So what are we going to do?


{C2S126}
[Y¤u]
"Oh well... Then I'll have to make do with 
Kuranari."


27 :

{C2S127}
[Takeshi]
"Geez. You're a piece of work. Can't you let 
your real feelings show?"


28 :

{C2S128}
[Y¤u]
"Don't be getting any strange ideas. You do 
and I'll knock you down. Got it?"


29 :

{C2S129}
[Takeshi]
"...Take it easy. There's no way I'd try 
something on you, even by mistake."


30 :
When the two of them disappeared at the far
end of the corridor, they were still going at it.



31 :

{C2S130}
[Sara]
Those two...

[Kid]
Yeah?


32 :

{C2S131}
[Sara]
"I don't know, I think they make a pretty good 
couple, don't you?"

[Kid]
Think so?


{C2S132}
[Sara]
"Yeah. Nakkyu is the kind of person who tells 
people she likes what she really thinks... She 
speaks her mind."

[Kid]
Hmmmm.


33 :

{C2S133}
[Sara]
Takeshi kind of seems like that too.

I wasn't sure why... but somehow, I was a little
jealous of Y¤u and Takeshi.

Even if I wanted to, I couldn't open up to
anyone like that... I had nothing to share...


34 :
A while after the two had disappeared...

Sara and I hadn't spoken another word.

The two of us just leaned against a wall and
stared into the darkness.

I was desperately trying to think of some way
to break through the wall that had formed
between us.

[Kid]
Sara, how old are you?

Finally, the words tumbled out of my mouth.


35 :

{C2S134}
[Sara]
"Where did that come from...? I thought 
I told you?"

[Kid]
I don't think so.


36 :

{C2S135}
[Sara]
"I'm a junior. I'm sixteen, and I was born January 
21st. Oh, and I'm an Aquarius."

Sara recited it so smoothly that it was like
she was singing a song.


37 :

{C2S136}
[Sara]
And you, Kid?

[Kid]
I'm...

I didn't know.

When I tried to remember, it was like my mind
would fog over.

I couldn't get close to it. It was like a
mirage in the desert.

[Kid]
I... wonder how old I am.


{C2S137}
[Sara]
You don't know that either?

[Kid]
Nope.


38 :

{C2S138}
[Sara]
Hmmm, that's kind of sad.

[Kid]
Yeah...


39 :

{C2S139}
[Sara]
But maybe it's good in a way.

[Kid]
What do you mean?


40 :

{C2S140}
[Sara]
"Well, maybe it was something that you wanted 
to forget about..."

[Kid]
.........


41 :

{C2S141}
[Sara]
Just kidding.

Sara's expression relaxed into a silly look.

[Kid]
Wh-what... Don't scare me like that.


42 :

{C2S142}
[Sara]
Sorry.


43 :

{C2S143}
[Sara]
"I know. Maybe if I chopped you down we'd 
find out how old you are."

[Kid]
Huh?


{C2S144}
[Sara]
"You know, maybe you've got rings like a tree 
stump."


44 :
[Kid]
...

For some reason, my eyes strayed to the palms
of my hands.

In the darkness, only dimly illuminated by the
emergency lights, my fingers appeared to glow
slightly white.

I still didn't know what had happened to my
finger.


45 :

{C2S145}
[Sara]
Your finger...


46 :
Muttering that, Sara grabbed my finger.

[Kid]
...

It was so sudden that it put me at a loss for words.

In the darkness, Sara whispered words like she was
confirming something as she gripped my thumb.


{C2S146}
[Sara]
Moon sprite... shouldering... a long bow...


{C2S147}
[Sara]
Waiting... inside a dream...

............

[Kid]
What does that mean?

Sara just shook her head. There was no sign
that she was going to answer me.

She just murmured the words like a spell or a
nursery rhyme as she gently held my thumb.


(A moon sprite...)

I wondered why Sara had suddenly grabbed my
thumb.

Still, I didn't have any urge to pull it away
from her...

As I remained aware of my thumb, I searched
for an answer from Sara's slightly sweaty,
warm palm.


47 :

{C2S148}
[Y¤u]
Thanks for waiting~


48 :

{C2S149}
[Takeshi]
I think we'll be okay now.


{C2S150}
[Y¤u]
It was a hassle looking for the valve, but...


49 :
With the two of them back, Sara finally released my
thumb.

In the darkness, I couldn't make out Sara's expression
very well.

The area around her mouth pulled down
slightly in a sad motion.

Warmth lingered around my thumb...

I didn't know why, but I hesitated to wipe the
warmth away and gently inserted my hand into
my pocket, leaving my thumb extended.


50 :
With that, we had been able to shut off the
hot water flowing to the generator room.

Even so, on the other side of the door, it was
still hot enough to scald.

The four of us waited outside the generator
room until we could be sure that the
temperature inside had cooled enough.


51 :
[Kid]
Why doesn't everyone go?

That was my idea.


52 :
[Y¤u]
...

[Takeshi]
...

[Sara]
...


{C2S151}
[Y¤u]
Well, I guess that is an option...


{C2S152}
[Takeshi]
"There's no reason we have to split into 
teams of two..."


53 :

{C2S153}
[Sara]
"And Takeshi won't go putting the 
moves on me that way."


54 :

{C2S154}
[Takeshi]
I said I'm not interested.


55 :
So all four of us ended up moving to the room
together.

The room was covered in a massive web of pipes.


The pipes continued into the generator room
next door. It seemed that opening and closing
the valves could adjust the water and oil
pressure.

'Normally, LeMMIH is responsible for
maintaining the generator room, but even
it can't do much when the generator
itself goes out.'

'Anyhow, this is all because the power supply
is down.'

'This room is designed so that maintenance can
be performed manually at times like this, or
during blackouts.'

...That was what Y¤u told me.

Y¤u selected one pipe from the countless rows
of them and instructed Takeshi to close its valve.



56 :

{C2S155}
[Takeshi]
"Geez. You sure have a knack for abusing 
folk..."

Takeshi turned the valve shut, as Y¤u had ordered,
through his complaints.

Sara and I just stood off to the side and watched
the work unfold.

Finally...


{C2S156}
[Takeshi]
Uggghh. Arggh!


{C2S157}
[Takeshi]
Damn. It's no good...


57 :

{C2S158}
[Takeshi]
Y¤u, this won't close...


58 :

{C2S159}
[Y¤u]
Geez. You wimp... You're a man, right?


59 :

{C2S160}
[Takeshi]
"You can say what you want, but this valve 
ain't gonna get shut any faster!"


{C2S161}
[Takeshi]
It's rusted solid! It won't even budge!


60 :

{C2S162}
[Y¤u]
Well, how about trying a wrench?


61 :

{C2S163}
[Takeshi]
Wrench?


{C2S164}
[Y¤u]
There's a bolt on the handle, right?


{C2S165}
[Y¤u]
If you can get a wrench on it, it might move.


{C2S166}
[Takeshi]
Oh. A wrench, huh...?


62 :

{C2S167}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Kid...! You heard her. Gimme the toolbox 
already, would ya?"

I peered around in the darkness.


63 :

{C2S168}
[Takeshi]
What're you doing? I said get me the toolbox!

[Kid]
But... there isn't one here.


64 :

{C2S169}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C2S170}
[Sara]
Takeshi, did you forget to bring it?


65 :

{C2S171}
[Takeshi]
"Oh! Crap! I left it in front of the Generator 
Room..."


66 :

{C2S172}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*... This sucks...

[Kid]
Alright, alright, I'll go get it.


67 :
I ran, heading for the exit.


68 :
Water splashed as I ran along the route we had
come along.

But the generator room was practically
next door.

Less than ten meters later, I turned the corner
and entered the corridor leading to the front
of the generator room.


69 :
[Kid]
Oh, there it is!

The toolbox was sitting right in front of the
door.

I headed toward it.

Every time I put my foot down on the floor,
little ripples formed on the surface of the
water.

The tiny circles of waves collided with the
wall and bounced off of the side of the
toolbox, rippling out in regular
concentric rings.

It was dark. Still, I was able to sense the
changes and coldness in the movement of the
water.

My vision felt surprisingly sharp.


70 :
It happened just then...


71 :
‡LSplash!

There was a big splash and spray of water.

It came from around the right side of the
wall... nearly below the operating console.

The droplets of water scattered gently around
my legs.

The resulting waves stroked my feet.


A fear like I had never felt chilled me to my core.


I readied myself for anything, facing the
darkness.

Just then...


{C2S173}
[???]
Moon sprite shouldering a long bow.

{C2S174}
[???]
Waiting inside a dream.

[Kid]
Wh-who's there...?


{C2S175}
[???]
Tonight, a story by moonlight.

{C2S176}
[???]
Hoping the wait will be short.

[Kid]
H-hey... Who's there...?


{C2S177}
[???]
Sleeping curled and snug.

{C2S178}
[???]
Sleeping in mother's arms.

72 :
[Kid]
£o-£o¢o...

I said the name without thinking.

The shape that suddenly swelled out of the
darkness was undoubtedly the girl from the
compression chamber, the one from the day
before.

And £o¢o was singing a song...


{C2S179}
[£o¢o]
I was waiting for you.

She spoke before I could.


{C2S180}
[£o¢o]
I waited and waited... for you to come...


{C2S181}
[£o¢o]
"I was waiting... all alone like a moon 
sprite..."

[Kid]
Th-then you should have come to me...


{C2S182}
[£o¢o]
I couldn't...


{C2S183}
[£o¢o]
That's... impossible...

[Kid]
Why...?


{C2S184}
[£o¢o]
Because you wouldn't take me with you...

[Kid]
...What?


{C2S185}
[£o¢o]
Will you take me to where everybody is?

[Kid]
"Of course I will! Let's go together right 
now!"

Just as I said that...


73 :
‡LSplash!

A wall of water exploded from near £o¢o's feet.


74 :
Droplets of water scattered everywhere like
mist...


{C2S186}
[£o¢o]
Farewell.


75 :
£o¢o disappeared in the spray.

The resulting waves stroked my feet.

A fine spray of mist erupted skyward and
rained down gently on the waves.

There was the toolbox, left in the darkness...


That was all that I saw.

I forgot myself. All I could do was stand
in that narrow corridor.


76 :
I didn't know how much time had passed.

Dragging the heavy toolbox and my heavier
legs, I returned to the room with the pipes.


77 :

{C2S187}
[Takeshi]
This should just about do it.


{C2S188}
[Sara]
You're not done, are you?


{C2S189}
[Y¤u]
Nope. We're still getting ready.


78 :

{C2S190}
[Takeshi]
Oh, I see...


79 :

{C2S191}
[Takeshi]
"We have to repair the generator next door 
after we finish here."

Takeshi wiped away the sweat from his forehead.


80 :

{C2S192}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Kid... what're you doing there?


81 :
Noticing me, Y¤u turned around.

[Kid]
I brought the... toolbox...


{C2S193}
[Takeshi]
Toolbox?


82 :

{C2S194}
[Sara]
It doesn't look like they need it anymore.

[Kid]
...What?


83 :

{C2S195}
[Y¤u]
Oops. Sorry 'bout that.


{C2S196}
[Y¤u]
Turns out the valve was closed to begin with.


84 :

{C2S197}
[Takeshi]
"So, no matter how much I tried to close it, it 
wouldn't budge because it was already shut."

[Kid]
I heard you... the first time...


85 :

{C2S198}
[Takeshi]
Is that right?

[Kid]
...


86 :

{C2S199}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, don't be like that. These things happen 
sometimes."

[Kid]
I'm not... mad...


87 :
[Sara]
...


88 :

{C2S201}
[Y¤u]
What's wrong?

I decided to...

89 :
{11:0-16}
{11:1}Tell them about £o¢o

{11:1}Not tell them about £o¢o


90 :
...I told them.

[Kid]
Actually...

[Kid]
I saw that girl again.


91 :

{C2S202}
[Y¤u]
Whaddya mean by 'that girl'?

[Kid]
"The girl that disappeared in the compression 
chamber."

[Kid]
I told you last night. Don't you remember?


92 :

{C2S203}
[Takeshi]
Oh, your invisible friend.

[Kid]
SHE'S NOT INVISIBLE!


93 :
I screamed at them as loudly as possible.


{C2S204}
[Sara]
K-Kid, take it easy...


{C2S205}
[Sara]
Just calm down...

[Kid]
...


94 :

{C2S206}
[Sara]
Where did you see the girl?

[Kid]
In front... of the generator room...


95 :

{C2S207}
[Y¤u]
Did she say anything?

[Kid]
Yeah...

[Kid]
"I think she said something about being all 
alone like a moon sprite."

[Kid]
Oh, that's right!

[Kid]
She... She was singing a lullaby.


{C2S208}
[Takeshi]
A lullaby?

[Kid]
"It was the same as the lullaby that Sara sang 
before..."


96 :
Takeshi and Y¤u looked at Sara.

I focused my eyes on her too.


97 :

{C2S209}
[Sara]
I... didn't...


98 :

{C2S210}
[Sara]
Sing any... lullaby...

[Kid]
Liar!


99 :
[Kid]
You did too sing a lullaby before, Sara!

[Kid]
I remember it!


100 :
Sara stared at me as if she felt sorry for me.


Y¤u looked like she had a bad taste in her
mouth.


101 :
Takeshi avoided my eyes and leaned in close to
say something to Y¤u and Sara.


102 :
Y¤u and Sara listened to Takeshi whispering.

[Kid]
What are you whispering about?

[Kid]
I'm fine! I'm not crazy!

[Kid]
Don't... Don't you look at me like that!


103 :

{C2S211}
[Takeshi]
Okay. Everything is fine.


104 :

{C2S212}
[Takeshi]
"So why don't we all go to the place where you 
saw the girl."

[Kid]
She's not there... anymore.

[Kid]
She disappeared...


{C2S213}
[Takeshi]
I see... but maybe she'll show up again.

[Kid]
It's no good. She won't...


{C2S214}
[Takeshi]
I... Uh... Look, we believe you.


{C2S215}
[Takeshi]
I mean, we've decided to believe you.


105 :

{C2S216}
[Takeshi]
"Alright? So... So you just keep your cool, 
okay, Kid?"


106 :
I didn't feel like saying anything else.

Their agreeing with me was somehow sad.

I was sure that the little whispering
conference they had just held went something
along the lines of, 'Just agree with whatever
he says.'

It depressed me and sapped all my energy.

I didn't feel like resisting the three of
them or trying to give myself a pep talk.

I was tired. I thought they could do what they
wanted.

'You just keep your cool, okay, Kid?'

Takeshi's words lacked conviction.


107 :
After that...

When we went back in front of the generator
room there was, of course, no sign of the girl.

The four of us waited outside the generator
room until we could be sure that the
temperature inside had cooled enough.

Time was cruel but forgiving.

My feelings smoothed over slowly with time...


Like protruding bits of a beach rounded by an
endless progression of waves.


After a while, I was back to my normal self.


Only £o¢o's parting word‡L'Farewell'‡Lseemed
to linger in my mind, echoing without end.



108 :
...I decided not to tell them.

The whole story wouldn't have been convincing
anyway.

I knew that for a fact.

So I handled it that way...

[Kid]
Nothing... Nothing at all.


109 :
Then I showed them a gleaming smile.


110 :
With that, we had been able to shut off the
hot water flowing to the generator room.

Even so, on the other side of the door, it was
still hot enough to scald.

The four of us waited outside the generator
room until we could be sure that the
temperature inside had cooled enough.

Time was cruel but forgiving.

My feelings smoothed over slowly with time,
like protruding bits of a beach rounded by an
endless progression of waves.

After a while, I found that I could even think
of my meeting with £o¢o in a detached,
objective way.

Only £o¢o's parting word‡L'Farewell'‡Lseemed
to linger in my mind, echoing without end.



111 :
When we thought the time had come, we timidly
opened the door.

It was like opening the door to a public bath. A
cloud of steam hissed out of the door.


112 :
The heat inside just about defied imagination.

The air in the steam-filled room was heavy and
stuck to the skin.

Inhaling felt like swallowing globs of sticky
hot steam.

Takeshi was opening and closing his mouth like
a fish out of water.
