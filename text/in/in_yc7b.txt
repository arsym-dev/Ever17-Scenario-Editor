1 :
Kicking up his feet, Takeshi screamed to the
void.


{C7A261}
[Takeshi]
Hey, what am I supposed to do...!?


{C7A262}
[Kid]
"Can't you escape by swimming through the 
pool!?"

Hokuto answered.


{C7A263}
[Takeshi]
Idiot!


{C7A264}
[Takeshi]
It's 119 meters underwater down here!


{C7A265}
[Takeshi]
"£o¢o and I won't be able to hold our breath 
that long."


{C7A266}
[Takeshi]
"Besides, in order to surface, we have to 
decompress slowly as we go up."


{C7A267}
[Takeshi]
It's 12.5 atmospheres down here.


{C7A268}
[Takeshi]
And the ocean surface is one atmosphere.


{C7A269}
[Takeshi]
"There's no way we can survive unless we get 
ourselves decompressed."


{C7A270}
[Kid]
How about the elevator?


{C7A271}
[Takeshi]
It's been cut off.


{C7A272}
[Takeshi]
"The elevator tubes were destroyed a long 
time ago."


{C7A273}
[Takeshi]
There's no way to go up.


{C7A274}
[Kid]
Well, let's go to the examination room!


{C7A275}
[Takeshi]
Okay...


2 :
Takeshi ran into the examination room.

He hit the control panel and closed the door.

Strangely, there was no sign of flooding
inside IBF.

There was no sound of running water, and the
tremors had stopped for the time being.

But there was still no time to relax.

£o¢o's body was rapidly reaching its limit.

Takeshi laid £o¢o down on the bed.

He ran toward the side of the desk at the
corner of the room.

He opened the one of the storage bins and
grabbed something.

Something... It was the antibodies for Tief
Blau taken from Tsugumi.

£o¢o hadn't been inoculated with it yet.

[Takeshi]
.........

Without a word, Takeshi gave £o¢o the
antibodies.

£o¢o had long passed the stage of suffering
and lay there looking limp.


{C7A276}
[Takeshi]
Come on... Do the trick...

Takeshi threw the empty syringe away and held
onto £o¢o's hand as she lay there.


3 :
.........

......

...


4 :
A while had passed, but £o¢o's condition
didn't seem to be improving.

As a matter of fact, it seemed to be getting
worse.


5 :

{C7A277}
[Takeshi]
Oh, come on! How come it isn't working!?

Takeshi banged the wall.


{C7A278}
[Kid]
"£o¢o was infected a few days earlier than 
you, Dad."


{C7A279}
[Kid]
"So her disease has been progressing for that 
much longer than everyone else..."


{C7A280}
[Takeshi]
Damn it, we can't just sit here and wait...


{C7A281}
[Takeshi]
Besides, we've got to find a way to escape.


{C7A282}
[Takeshi]
I just need to think of something...


6 :
Takeshi paced around the room with his head
down.

Occasionally, heavy noises echoed from the
ceiling.

Takeshi listened to the noises.

And then...

Takeshi, looking as if he had just realized
something, whispered to himself.


7 :

{C7A284}
[Takeshi]
"I heard an announcement earlier, before 
Tsugumi and I escaped."


{C7A285}
[Takeshi]
"The announcement said something in German 
like 'you're gonna be crushed in a few minutes'."


{C7A286}
[Takeshi]
"But this place is still standing. Why is 
that?"


{C7A287}
[Kid]
I don't know why either...


{C7A288}
[Kid]
But... maybe...


{C7A289}
[Takeshi]
Maybe... what?


{C7A290}
[Kid]
"That announcement might have been about LeMU 
imploding."


{C7A291}
[Kid]
But think about it...


{C7A292}
[Kid]
"This laboratory has been built so that the 
atmosphere on the inside and outside are 
equal."


{C7A293}
[Kid]
"Since they're still balanced, it probably 
won't implode as easily..."

That must have been it.

If you left the cap on an empty plastic
bottle, even if you came back years later,
the air would still be trapped inside.

Which meant that the laboratory should have been
safe...

Unless extreme force was added from
somewhere...

Such as a giant piece of partition from
LeMU falling on it.

Takeshi nodded upon hearing Hokuto's explanation.

Although he didn't seem to be fully convinced...


By accepting the explanation, he was probably
trying to clear one of the many problems
facing him at the moment.


8 :
As time progressed, £o¢o's condition got worse
and worse.


9 :

{C7A294}
[Takeshi]
"Damn it! Why is this all happening? Why!? 
Why!? Why!?"

Takeshi kicked the wall.


{C7A295}
[Kid]
"Well, Dad... you should have given her the 
antibody earlier..."


{C7A296}
[Takeshi]
"Huh!? It's a little late for that now, isn't 
it!?"


{C7A297}
[Takeshi]
"Besides, £o¢o was in the pod under pressure 
at that time!"


{C7A298}
[Takeshi]
I couldn't just open up the lid!


{C7A299}
[Kid]
"But... you could've given her a shot without 
opening the lid."


{C7A300}
[Kid]
Because Y¤u said...


10 :

{T6B219}
[Y¤u]
"It seems that this pod can also do laser 
disinfecting, as well as simple surgery, in 
addition to the oxygen treatment."


{T6B220}
[Y¤u]
"And depending on how you use it, even 
cryogenic suspension..."


11 :

{C7A301}
[Kid]
"Since it has so many other functions, it 
probably should be able to give an 
injection..."


{C7A302}
[Takeshi]
"But Y¤u didn't say a word about being able 
to give shots without opening the lid, did 
she?"


{C7A303}
[Takeshi]
"And if she didn't mention it, it must not be 
possible..."


{C7A304}
[Takeshi]
"Besides, neither you nor I have any idea 
what this device can do."


{C7A305}
[Takeshi]
What's cryogenic suspension anyway?


{C7A306}
[Kid]
It's like hibernation.

Hokuto answered as if anyone would know.


{C7A307}
[Takeshi]
Hibernation?


{C7A308}
[Takeshi]
You mean... like bears do in the winter?


{C7A309}
[Kid]
Yeah.


{C7A310}
[Kid]
"I'm pretty sure that cryogenic suspension 
means you can artificially induce hibernation."


{C7A311}
[Kid]
"It keeps human body temperature low, around 
six to seven degrees Celcius, and reduces your 
heartbeat and breathing to the absolute 
minimum..."


{C7A312}
[Kid]
"That way, it increases your metabolic 
efficiency and conserves as much energy as 
possible."


{C7A313}
[Takeshi]
I see...


{C7A314}
[Takeshi]
Hey, I wonder why they have it here...


12 :
In the middle of saying that, Takeshi stopped
suddenly.

At the same time, Hokuto's thoughts stopped
too.

And then they screamed out at the same time.


{C7A315}
[Takeshi]
"I got it! We'll put her in cryogenic 
suspension!"


{C7A316}
[Kid]
"I got it! We can put her in cryogenic 
suspension!"


13 :

{C7A317}
[Takeshi]
"If her body temperature is kept low, 
it'll slow down the rate of the virus 
infection too, right?"


{C7A318}
[Kid]
Yeah!


{C7A319}
[Takeshi]
"Alright! All we need now is a little more 
time. If we have time, I'm sure it'll work..."


{C7A320}
[Kid]
"If we can slow down that virus even for a 
minute, or a second... it'll be better than 
nothing."


{C7A321}
[Takeshi]
Alright then...


14 :
Takeshi carried the frail £o¢o and set her
into the pod.

Then he started flipping through the manual at
full speed, skimming it.

It didn't seem too difficult to set up.


Takeshi, unlike his usual self, manipulated
the computer terminal swiftly and smoothly.

Then...

All that was left was to turn on the switch.


15 :
£o¢o was asleep in the pod.

Takeshi reached out his hand to the switch
that would close the lid.

A split second before he flipped the
switch... £o¢o quietly opened her eyes.


16 :

{C7A322}
[£o¢o]
Who is that...?


{C7A323}
[Takeshi]
What?


{C7A324}
[£o¢o]
Who's standing behind you, Takepyon...?


{C7A325}
[Takeshi]
Behind me?

Takeshi looked back.

Hokuto was there.


{C7A326}
[Takeshi]
Can you see him, £o¢o?


{C7A327}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, I do...


{C7A328}
[Kid]
£o¢o... It's me, Hokuto.


{C7A329}
[£o¢o]
Hokuto...


{C7A330}
[£o¢o]
Hokuto is your name...?


{C7A331}
[£o¢o]
Can I call you Hokutan...?

The £o¢o of that time didn't seem to know
Hokuto yet.

So who was the phantom girl that I had been
seeing...?


{C7A332}
[Takeshi]
Hokuto...


{C7A333}
[Takeshi]
Is that your name?


{C7A334}
[Kid]
Uh-huh.


{C7A335}
[Takeshi]
Really.


{C7A336}
[Takeshi]
£o¢o?


{C7A337}
[Takeshi]
"I can't see him, but this guy Hokuto helped 
us, you know."


{C7A338}
[£o¢o]
Hokutan...


{C7A339}
[£o¢o]
Thank you...


{C7A340}
[£o¢o]
And...


{C7A341}
[£o¢o]
And... the other person... you...


{C7A342}
[£o¢o]
Thank... you....


{C7A343}
[Takeshi]
Other person? There's someone else?


{C7A344}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, there is...


{C7A345}
[£o¢o]
I can see him... behind Hokutan...

[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

Silence filled the room.

The room temperature suddenly felt lower for
some reason.

£o¢o...

£o¢o was... looking at me.

Just me...

Into my eyes...


17 :
[Blick Winkel]
Are you talking about me?

Feeling flustered, I gathered up my courage
and spoke.


{C7A346}
[£o¢o]
Yes, you.


{C7A347}
[£o¢o]
We finally meet...

[Blick Winkel]
...Huh?


{C7A348}
[£o¢o]
I don't know Hokutan, but...


{C7A349}
[£o¢o]
But I sure know you...


{C7A350}
[£o¢o]
Because...


{C7A351}
[£o¢o]
"Because... all this time... you've been 
watching over me, haven't you?"

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A352}
[£o¢o]
Fourth dimension-san...


{C7A353}
[£o¢o]
Blick Winkel-san...

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A354}
[£o¢o]
Let's play chicks again some time.


{C7A355}
[£o¢o]
We go piyo-piyo... Piyo-piyo...


{C7A356}
[Takeshi]
£o¢o... I was the one...


{C7A357}
[£o¢o]
Hee.

£o¢o's cheeks eased up a little.


{C7A358}
[£o¢o]
I don't think you knew it, Takepyon, but...


{C7A359}
[£o¢o]
I was playing with him too, not just you.


{C7A360}
[£o¢o]
Huh? Isn't that right?

£o¢o was asking me.

[Blick Winkel]
Uh-huh...

[Blick Winkel]
"I might have been watching over £o¢o for all 
this time."

[Blick Winkel]
I've been watching over you...

[Blick Winkel]
I wanted to get closer to you too.

[Blick Winkel]
But it was probably... not possible...


{C7A361}
[£o¢o]
Heehee...


{C7A362}
[£o¢o]
"Then... you were the one who told me that you 
liked me?"

[Blick Winkel]
Yes, I suppose I was...

[Blick Winkel]
...I suppose I was...

£o¢o and I looked at each other.

We were staring at each other...

Our eyes filled with passion...

I felt as though my existence would evaporate
at any second.


{C7A363}
[£o¢o]
What's going to happen to me?

All of a sudden, a dark shadow had covered
£o¢o's eyes.


{C7A364}
[£o¢o]
Am I... going to die?

[Blick Winkel]
"Don't be silly! There's no way you're going 
to die!"

[Blick Winkel]
No matter what, I'll save your life, £o¢o!

[Blick Winkel]
I won't let you die!

Excitedly, I appealed to her.

Although she looked to be in some pain...

£o¢o smiled at me happily...

My heart seemed that it would surely melt...


{C7A365}
[Takeshi]
£o¢o... Basically...


{C7A366}
[Takeshi]
We're going to save you no matter what.


{C7A367}
[Takeshi]
So just relax. I want you to rest now...

As he was saying that, Takeshi went to close
the pod.


{C7A368}
[£o¢o]
Wait!


{C7A369}
[£o¢o]
What's going to happen?


{C7A370}
[Takeshi]
"You're going to sleep for a while, just 
like a cuddly bear."


{C7A371}
[£o¢o]
No...


{C7A372}
[£o¢o]
Please... don't leave me...


{C7A373}
[£o¢o]
Don't go anywhere...


{C7A374}
[£o¢o]
Don't leave me alone...


{C7A375}
[Takeshi]
We're not going to leave you alone, are we?


{C7A376}
[Takeshi]
We're going to stay right here.


{C7A377}
[£o¢o]
You're lying...


{C7A378}
[£o¢o]
I don't believe you...


{C7A379}
[Takeshi]
Quit being so stubborn!


{C7A380}
[Takeshi]
"If we leave you like this, you're going 
to... You're going to..."


{C7A381}
[£o¢o]
No... No... No...


{C7A382}
[£o¢o]
I don't want to...


{C7A383}
[£o¢o]
"I don't want to be all by myself. I'll be 
too lonely."


{C7A384}
[£o¢o]
I'm scared... I'm... so, so scared...

[Takeshi]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A385}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon, will you...


{C7A386}
[£o¢o]
Lie down... and... sleep next to me?


{C7A387}
[Takeshi]
There's no way...


{C7A388}
[Takeshi]
This pod is...

Takeshi stopped in the middle of what he was
saying.

He looked up at the ceiling, then to the
monitor on the wall, and finally to the pod
next to £o¢o.


{C7A389}
[Takeshi]
Alright, how about this then?

[£o¢o]
...?


{C7A390}
[Takeshi]
I'll sleep in the pod next to you.


{C7A391}
[Takeshi]
"How's that? You won't be lonely anymore, 
right?"

£o¢o looked back and forth between Takeshi
and me.

She had a worried look on her face...

And stared at us with eyes that seemed about
to burst into tears.


{C7A392}
[£o¢o]
Really...?


{C7A393}
[£o¢o]
You aren't lying...?


{C7A394}
[Takeshi]
Of course not.


{C7A395}
[£o¢o]
You promise...?


{C7A396}
[£o¢o]
You won't leave me and go?


{C7A397}
[Takeshi]
I wouldn't do that. Of course I won't go.


{C7A398}
[£o¢o]
Alright then...


{C7A399}
[£o¢o]
I trust you, Takepyon.


{C7A400}
[Takeshi]
That's a good girl.

Takeshi petted £o¢o's head.


{C7A401}
[Takeshi]
I'm going to close it now, okay, £o¢o?


{C7A402}
[£o¢o]
Uh-huh...

Takeshi turned on the switch.

The lid of the pod slowly went down.


{C7A403}
[£o¢o]
Hey?


{C7A404}
[£o¢o]
"Before I go to sleep, will you listen to my 
request?"


{C7A405}
[Takeshi]
Request?


{C7A406}
[£o¢o]
I wasn't talking to you, Takepyon...

£o¢o's eyes were pointing toward me.

[Blick Winkel]
M-me?


{C7A407}
[£o¢o]
Yes.


{C7A408}
[£o¢o]
Well, um... I...


{C7A409}
[£o¢o]
I want to see you.

[Blick Winkel]
...What?


{C7A410}
[£o¢o]
I want to see you again.


{C7A411}
[£o¢o]
I want to see you and talk with you more.

[Blick Winkel]
Uh-huh.


{C7A412}
[£o¢o]
I think that I...


{C7A413}
[£o¢o]
I might just...


{C7A414}
[£o¢o]
It's just that I...

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A415}
[£o¢o]
Oh...


{C7A416}
[£o¢o]
I can't say it...

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A417}
[£o¢o]
But will you promise me?


{C7A418}
[£o¢o]
"That... you and I will... see each other again 
someday?"

[Blick Winkel]
Yes.


{C7A419}
[£o¢o]
I'll be... waiting...


{C7A420}
[£o¢o]
I'll wait for you no matter what...


{C7A421}
[£o¢o]
You'll... come... get me...?


{C7A422}
[£o¢o]
Promise?

[Blick Winkel]
Yes, I promise.

The space between the lid and the pod itself
was almost gone.

I could barely see £o¢o through the narrow
slit...

£o¢o faced toward me and whispered one last
thing in her tiny voice.


{C7A423}
[£o¢o]
Well, good night...


{C7A424}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan...


18 :
'Onii-chan!?'‡LBefore I could say anything in
reply, the lid had closed.

The sound of compressing air filled the
room...

The low whir of the motor...

With a light metallic ring, the pod shut
completely.

Takeshi pushed another switch attached to the
pod's chassis.

The cryogenic suspension function was
activated.

There were small sounds as though gas was
leaking out.

The pod slowly cooled down, humming with a
slight vibration.


19 :

{C7A425}
[Takeshi]
Well then...


{C7A426}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Something Winkel! You still there?


{C7A427}
[Kid]
What is it, Dad?


{C7A428}
[Takeshi]
Oh, it's you, Hokuto...


20 :

{C7A429}
[Takeshi]
You guys are confusing me...


{C7A430}
[Takeshi]
"You and that Winkel guy are two different 
people, right?"


{C7A431}
[Takeshi]
"Or you are from the fourth dimension too, 
Hokuto?"


{C7A432}
[Kid]
"No, I'm just borrowing his perspective for 
now."


21 :

{C7A433}
[Takeshi]
Really...


{C7A434}
[Takeshi]
"I mean, I still don't get it at all... but I 
don't suppose it matters."

Saying that, Takeshi sank his body into an
empty pod.

The pod next to £o¢o's.


22 :

{C7A435}
[Kid]
What!? Dad, what're you going to do!?


{C7A436}
[Takeshi]
"What do you think...? There's nothing else I 
can do, right?"


{C7A437}
[Takeshi]
I made her a promise, you know...


{C7A438}
[Kid]
So you're going to...!?


{C7A439}
[Takeshi]
Yep, that's right.


{C7A440}
[Takeshi]
"It doesn't look like there's a way to escape 
anyway."


{C7A441}
[Takeshi]
"We'll just have to wait for the second 
rescue team to arrive..."


{C7A442}
[Takeshi]
"But it'll just be a waste of energy to wait 
here doing nothing, so..."


{C7A443}
[Takeshi]
I might as well get some sleep.


{C7A444}
[Kid]
D-Dad! Wait a second!


{C7A445}
[Takeshi]
No.


{C7A446}
[Takeshi]
I'm tired.


{C7A447}
[Takeshi]
I'm really, REALLY tired...

Takeshi stretched his arm from where he lay
and flicked the switch for both closing the
lid and starting the cryogenic suspension at
the same time.

The lid started to close...

Quietly...

Steadily...


{C7A448}
[Takeshi]
Alright, Hokuto...


{C7A449}
[Takeshi]
I'm counting on you...


{C7A450}
[Kid]
Dad!


{C7A451}
[Takeshi]
Oh, hey, one more thing.


{C7A452}
[Kid]
?


{C7A453}
[Takeshi]
Quit calling me 'Dad', will you?


{C7A454}
[Kid]
Well... I can't help it...


{C7A455}
[Kid]
I'm your son...


{C7A456}
[Takeshi]
No, no, that's not what I mean.


{C7A457}
[Takeshi]
"If you call me 'Dad', why don't you say it a 
little more elegantly?"


{C7A458}
[Takeshi]
Call me 'Father', okay? 'Father'.


{C7A459}
[Takeshi]
You got it?

Hokuto took a deep breath, trying to say
something.

But before he could say it, the lid of the
pod had shut.


23 :
A familiar hissing sound echoed in the room.


The cryogenic suspension had activated.

The pod cooled down with small vibrations.

.........

Just in case, Hokuto and I checked the monitor.

The cryogenic suspension in the two pods was
functioning properly.

There were no signs of abnormalities in the bio
scans of £o¢o and Takeshi.


24 :
The world in 2017...

A laboratory at the bottom of the ocean...

All that remained there was a 'perspective'...

Hokuto and I started to think.

{16:4}

25 :
'Oh yeah! We gotta let everyone know £o¢o and
Takeshi are here in IBF!'

I wasn't sure whether it was I or Hokuto who
thought that.

Maybe it was because we had switched places
so often that the boundary between Hokuto and
myself had started to become very vague.

Our consciousnesses had gotten muddy, tangled,
and intertwined. We were close to a state of
fusion.

{16:4}

26 :
Or maybe...

We might have been that way ever since the
beginning.

My thoughts were the same as Hokuto's, and
Hokuto's thoughts were the same as mine...


'Being me' and 'being Hokuto' weren't all that
different.

{16:4}

27 :
We had been one since long ago and would
continue to be one...

That thought just went through my mind.

But it wasn't the time to be engrossed in such
thoughts.

Our consciousness flew up to the floating
island.

{16:4}

28 :
A miniature submarine was floating on the
ocean surface.

Swaying in the waves and being teased along
by time, it left a carefree trail in the deep
blue ocean.

I searched inside of it, but Tsugumi had
already disappeared.

She must be somewhere on the floating
island...

I expanded my sight and looked down at the
entire artificial island.

I saw someone...

But it wasn't Tsugumi.

It was Yubiseiharukana.

Hokuto and I flew down near her side.


29 :
Walking along with Yubiseiharukana was Pipi.

He was soaking wet.

Which meant that it must have been... right
after Y¤u had picked up Pipi from the ocean
surface.

She was walking down the trail, attended by a
few men who seemed to be staff members of LeMU.

She was walking toward a helicopter.

She was probably on her way to a large
hospital or something.

She looked surprisingly healthy. She was
walking steadily without support.

Although she seemed in a dark mood, at least
her health seemed fine.

The antibodies must have worked, just like
with Takeshi.

Anyway, I needed to tell her what had
happened to Takeshi and £o¢o!


{C7A460}
[Kid]
Y¤u! Y¤u!

It was Hokuto who shouted at her.


30 :

{C7A461}
[Y¤u'haru']
Wh-who is it...?

Caught off guard, she glanced all around.

The staff members darted skeptical looks at
her when she started talking to herself all
of a sudden.


{C7A462}
[Kid]
It's me!


{C7A463}
[Y¤u'haru']
Who is... this 'me'?

There was no way she could have known Hokuto.

Hokuto hadn't even been born in that world...


And she wouldn't have believed us if we had
told her, 'We're talking to you from seventeen years
in the future.'

Hokuto told her...


{C7A464}
[Kid]
Look, there's something I want you tell you.


{C7A465}
[Kid]
So listen to me carefully.


{C7A466}
[Kid]
Actually...

Hokuto told her that £o¢o and Takeshi had
been left in the laboratory and that they
were under cryogenic suspension in the pods.


31 :

{C7A467}
[Y¤u'haru']
N-no way! It can't be...


{C7A468}
[Kid]
So you have to help them right away, okay!?


{C7A469}
[Y¤u'haru']
Are you serious!?


{C7A470}
[Kid]
Totally!


{C7A471}
[Kid]
"£o¢o and Takeshi weren't on the sub that 
rescued you."


{C7A472}
[Kid]
"And the only others who were rescued were 
Tsugumi and Kaburaki..."


32 :

{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!

Pipi looked at Hokuto and me, then gave a loud
bark.


{C7A473}
[Kid]
Oh yeah! Pipi!


{C7A474}
[Kid]
Pipi... had a disc in his mouth, didn't he?


{C7A475}
[Y¤u'haru']
Uh-huh... You mean the terabyte disc, right?


{C7A476}
[Kid]
"That's right, Sora's data and her memories 
are in it..."


{C7A477}
[Kid]
What else, um...


33 :

{C7A478}
[Y¤u'haru']
W-wait a second!


{C7A479}
[Y¤u'haru']
Where on earth are you now!?


{C7A480}
[Kid]
That doesn't really matter.


{C7A481}
[Kid]
You have to believe me!


34 :

{C7A482}
[Y¤u'haru']
How am I supposed to do that...?


{C7A483}
[Y¤u'haru']
What is this... Am I hearing things?


{C7A484}
[Kid]
No, you're not!


{C7A485}
[Kid]
Seriously, Takeshi and £o¢o are...


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Bow*!

Pipi started barking again.


{C7A486}
[Kid]
Oh, oh, I know!


{C7A487}
[Kid]
Pipi! Pipi must have seen it!


{C7A488}
[Kid]
Pipi saw £o¢o collapsed in the hallway.


{C7A489}
[Kid]
"There's gotta be some image data of that 
saved in Pipi's memory."


{C7A490}
[Kid]
Can you play it back?

[Y¤u'haru']
.........

[Kid]
.........


35 :
[Y¤u'haru']
..................

[Kid]
..................

She dropped her head down as if deep in
thought, closed her eyes, and massaged her
temples with her fingertips.

After seeming distressed in that manner for a
while, she must have reached a conclusion.
Y¤u looked up in different direction and
spoke.


36 :

{C7A491}
[Y¤u'haru']
Alright...


{C7A492}
[Y¤u'haru']
"I have no idea who you are, but I'll see 
what I can do."


{C7A493}
[Kid]
Thank you, Y¤u.


{C7A494}
[Kid]
"I'm counting on you. It's about time I get 
back to where I came from."


{C7A495}
[Y¤u'haru']
Where did you come from?


{C7A496}
[Kid]
You wouldn't believe me, but...


{C7A497}
[Kid]
It's... seventeen years in the future...


37 :
Hokuto and I went back to the world of 2034.

Surprisingly, the future had been completely
altered!

Takeshi was there. £o¢o was there.

Yubiseiharukana was there. So was
Yubiseiakikana.

Tsugumi was there. Sara was there.

Sora was there. Kaburaki was there.

And so was Hokuto.

They were chatting happily in a circle.

I didn't know what had happened, but... I was
just relieved...

The future had been altered...


38 :
But how did it happen...?

I supposed Yubiseiharukana had kept her
promise with Hokuto, so £o¢o and Takeshi were
rescued immediately afterward.

In that version of history, Takeshi hadn't
died seventeen years previously, but was still alive
and well.

So, in that world, Tsugumi didn't have to send
Hokuto and Sara to the institution.

In that version of the future, Hokuto and
Sara didn't have to be separated.

Besides...

I understood that the incident in 2034 was
planned so that I, Blick Winkel, would come
into existence.

It was planned to have me descend into the
world so that the past would be altered and
£o¢o and Takeshi would be saved.

But... in that history, £o¢o and Takeshi had
already been rescued safely seventeen years prior.

Therefore, there was no longer any way to
grab my attention and make me appear in the
world.

Therefore, Yubiseiharukana didn't have to come up
with an outrageous plan to trap everyone at
LeMU.

Which meant that the incident starting on
May 1st, 2034, hadn't taken place in that
history.

None of them had been trapped in LeMU.


Which meant that Yubiseiharukana had no
reason to lie to Yubiseiakikana.

Yubiseiharukana must have told
Yubiseiakikana the truth in that history.

As such, they were all able to spend their lives
peacefully from 2017 until now.

They all had lived safely with time just
passing by peacefully and slowly...

And that was what I was seeing right then.


.........


39 :
Hey, but wait a second...

I needed to think a little more about it.

In 2017, Takeshi and £o¢o were saved by
Yubiseiharukana's actions.

So, if the time passed by peacefully,
it would eventually be the year 2034.

There wouldn't be any accident.

I, Blick Winkel, wouldn't appear.

What would happen then?

Hokuto in that world wouldn't talk to Takeshi
in the past (2017).

In the past that I knew...

Hokuto had funneled his raw, untamed force,
and had shouted to Takeshi's body lying on
the bottom of the ocean.

'Dad! DAD! Don't you die on me!'

But in the past retraced from that future,
Takeshi had never heard his son's scream.

That meant...

Takeshi would have long since decomposed on the
bottom of the ocean...

Since Takeshi hadn't come back to life, £o¢o
would have been left in the hallway, and...

Both of them would die.

Because the incident in 2017 had already
taken place as a historical fact.

Which meant that even in the past connected
directly to that world, the incident in 2017
wouldn't have been avoided.

Therefore, that world could never be possible.

It could never exist! It was a paradox!

If that world could exist, a question would
naturally arise.

'Who had saved the Takeshi who is alive here
today?'

Was it Hokuto from a different future...?

Was it that Hokuto from a world where there
had been an accident in 2034... had saved
Takeshi?

No... That wasn't possible...

Because in order for the incident to take
place in 2034...

The condition that 'Takeshi could not be saved in
2017' had to be true.

Which meant...

In order for Takeshi to come back to life at
the bottom of the ocean, the events had to
take place in 2034!

And in order for £o¢o to go under cryogenic
suspension, the events had to take place in
2034!

Therefore, that peaceful world could never
exist!

Just as I reached that conclusion...


40 :
Takeshi, who was cheerfully talking with
everyone, suddenly started to decompose with a
horrible sound.

His skin became soggy and peeled off by itself.

His exposed muscle fibers became dark and
putrid, their surface flaking away.

His cells started to dissolve and run like mud
dripping to the ground.

His abdomen burst open, spilling his internal
organs.

His hair fell out in chunks, exposing the
white skull underneath...

All that was left were white bones with
pieces of red flesh stuck to them.

Eventually, even his skeleton collapsed with
a dry sound.

At the same time‡L£o¢o disappeared
noiselessly.


41 :
Confused, Hokuto and I flew back to 2017.


Yubiseiharukana was still standing in the
same place.


{C7A498}
[Kid]
Y¤u! Y¤u!


42 :

{C7A499}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Wh-what!? You just disappeared, and now you're 
back again...?"


{C7A500}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Don't tell me it was only a joke or 
something."


{C7A501}
[Kid]
I won't.


{C7A502}
[Kid]
It was real. I'm telling the truth.


{C7A503}
[Kid]
"Takeshi and £o¢o are sleeping in the capsule 
pods right now."


{C7A504}
[Kid]
But... But...


{C7A505}
[Kid]
You can't rescue them!


{C7A506}
[Y¤u'haru']
What!? Why is that!?


{C7A507}
[Kid]
It's... It's because...


43 :
[Y¤u'haru']
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u'haru']
..................

[Kid]
..................

[Blick Winkel]
Ah, enough! I can't stand it any longer!

I pushed away Hokuto's consciousness and
jumped to the front.

[Blick Winkel]
You have to wait for seventeen years!

I told her that before anything else.

[Blick Winkel]
"Seventeen years from now, I will reappear before 
you, I promise!"

[Y¤u'haru']
?

Y¤u puckered her lips and cocked her head to
the side.

[Blick Winkel]
"Just listen carefully to what I am going to 
tell you."

I roughly explained to her...


44 :
[Blick Winkel]
"'Seventeen years from now, I will reappear before 
you all.'"

[Blick Winkel]
I just told you that, right?

[Blick Winkel]
"But in order for me to reappear, you will 
need to trick me."

[Blick Winkel]
"So what I am asking you to do is trick me 
seventeen years from now!"

[Blick Winkel]
"Trick me into falsely believing that it is 
the year 2017 again."

[Blick Winkel]
"When that happens, I will still be the third 
eye, Blick Winkel, and that will cause me to 
reveal myself."

[Blick Winkel]
"And unless I reveal myself, neither Takeshi 
nor £o¢o will be saved."

[Blick Winkel]
"Because, in order to restore life to Takeshi, 
who sank to the bottom of the ocean, I will 
need to appear myself and go back to the 
year 2017."

[Blick Winkel]
"If I do not appear myself, Takeshi is going 
to rot at the bottom of the ocean."

[Blick Winkel]
"And if Takeshi fails to reach the 
laboratory, £o¢o will be left in the 
hallway..."

[Blick Winkel]
Both of them will die.

[Blick Winkel]
Do you get it?

[Blick Winkel]
"No matter what happens, you need to stay 
away from IBF until seventeen years from now!"

[Blick Winkel]
"If you save Takeshi and £o¢o now, the events 
in 2034 will fail to take place."

[Blick Winkel]
And if that happens, I will not appear...

[Blick Winkel]
"If I do not appear, then I will be unable to 
save Takeshi and £o¢o in 2017..."

[Blick Winkel]
"Which will form a time paradox, and Takeshi 
and £o¢o will disappear."

[Blick Winkel]
I'll repeat it again, okay?

[Blick Winkel]
"In order for me to appear in the year 2034, 
you MUST NOT rescue Takeshi and £o¢o now."

[Blick Winkel]
"I know it is painful, but that is the only 
way..."

[Blick Winkel]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
And... as for the way to trick me...

[Blick Winkel]
"Well, how can I explain...? You will need a 
bit of preparation."

[Blick Winkel]
However, it should not be too difficult.

[Blick Winkel]
"You certainly have enough time... Seventeen years, 
actually..."

[Blick Winkel]
So, it should not be impossible.

[Blick Winkel]
I will tell you what to do...

[Blick Winkel]
Are you ready?

[Blick Winkel]
"The day to act on the plan will be on 
Monday, May 1st, 2034."

[Blick Winkel]
"First, Sara will be visiting LeMU for a 
school event on that day."

[Blick Winkel]
"Sara is Tsugumi's daughter, who will be born 
next January."

[Blick Winkel]
"She is actually a twin, and her twin 
brother's name is Hokuto..."

[Blick Winkel]
"But due to unavoidable circumstances, 
Tsugumi, Sara, and Hokuto will be separated."

[Blick Winkel]
"So you could probably just tell Tsugumi, 'You 
will be reunited with your son and daughter 
at LeMU.'"

[Blick Winkel]
"If you tell her that, Tsugumi will come to 
LeMU for sure..."

[Blick Winkel]
"Next, you can also invite Hokuto in the same 
way."

[Blick Winkel]
"If you tell him, 'You will meet your mother 
and sister', he will also come alone."

[Blick Winkel]
"You must also have your daughter, 
Yubiseiakikana, work as a LeMU attendant just 
as you did."

[Blick Winkel]
"If you coach her, you could lead her in that 
direction, right?"

[Blick Winkel]
And you must not tell anything to Sora.

[Blick Winkel]
"It is best that you erase her memories of the 
incident in 2017."

[Blick Winkel]
"There is nothing to worry about, because all 
the backup memories are saved in the terabyte 
disc."

[Blick Winkel]
"And finally... you will need the cooperation 
of young Kaburaki."

[Blick Winkel]
"Seventeen years from now, Kaburaki must look and 
act absolutely like Kuranari Takeshi."

[Blick Winkel]
"So he must begin training to look and act 
just like Takeshi."

[Blick Winkel]
Do not worry. He will catch on in seventeen years.

[Blick Winkel]
These six people are required for the plan.

[Blick Winkel]
All you have to do is...

[Blick Winkel]
"Simply throw them all together into LeMU on 
May 1st, 2034, and have an accident similar to 
the one in 2017."

[Blick Winkel]
"If you can arrange this, things will work 
out by themselves."

[Blick Winkel]
"The time in question will be one week, from 
the 1st to the 7th."

[Blick Winkel]
"For these seven days, you must not interfere 
with them."

[Blick Winkel]
"No matter what kind of crisis happens. 
Understood?"

[Blick Winkel]
They will survive by themselves.

[Blick Winkel]
"And... should I show no sign of reappearing 
by 9 p.m. on the 6th..."

[Blick Winkel]
Then I ask of you to rescue them all...

[Blick Winkel]
"Is that clear? Will you do what I just told 
you? You must not forget."

[Blick Winkel]
"On May 1st, 2034, you are going to trick me. 
Understood?"

[Blick Winkel]
"Oh... Wait... I mean, not 'me' to be 
exact... It's actually 'Hokuto'..."

[Blick Winkel]
I want you to trick Hokuto.

[Blick Winkel]
"You must trick him so that he will believe 
it is the year 2017."

[Blick Winkel]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
"Seventeen years from now, without remembering 
why, I might ask you something like..."

[Blick Winkel]
'Why have you called me here?'

[Blick Winkel]
Then I want you to answer this way...

[Blick Winkel]
'I only followed your directions.'

[Blick Winkel]
...That is all.

[Blick Winkel]
"It was kind of lengthy, but... do you 
understand? You got it, right?"

[Blick Winkel]
I need you to understand this...

Yubiseiharukana was surprisingly accepting.

As if overwhelmed by my enthusiasm, she kept
nodding her head.

But I was still worried... about whether she
truly understood everything.

Explaining to her again in more detail, I
repeated the same words, almost as if I were
trying to hypnotize her.

It took several more hours for her to
precisely capture the whole picture.

Hokuto and I made sure that she understood
one last time. Then we left her.


45 :
The world in 2034 had returned to normal.

Hokuto and I were still confronting
Yubiseiharukana.

She kept her mouth closed, as if she had
spoken about everything.

Y¤u (Yubiseiakikana) stood next to her, also
wordless.

In the cold silence, I tried to reorganize in
my mind what had happened so far and started
wondering...

'Why am I here?'

I found the answer easily.

'I have appeared because I was tricked by
myself from the past.'


46 :
In other words...

The mastermind behind the incident in 2034
was no one else other than myself.

In 2017, I had told Y¤u to trick me. Therefore, I
appeared in the world in 2034, having been
tricked by myself.

Thanks to the strength of Hokuto's appeal,
Takeshi had come back to life and saved £o¢o,
helped her into the pod, and activated the
cryogenic suspension.

So... that was what happened...


That moment when Hokuto had shouted out
'Dad!' at the dark bottom of the ocean...

Everything had happened for the sake of that
moment...

It had taken seventeen years and going back in time
to bring the dead back to life...

That was everything.

£o¢o and Takeshi were still sleeping 119 meters
under the ocean.

So I needed to get there!

In order to save them!


47 :
Before I realized it, I was already sprinting
across the island.


48 :
I ran on the grass and jumped into the deep
brush.

Dodging the branches, slicing through the
wind, I ran like a released arrow.

As I pumped my legs, I thought...

(How can I get to the bottom of the ocean...?)


I cut through the woods as I was thinking.

I sprinted over the curving arch of a bridge
and reached the docks, the harbor for the
floating island.

I looked around and didn't see anything that
resembled a minisub.

As I tried to catch my breath, I walked
around the docks.

I noticed there were broken pieces of rock in
the middle of the open area.

All of the pieces scattered around were huge.


They were as big as my whole body.

The surface of the rocks had a refined
smoothness.

Looking closely, I found that some letters
were carved on it.

'Wher' 'abov' 'sky'‡LThere were meaningless
letters jumbled on the pieces of rock near me.

There were letters on the other pieces.

I put the pieces together and tried to guess
the original sentence.


49 :
'Where' 'is' 'heaven?'

'Above' 'the sky,' 'and at' 'your feet...'

[Blick Winkel]
It's a stone monument...

I whispered.

The monument must have fallen down for some
reason and had broken into pieces.

Was it due to the tremor from the accident?

Or had it been the passengers, who in a state
of panic had rushed toward the docks and
knocked it over?

I had no idea what the cause was.

I picked up one of the smaller pieces.

[Blick Winkel]
Oh... It's heavy...

It was probably as heavy as £o¢o.


50 :
And then...

A thought hit me.

'If I jump into the ocean holding this piece
of rock in my arms...'

Before I had time to think it over, my feet
were starting to move.

I ran hard toward the ocean...

The moment I reached my maximum speed, I
kicked off the ground with all my strength.

My body flew in the air...

I jumped high over the fence...

The blue water surface swayed below my eyes...

I splashed into the ocean holding the heavy
piece of stone.

The letters on the piece said... 'heaven'...

Holding 'heaven' tightly to my chest, I
plummeted into the darkness.


51 :
As I sank deeper and deeper, it felt as if I
were running fast with the wind against my
face.

The seawater pressed hard on my eardrums.

Unable to pop my ears because I held 'heaven'
in my arms...

I simply endured the pain.

Water pressure, incredibly high, squeezed my
body.

It felt as if my joints were about to snap
into pieces.

My chest felt as though it would be crushed.

Going deeper, deeper, and deeper...

The deeper I went, the more the water pressure
rose...

My lungs couldn't stand it.

I decided to open my mouth.

[Blick Winkel]
*Blub*...

The air in my lungs came out, and a large
amount of water poured into them.

I automatically gagged and started to choke.

Even then, cold seawater filled my windpipe...


As my lungs filled up with water, I felt
despair welling up inside of me.

How far had I gone?

I looked up and saw the water surface far
above.

I couldn't go back anymore.

I looked below.

I couldn't see anything.

There was only the blue-black darkness.

I couldn't see the bottom of the ocean yet.

No matter how fast I sank, 119 meters was still
very long.

I went deeper and deeper, but the scenery was
unchanged.

The darkness... Darkness... Darkness... A world
covered in darkness...

It occurred to me... that I might...

I might just be swallowed by some deep ocean
trench and keep falling forever. I began to
feel desperate.

The only positive thing was that the pain had
somehow disappeared...

I felt that my conscious mind could still be
clear, as the sense of pain had numbed.

I realized that for the first time in my life.

Actually...

To begin with, the body I was in belonged not
to me, but to Hokuto...

Thinking about that, I felt guilty.

I needed to return it in one piece...

I couldn't see the bottom of the ocean yet.

My brain was running out of oxygen, and I
started to lose consciousness.

My limbs were numb.

The numbness soon turned into spasms.

Against my will, my limbs started to go wild.


I almost dropped 'heaven'.

I quickly pulled it close to me and held it
tighter to my chest.

Going deeper, deeper, and deeper...

I must have looked like a priest at an
exorcism gone wrong, possessed by an evil
spirit, my whole body twitching wildly.

‡LClonk.

I hit a rock surface and stopped sinking.



52 :
‡LSplash!

My momentum carried me flying out of the
water.

Putting my face above the pool, I started
coughing hard, trying to expel all of the
seawater in my lungs.

I clung to the edge of the pool.

Sucking in deep breaths of air.

I coughed hard as I was breathing in and
vomited a large amount of water.

I repeated that many times.

I really understood the suffering Takeshi
had gone through.

I crawled up weakly onto the floor.

[Blick Winkel]
Whew...

But there was no time to relax.

I started running toward the examination room.


53 :
It had been seventeen years since I had last been
there.

I felt the heaviness of all the past years
as I smelled the stale odor in the room.

The paint on the capsule pod had partially
peeled off, and the surface of it was rough
and weathered.

Manipulating the computer terminal, I checked
on the status of the pods.

Both £o¢o and Takeshi were safe.

Under cryogenic suspension, their body
temperatures had been kept at about seven
degrees Celcius, with their heartrates and
breathing reduced to only a few times a
minute. They seemed to be in good health.

The cryogenic suspension device seemed to have
worked properly, without a single glitch, for seventeen
years.

I deactivated the hibernation program for
both of the pods.


54 :
.........

......

...


55 :
Finally...

£o¢o and Takeshi were set to awaken at
any time.

First, I opened £o¢o's pod.


56 :
[Blick Winkel]
£o¢o...


57 :
[Blick Winkel]
£o¢o...

[£o¢o]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
£o¢o...

[£o¢o]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
£o¢o!


58 :

{C7A508}
[£o¢o]
Um... Umm...


{C7A509}
[£o¢o]
Who is it...?

[Blick Winkel]
It's me, £o¢o.

[£o¢o]
.........

[Blick Winkel]
I came to save you...


{C7A510}
[£o¢o]
Um...


{C7A511}
[£o¢o]
You... came...?

[Blick Winkel]
Yes.

[Blick Winkel]
I kept my promise, didn't I?


{C7A512}
[£o¢o]
The promise...


{C7A513}
[£o¢o]
...The promise...


{C7A514}
[£o¢o]
...The promise...?

£o¢o rubbed her eyelids and blinked repeatedly.


{C7A515}
[£o¢o]
Oh...


{C7A516}
[£o¢o]
Ah...!


{C7A517}
[£o¢o]
Ahhh...!


{C7A518}
[£o¢o]
I knew it!


{C7A519}
[£o¢o]
So you DID come to save me!


59 :
£o¢o jumped up and hugged me.

No, was it actually Hokuto who she had
hugged...?

Was it me... or was it Hokuto...?

Was it Hokuto that wasn't me... or was it me
that wasn't Hokuto...?

I did not fully understand... but still...

I hugged £o¢o tightly too.


60 :

{C7A520}
[£o¢o]
"You know, I've been waiting for you sooooo 
long!"

[Blick Winkel]
I know.


{C7A521}
[£o¢o]
I've been waiting for you so so so long!

[Blick Winkel]
I know.


{C7A522}
[£o¢o]
I knew you would come and get me.


{C7A523}
[£o¢o]
I wanted to see you so bad...


{C7A524}
[£o¢o]
I just... had to see you again...


{C7A525}
[£o¢o]
My onii-chan...

[Blick Winkel]
Y-yeah...

[Blick Winkel]
But £o¢o...?

[Blick Winkel]
I'm not actually your brother...


{C7A526}
[£o¢o]
Oh, that's alright.


{C7A527}
[£o¢o]
"A girl who doesn't have a brother could call 
someone who is like a brother onii-chan!"

[Blick Winkel]
Where is that written?


{C7A528}
[£o¢o]
It's not written anywhere.


61 :

{C7A529}
[£o¢o]
I just decided it~


62 :
£o¢o stepped away from me.

£o¢o and I stared at each other as if we were
drawn to each other.


{C7A530}
[£o¢o]
Hey? It's strange...


{C7A531}
[£o¢o]
"I thought I had so many things to talk to 
you about when I finally saw you, but..."


{C7A532}
[£o¢o]
I don't know why, but...


{C7A533}
[£o¢o]
I get all tongue-tied...

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A534}
[£o¢o]
Oh, but one thing...


{C7A535}
[£o¢o]
"Can I tell you something I couldn't tell you 
before?"

[Blick Winkel]
Sure.


{C7A536}
[£o¢o]
Well...


{C7A537}
[£o¢o]
I...


{C7A538}
[£o¢o]
I think you'll be surprised, but...


{C7A539}
[£o¢o]
You might not believe me, but...


{C7A540}
[£o¢o]
I...


{C7A541}
[£o¢o]
Well, I...


63 :

{C7A542}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan, I might have fallen in love with you.

'What!?'

My heart skipped a few beats.

[Blick Winkel]
B-but...

[Blick Winkel]
But I still... Ah...


64 :

{C7A543}
[£o¢o]
For seventeen years...


{C7A544}
[£o¢o]
For seventeen years...


{C7A545}
[£o¢o]
I've been waiting for you, onii-chan.


{C7A546}
[£o¢o]
"I've known about you since seventeen years ago, 
you see?"

[Blick Winkel]
.........


65 :

{C7A547}
[£o¢o]
"You've been watching over me this whole 
time."


{C7A548}
[£o¢o]
But I've been watching you too...

It all started to make sense to me...

£o¢o and I had been sharing the same time...

I must have been sharing experiences with £o¢o
through Takeshi's point of view...

I had always been by £o¢o's side...


66 :

{C7A549}
[£o¢o]
"Would it be so bad if I fell in love with 
you?"

[Blick Winkel]
I don't think so, really...


67 :

{C7A550}
[£o¢o]
Well then~


{C7A551}
[£o¢o]
It's decided~


{C7A552}
[£o¢o]
From now on, you and I are sweethearts, okay?


68 :
[Blick Winkel]
...What?


69 :
Before I got a chance to ask her back, £o¢o
jumped into my arms again.

£o¢o had regained all her strength.

Maybe the antibody had kicked in while she
was under cryogenic suspension.

Whatever it was... I was relieved...

My heart was filled with waves of happiness.


70 :
It had taken me a while, but it was finally
Takeshi's turn.

I gave the body back over to Hokuto since I
wanted them to have a family moment.


71 :
Hokuto opened Takeshi's pod.


{C7A553}
[Kid]
Dad!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C7A554}
[Kid]
Dad!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C7A555}
[Kid]
Dad! Wake up!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C7A556}
[Kid]
Faaaather!


72 :

{C7A557}
[Takeshi]
...Um!?

Takeshi abruptly woke up.


{C7A558}
[Takeshi]
Wh-where...? Is this...?

He looked around, confused.

Takeshi realized that Hokuto's face was in
front of him and said...


{C7A559}
[Takeshi]
Wh-who on...


{C7A560}
[Takeshi]
Earth are you...?


{C7A561}
[Kid]
It's me, Dad!

Takeshi took a close look at Hokuto's face.

He looked over Hokuto's whole body.

He closed his eyes tightly and started
banging his forehead with his palm.

He opened his eyes and glared at the
examination room wall.

Then Takeshi gasped, as if he realized
something, and looked at Hokuto again.


{C7A562}
[Takeshi]
So... you're that... 'Hokuto'?


{C7A563}
[Kid]
That's right, it's me, Dad!


{C7A564}
[Kid]
Dad! Dad! I've missed you so much!


{C7A565}
[Kid]
Daaaaad...

Raising his voice like a child, Hokuto rubbed
his face against Takeshi's chest.


{C7A566}
[Takeshi]
Hey, hey, hey... Wait a sec, Hokuto...

Takeshi pushed back Hokuto.


{C7A567}
[Takeshi]
Take it easy, will you? Alright?

Takeshi tapped Hokuto on the back...


{C7A568}
[Kid]
?


73 :
Takeshi raised himself and stretched his legs
outside the pod.

£o¢o rushed at him.


74 :

{C7A569}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon~

£o¢o hastily jumped at Takeshi and hugged him.


75 :

{C7A570}
[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o! You look all better now!


76 :

{C7A571}
[£o¢o]
Uh-huh, I don't have a single sore spot!


{C7A572}
[Takeshi]
"That's great... Looks like the plan worked out 
beautifully, didn't it?"


{C7A573}
[Takeshi]
I'm glad. I'm glad.


{C7A574}
[Kid]
Dad! Dad!

Hokuto jumped at Takeshi and hugged him just
like £o¢o.


77 :

{C7A575}
[Takeshi]
Whoah, stop it now!

Takeshi forcefully peeled him away...


{C7A576}
[Kid]
Wh-why!? Why don't you want me to hug you!?


78 :

{C7A577}
[Takeshi]
"Before I answer that question, there's 
something I want to ask you."


{C7A578}
[Kid]
What is it?


{C7A579}
[Takeshi]
How long have I been sleeping?


{C7A580}
[Takeshi]
A day? Two days?


{C7A581}
[Takeshi]
Oh man, I didn't sleep for... a week, did I?


79 :

{C7A582}
[Kid]
...Huh?


{C7A583}
[£o¢o]
...Huh?


80 :

{C7A584}
[Takeshi]
Ugh...


{C7A585}
[Takeshi]
"Guessing from your reaction... it's been 
more than a week...?"


81 :
[Kid]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


82 :

{C7A586}
[Takeshi]
A month?

[Kid]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


83 :

{C7A587}
[Takeshi]
Th-three months, then... maybe?

[Kid]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


{C7A588}
[Takeshi]
Y-you gotta be kidding...


{C7A589}
[Takeshi]
"You mean I've slept past summer and into 
autumn...?"

Hokuto and £o¢o closed their eyes and shook
their heads.


{C7A590}
[£o¢o]
Today is Sunday, May 7th...


{C7A591}
[Kid]
The last day of the holiday.


84 :

{C7A592}
[Takeshi]
FWAHAHAHA!


{C7A593}
[Takeshi]
"Whew, c'mon, you had me scared for a second 
there..."


{C7A594}
[Takeshi]
So it's only been a few hours since then...

Hokuto and £o¢o looked at each other, nodded,
and said...


{C7A595}
[Kid]
Dad? I don't want you to panic, alright?


85 :

{C7A596}
[£o¢o]
Just calm down and listen...


86 :
[Takeshi]
.........


87 :

{C7A597}
[Kid]
Well, actually...


88 :

{C7A598}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon...


89 :

{C7A599}
[Kid]
You have been...


90 :

{C7A600}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping for...


91 :

{C7A601}
[Takeshi]
Se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se...


{C7A602}
[Takeshi]
Seventeen yeeeeaaaaarrrrrrssss!?


92 :
After a while...

Yubiseiharukana took a small submersible to
pick us up at the IBF pool.

Inside the minisub, she scolded Hokuto...


{C7A603}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You've got to be out of your mind to dive 
into the ocean like that."


{C7A604}
[Y¤u'haru']
I mean, 119 meters...


{C7A605}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Don't you know, Hokuto? In this world, 
there's this wonderful and safe vessel for 
going underwater called a 'submarine'."


{C7A606}
[Y¤u'haru']
Why didn't you just let me know?


{C7A607}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You're so stupid! Pure foolishness! You 
must be the dumbest guy in history!"


{C7A608}
[Y¤u'haru']
"It must come from your father's side of the 
family... Yeah..."

She kept picking on Hokuto until they reached
the surface.

Hokuto must have been thinking...

'It wasn't really me who decided to jump into
the ocean...'


93 :
The whole time, Takeshi still hadn't accepted
the fact that he had been sleeping for seventeen
years.

No matter how many times they tried to
explain, he just wouldn't listen.

Therefore, Takeshi still couldn't believe that
Hokuto was truly his son.


94 :
Under the bright sunlight, Takeshi, £o¢o,
Hokuto, and Pipi were hanging around.


{C7A609}
[Takeshi]
Good morning.


{C7A610}
[Takeshi]
Those are such nice words...


{C7A611}
[Takeshi]
"They make me feel like getting up and doing 
my best."


{C7A612}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, I agree.


{C7A613}
[£o¢o]
Okay then, I'll say it too...


{C7A614}
[£o¢o]
Good morning, Takepyon.


{C7A615}
[Takeshi]
Ah, good morning, £o¢o.


{C7A616}
[Kid]
Well, me too...


{C7A617}
[Kid]
Good morning, Dad.


{C7A618}
[Takeshi]
Good morning, son...


{C7A619}
[Takeshi]
Son!? I don't have a son!


{C7A620}
[Kid]
You've got a daughter too.


{C7A621}
[Takeshi]
Hey, don't start adding kids like that!


{C7A622}
[Takeshi]
"So are you telling me I'm the father of two 
children at my age?"


{C7A623}
[Kid]
That's right.


{C7A624}
[Kid]
And it's true whether you like it or not...


{C7A625}
[Kid]
Right, £o¢o?


{C7A626}
[£o¢o]
Right, Hokutan?


{C7A627}
[Kid]
Nyahahahahahaha~


{C7A628}
[£o¢o]
Kyahahahahahaha~

Listening to their cheerful laughter, I
thought to myself...

'I should be going back to where I came from.'

As I began to fade, I heard only their happy
voices behind me.


{C7A629}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon, Takepyon!


{C7A630}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C7A631}
[£o¢o]
I've got a new onii-chan!


{C7A632}
[Takeshi]
Onii-chan?


{C7A633}
[£o¢o]
"Uh-huh, he's actually my onii-chan and my 
boyfriend at the same time..."


{C7A634}
[Takeshi]
Reeeally. Well, good for you.


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


{C7A635}
[Kid]
Hey, Dad! Dad!


{C7A636}
[Takeshi]
I told you NOT to call me Dad!


{C7A637}
[Kid]
How about Father, then?


{C7A638}
[Takeshi]
Don't call me that either!


{C7A639}
[Kid]
"Why not? You told me to call you Father 
before..."


{C7A640}
[Takeshi]
Well, that just slipped out of my mouth...


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!


{C7A641}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon, Takepyon!


{C7A642}
[Takeshi]
What's that?


{C7A643}
[£o¢o]
Pu-pu-ku-pu~ Pu-pu-ku-pu~


{C7A644}
[Takeshi]
You're not making any sense!


{C7A645}
[Kid]
Hey, Dad, Dad!


{C7A646}
[Takeshi]
What is it now!?


{C7A647}
[Kid]
Chuwa-chuwa-chuwa-chuwa~


{C7A648}
[Takeshi]
You too, huh!?


{PIPI_09}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!


{C7A649}
[Takeshi]
What's up, Pipi?


{PIPI_19}
[Pipi]
*Awoooooooooo*!


{C7A650}
[Takeshi]
You just wanted to howl!


{C7A651}
[£o¢o]
Takepiyo, Takepiyo!


{C7A652}
[Takeshi]
Hey, stop changing my nickname!


{C7A653}
[£o¢o]
"£o¢o-chan's short comedy! If £o¢o-chan were
a monster..."


{C7A654}
[£o¢o]
"Grrr, grrr, I'm a monster! Thump, thump, 
thump! I'm going to destroy everything! Grrrr!"


{C7A655}
[Takeshi]
Where's the punchline?


{C7A656}
[Kid]
My grandfather's son, my grandmother's son!


{C7A657}
[Takeshi]
That's so confusing!


{C7A658}
[Kid]
"Hokutan's comedy sketch! If I became a twelfth 
grader..."


{C7A901}
[Kid]
"Since I've made it all the way to twelfth 
grade, I'll try my best not to forget to 
bring stuff to school."

{C7A902}
[Kid]
"Since I always seem to forget my protractor, 
I'll do my best to remember it."

{C7A660}
[Takeshi]
"That's a resolution, not comedy! Well, do 
your best! Don't you forget it, ya hear!?"


{PIPI_09}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!


{C7A661}
[Takeshi]
What's with you this time, Pipi?


{PIPI_19}
[Pipi]
*Awoooooooooo*!


{C7A662}
[Takeshi]
"Let me guess, just wanted to howl again, 
huh..."


{C7A663}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon, Takepyon!


{C7A664}
[Takeshi]
What is it now...?


{C7A665}
[£o¢o]
"I want to play cater-pi-llarrrr, I want to 
play cater-pi-llarrrr, I want to play 
cater-pi-llarrrr!"


{C7A666}
[Takeshi]
Well, go ahead. No one's stopping you, right?


{C7A667}
[Kid]
Dad, Mom!


{C7A668}
[Takeshi]
What, am I BOTH now...?

[Kid]
.........


{C7A669}
[Takeshi]
"Look, if you can't think of anything to say, 
don't say anything!"


{PIPI_09}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!


{C7A670}
[Takeshi]
You're just going to howl again...


{PIPI_17}
[Pipi]
*Awoo*.


{C7A671}
[Takeshi]
Oh, it's shorter now. Hey, that's kind of new.


{C7A672}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon, Takepyon!


{C7A673}
[Takeshi]
What is it?


{C7A674}
[£o¢o]
Pu-pu-ku-pu~ Pu-pu-ku-pu~


{C7A675}
[Takeshi]
There you go again...

I decided to leave as I was hearing their
happy voices.


{C7A676}
[£o¢o]
Oh! Wait a minute! Onii-chan!

[Blick Winkel]
...What?


{C7A677}
[£o¢o]
Can I see you again?


{C7A678}
[£o¢o]
I know I'll see you again. No matter what.


{C7A679}
[£o¢o]
I believe in you...


{C7A680}
[£o¢o]
Because, after all...


{C7A681}
[£o¢o]
You and me are both from the sun, right?


{C7A682}
[£o¢o]
We can use psychic power.


{C7A683}
[£o¢o]
Okay? So believe in me too.


{C7A684}
[£o¢o]
Your world and my world are connected.


{C7A685}
[£o¢o]
Our two worlds are... going to be united...


{C7A686}
[£o¢o]
"And at the intersection, there's a 
perspective..."


{C7A687}
[£o¢o]
I'll always be with you, onii-chan...


{C7A688}
[£o¢o]
Okay, so I'll see you then!


{C7A689}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan~
