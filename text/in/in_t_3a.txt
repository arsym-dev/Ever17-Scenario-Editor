1 :
I awoke from my slumber.

A stale, cold feeling...

I remembered slouching in the chair and
slumping forward on the table.

Even then, the sleep that I'd gotten was far
better than the day before.

[Takeshi]
Hey, g'mornin'...


2 :

{T3A000}
[Y¤u]
Oh, good morning.

It appeared that Y¤u had gotten up just
before me.

[Takeshi]
What time is it?


{T3A001}
[Y¤u]
Almost 5:50 a.m., I think...

[Takeshi]
You sure are an early riser.


3 :

{T3A002}
[Y¤u]
"What are you talking about? You're just 
lazy..."


4 :
Saying that, Y¤u let out a big yawn.


5 :

{T3A003}
[Y¤u]
"Then again, being all tense for so long just 
gets you tired. It's probably better to sleep 
when you can."


6 :

{T3A004}
[Y¤u]
"Being in a situation like this, we really 
need to keep well-rested."


{T3A005}
[Y¤u]
"Cause when it comes down to it, if we can't 
think our way out of this situation, we're in 
trouble."

[Takeshi]
Hey, I said that yesterday.


7 :

{T3A006}
[Y¤u]
Yeah... I suppose you did...

Dodging the subject, Y¤u laughed slightly.


{T3A007}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, since you're up, why don't you go wash 
your face?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I might as well...

[Takeshi]
"Ah! Hey, you didn't write on my face again, 
did you...!?"

I instinctively rubbed my cheeks.


{T3A008}
[Y¤u]
Don't worry, I didn't write anything.


8 :
I stood up slowly and checked my surroundings.

£o¢o had arranged some chairs to create a
makeshift bed. She was asleep on top of them.

And at the base of her pillow, Pipi's neck was
cocked to the side.

It looked like he was sleeping too.

I got up, squeezed by the sleeping £o¢o, and
opened the door.


9 :

{T3A009}
[Kid]
Hey.

[Takeshi]
...Oh, mornin', Kid.


10 :

{T3A010}
[Kid]
Hey, don't look so depressed, Takeshi.

[Takeshi]
I'm still sleepy.


{T3A011}
[Kid]
"Well, a lot's happened in the last couple 
of days. Are you worn out?"

[Takeshi]
"I'm alright. I just need to freshen up, that's all. 
See ya."


11 :
I headed to the nearest bathroom.

The water covering the floor seeped into my
shoes, which had only just finished drying.
They got wet all over again.

My socks got heavy and clung to my feet.

My pace slowed.

[Takeshi]
.......

[Takeshi]
.......

[Takeshi]
...Argh! What a freakin' pain!


12 :
Splash!

Scooping up water from around my feet, I
splashed it on my face.

[Takeshi]
Whoa, that's cold...!

I was shivering, but at the same time, my
whole body felt awake.

So that was why people washed their faces in the
morning...


13 :
When I went back to the conference room, the
conversation quickly turned to what we were
going to eat.

[Takeshi]
"Tsugumi and Sora aren't here. You sure it's 
okay?"


14 :

{T3A012}
[Y¤u]
"That's true... but they'll probably show up 
eventually."

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, knowing those two, you're probably 
right."


15 :
I decided to wake up £o¢o.

[Takeshi]
Hey, get up. It's morning.

I shook her shoulder gently.


16 :

{T3A013}
[£o¢o]
Funyuu... Hmmmmm...

Rubbing her eyes, £o¢o got up slowly.


17 :

{T3A014}
[£o¢o]
Oh, good morning... onii-chan...

[Takeshi]
...Huh? Onii-chan?

[Takeshi]
"Oh, I see. You have a brother, £o¢o? But I'm 
not your brother..."


18 :

{T3A015}
[£o¢o]
No... Onii-chan...


{T3A016}
[£o¢o]
"We need to get ready, or we'll be late for 
school..."

£o¢o was still half in dreamland.

[Takeshi]
Late for school?

[Takeshi]
What are you talking about?


19 :

{T3A017}
[£o¢o]
Well, that's just the setting it is...

[Takeshi]
Uh, listen...

[Takeshi]
Stop messing around, we're going to eat.


20 :

{T3A018}
[£o¢o]
Ah... Okay, Takepyon.


21 :
We all made our way to the kiosk.

[Takeshi]
Everyone okay with hotdogs?


22 :

{T3A019}
[£o¢o]
Hotdogs?


{T3A020}
[Y¤u]
They have hotdogs here?

[Takeshi]
"Well, I found a few in the back of the 
fridge. Must've been on the stealth menu."


23 :
I was relegated to cook duty again.


24 :

{T3A021}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari, are they done yet?


25 :

{T3A022}
[Y¤u]
Why do I have to be so hungryyy?


{T3A023}
[Y¤u]
My stomach is going to cave in...


26 :

{T3A024}
[Y¤u]
I'm going to become two-dimensional.


{T3A025}
[Y¤u]
And float away on the wind.

[Takeshi]
Would you shut up already?


27 :

{T3A026}
[Y¤u]
Hahaha...


28 :
I was inside the kiosk that had been made to
look like a submarine.

Sausages were sizzling in a frying pan.


They sold sub sandwiches there, so I guessed the
exterior of the place was a sorry play on that.

(...Why am I thinking about stupid things like
that...?)

In a little while, the place started to smell
great.

I carefully placed a sausage in the toasted,
lightly buttered hotdog buns.

[Takeshi]
Alright, whoever wants to eat, get in line!


29 :

{T3A027}
[£o¢o]
I'm first!

[Takeshi]
Oh!? Well, here ya go.


30 :

{T3A028}
[£o¢o]
Thank you~


31 :
[Takeshi]
Help yourself to ketchup and mustard.


32 :

{T3A029}
[Kid]
Uh, I'd like one too...


33 :

{T3A030}
[Y¤u]
Hey, wait in line! The next person is M-E-!


34 :
That was probably the way things usually were
at the shop.

There still wasn't any schedule as to when we
might get out of LeMU.

But in the meantime, we'd stopped thinking
about the difficult and negative things.


35 :

{T3A031}
[Kid]
"I'm not sure why, but you look like you're 
having fun."

[Takeshi]
Who, me? You think so? Fun... I guess, maybe...

I wiped the sweat caused by the heat of
cooking from my face.


36 :

{T3A032}
[£o¢o]
"Yeah, you look like you might even be enjoying
your life here."

[Takeshi]
"I wonder how that'd feel... I guess it'd be 
kind of fun, owning a stand like this!"


37 :

{T3A033}
[Kid]
Owning... a stand...

The Kid stifled a laugh.


38 :

{T3A034}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you really do look like you work 
here."

[Takeshi]
"Hotdogs, get your hotdogs! They're on the 
house!"


39 :

{T3A035}
[£o¢o]
"You don't think that maybe you could have 
sold hotdogs in a past life?"

[Takeshi]
Aw shucks, dear customer, you're just sayin' that...


40 :

{T3A036}
[Y¤u]
"No, £o¢o, I don't think he was a hotdog man, 
I think he was..."


41 :

{T3A037}
[Y¤u]
...A sandwich man?

[Takeshi]
Ah, come on, Y¤u!


42 :

{T3A038}
[Y¤u]
Ahahahaha...

[Takeshi]
...Hahaha.


43 :
I supposed we were just happy to be eating hot
food.

We could worry about the details after our
stomachs were full.

For the time, we were enjoying eating that
simple meal.


44 :
After spending some time laughing...


45 :

{T3A039}
[Kid]
Ah...!

The Kid suddenly looked up at the ceiling.


46 :

{T3A040}
[Kid]
Wh-what's that...?

He blinked; his eyes were focused on the
ceiling as if he had seen something.


47 :
[Takeshi]
H-hey, what's wrong?

My curiosity piqued, I asked him.

And following his gaze, I looked up at the
ceiling.

But I couldn't see anything out of the
ordinary...


48 :

{T3A041}
[Kid]
I wonder...


{T3A042}
[Kid]
"I don't know what it was, but I swear I saw 
something."

[Takeshi]
Saw something? Like what?


{T3A043}
[Kid]
Uhh... Well, I didn't really see it...


{T3A044}
[Kid]
"I just have a bad feeling... about the second 
floor... somewhere."

[Takeshi]
What the heck are you talking about?


{T3A045}
[Kid]
"Um, I think we should check that floor one 
more time..."

His eyes looked upward again, and he started
mumbling incoherently. Concerned, I shook his
shoulder.


49 :
And then he snapped out of it.

[Takeshi]
"Don't worry about it. If something's up, Sora 
would warn us about it, right?"


50 :

{T3A046}
[Kid]
Yeah... You're right... but still...

[Takeshi]
Looks like I'm not the only one who's tired.


51 :
Then Tsugumi appeared out of nowhere.


52 :

{T3A047}
[Tsugumi]
What just happened?

[Takeshi]
"Ah, everyone was eating hotdogs. Hey, I've 
got one for you too."

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi took it without saying anything.


53 :
I could hear the sound of her taking the
hotdog out of its wrapper.

And I watched her motions carefully.

I swallowed, watching her...

Tsugumi placed the wrapper on the counter...

Slowly, with the ketchup in her right hand
and the mustard in her left, she squeezed the
tubes. Their contents gushed out.

[Takeshi]
H-hey, Tsugumi!


54 :

{T3A048}
[Tsugumi]
What?

The hotdog was entirely covered in red and
yellow.

[Takeshi]
"You eat that much mustard and... it'll kill 
you..."


55 :

{T3A049}
[Tsugumi]
...Really?

Tsugumi bit into the hotdog.


56 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
H-hey? Is it spicy? I bet it's spicy?


57 :

{T3A050}
[Tsugumi]
Not really.

[Takeshi]
"You're probably thinking to yourself, 'Dang, 
I put way too much on!', right?"


58 :

{T3A051}
[Tsugumi]
...I don't... really care.

And after that, she continued eating in
silence.

But I thought I'd seen a glimmer.

Of eyes slightly starting to tear up.

[Takeshi]
Hey, don't strain yourself.


59 :

{T3A052}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not. I'm finished.

[Takeshi]
Oh...

60 :
{11:0-aa}
{11:1}Where'd you go this morning?

{11:1}Hey, you want another one?


61 :
[Takeshi]
By the way, where'd you go this morning?


62 :

{T3A053}
[Tsugumi]
...Why? What do you want to know that for?

[Takeshi]
"Well, when everyone went to bed, you were 
still with us, right?"

[Takeshi]
"But when we got up, we couldn't find you, 
so..."


63 :

{T3A054}
[Tsugumi]
So what...?


{T3A055}
[Tsugumi]
It's none of your business.

[Takeshi]
That's not true.

[Takeshi]
"I'm in charge of breakfast, right? So I just 
wanted to know if you wanted some."


64 :

{T3A056}
[Tsugumi]
I ate, okay? Enough already.

[Takeshi]
What? No, uh, I mean, YEAH, but...

[Takeshi]
"It was on my mind, you know? I guess I was 
worried..."

[Takeshi]
I wondered, what happened to you?

[Takeshi]
"Where'd you go? Where do you always 
disappear to?"

[Takeshi]
I guess I just wanted to know.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, I got it... You just had to find a place 
to go by yourself, right?"


65 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

As usual, those questions were getting me
nowhere.

[Takeshi]
"Well, if you don't want to answer, don't 
worry about it."


66 :
[Takeshi]
"Hey, you want another one? I can make you 
one."


67 :

{T3A057}
[Tsugumi]
No thanks.

[Takeshi]
"You always just wolf your food down. I don't 
know, but there just isn't much satisfaction 
in cooking for you."

[Takeshi]
"Besides, with all that ketchup and mustard 
on it, you probably can't even taste it."


68 :

{T3A058}
[Tsugumi]
It doesn't matter how it tastes.

[Takeshi]
Of course it matters!

[Takeshi]
"I'm doing my best to show you how real 
cookin' tastes!"

[Takeshi]
"You just wait, I'll cook you up a meal that'll 
wake up your taste buds...!"


69 :

{T3A059}
[Tsugumi]
I've had enough to eat, okay?


{T3A060}
[Tsugumi]
I'm full...

[Takeshi]
...Hmph.

[Takeshi]
Well, if you say so.


70 :
BOOOooom!


71 :
Suddenly, a low metallic sound reverberated
throughout the complex.

It was a dull, muffled sound.


72 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what was that!?


{T3A061}
[Tsugumi]
This whole place just shook... a little.

Tsugumi's eyes darted around as if searching
for something.

Moments later, the Kid and £o¢o, who'd both
been resting in another room, appeared.


73 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid, what was that?


{T3A062}
[Kid]
Uh, I don't know...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, this doesn't have anything to do with 
that 'bad feeling' you had earlier, does it?"


74 :
The Kid shook his head.


{T3A063}
[Kid]
I don't know. Maybe we should ask Sora...


{T3A064}
[Sora]
Did you call for me?


75 :
From out of nowhere, Sora appeared in midair
and floated down in front of us.


{T3A065}
[£o¢o]
Ah, hi, Sora-san!

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora! Where were you?


76 :

{T3A066}
[Sora]
I'm terribly sorry. I overslept.

Sora looked embarrassed.

[Takeshi]
Overslept? But you're...

[Takeshi]
...Nah, we'll save that for later.


{T3A067}
[Kid]
"Hey, did something just happen? There was an 
awful noise just now."


77 :

{T3A068}
[Sora]
"One of the shafts that supports this floor 
has started to warp."


{T3A069}
[Kid]
We didn't see any signs of it yesterday...


{T3A070}
[Sora]
"Yes, well, it wasn't in my calculations. It appears
as if the ocean currents may have caused it."

[Takeshi]
How dangerous are we talking here?


78 :

{T3A071}
[Sora]
"Well it should be within the margin of error, 
but... No, wait a second."


79 :

{T3A072}
[Sora]
"There is an anomaly in one of the 
pressure-regulating pipes at Zweiter 
Stock's warehouse."

[Takeshi]
What are pressure-regulating pipes?


{T3A073}
[Sora]
"These pipelines are responsible for adjusting 
the pressure inside the multi-layered 
bulkheads comprising LeMU."


80 :

{T3A074}
[Sora]
"If any of them should rupture, for whatever 
reason, I am incapable of repairing them."


{T3A075}
[Sora]
"The anomaly is only slight, so you shouldn't have to
hurry, but... I think it is best if someone goes to check
on it. Would you please go for me?"

[Takeshi]
Sure, leave it to me.

I volunteered right away.


81 :

{T3A076}
[Tsugumi]
I'll go too.

Unexpectedly, Tsugumi also agreed to go.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi? You sure?


{T3A077}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, if we're going to fix something, we'll 
need tools, right? I know my way around a 
workshop."

[Takeshi]
Alright... Let's go.


82 :

{T3A078}
[£o¢o]
I'll help too!


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

[Takeshi]
"Okay, you can come too, £o¢o... Hey, does 
anyone know where Y¤u went?"

I looked around but didn't see Y¤u anywhere.


83 :

{T3A079}
[Kid]
"She went to the control room when things were 
shaking earlier."


84 :

{T3A080}
[Sora]
We must have just missed each other.


{T3A081}
[Kid]
"I'll go and tell her that you're going up 
above."

[Takeshi]
"Alright, Kid. I'll leave it to you. Keep an 
eye on things from the control room, will 
you? Just to make sure we don't miss 
anything..."


85 :

{T3A082}
[Sora]
If something comes up, use LeMMIH to contact me.


{T3A083}
[Kid]
Alright. See you later!


86 :
Bounding across the water's surface, the Kid
shot down the corridor.


87 :
We climbed the emergency stairs quickly.

We were told that it wasn't urgent, but we
still couldn't afford to be careless.

Tsugumi quietly shouldered the heavy toolbox,
climbing higher and higher.

£o¢o and Pipi followed right behind.

[Takeshi]
By the way, Sora...

I asked Sora, who was gliding alongside me,
something that had been on my mind.


88 :

{T3A084}
[Sora]
Yes, Kuranari-san. What is it?

[Takeshi]
You mention you'd 'overslept' earlier...?


89 :

{T3A085}
[Sora]
Y-yes, I'm sorry...

Sora's face went a deep shade of red.


{T3A086}
[Sora]
"Actually, there was some routine maintenance on 
one of the servers where my data is stored. 
It initiated automatically this morning."


90 :

{T3A087}
[Sora]
"It appears that it took some time for the 
return processing. I was a little too 
optimistic on the preliminary check. I'm 
terribly sorry."

[Takeshi]
Hmm, so that's what it was.

[Takeshi]
...Ahahaha.

I laughed for some reason.


91 :

{T3A088}
[Sora]
Um, er, what... Did I say something amusing?

Sora was confused.

[Takeshi]
"No, I just thought it was funny that even 
YOU could oversleep, Sora."


92 :

{T3A089}
[Sora]
Ahh... That's funny...?

[Takeshi]
How should I put it...? It's cute.


93 :

{T3A090}
[Sora]
'Cute'...!?

[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{T3A091}
[Sora]
Sleeping in is... cute?


{T3A092}
[Sora]
That does not compute...

Sora's eyes went round.

Maybe it was because that particular use of
the word wasn't in her database.


94 :

{T3A093}
[Sora]
I've caused all of you such trouble...

[Takeshi]
Hey, nobody's angry. Don't let it bother you.

[Takeshi]
Everyone knows that you're working hard.


95 :

{T3A094}
[Sora]
Ah, yes. Thank you...

Although Sora looked somewhat puzzled, her
cheeks seemed to glow with joy.

And for some reason, I found that amusing too.


{T3A095}
[Sora]
Really...? Is it...cute...?

I thought it was a charmingly innocent
reaction.

I supposed it was the kind of thing you'd call
'cute'.


96 :
We finally arrived at Zweiter Stock.

Looking around the floor, everything seemed
normal, but we could hear a hissing sound
coming from somewhere.

We walked toward the sound.


97 :
[Takeshi]
Yesterday, everything was fine here.

[Takeshi]
"Why do you think something would go wrong all 
of a sudden?"


{T3A096}
[Sora]
"Well... everything doesn't always go 
according to plan..."


98 :

{T3A097}
[£o¢o]
"Is it because everyone was bouncing around so 
much?"

£o¢o said that casually.


99 :
[Takeshi]
Huh?


100 :

{T3A098}
[£o¢o]
You guys were making such a fuss...


{T3A099}
[£o¢o]
It probably threw LeMU off its axis.

[Takeshi]
I... I don't think so.

[Tsugumi]
.........


101 :

{T3A100}
[Tsugumi]
Haha, maybe it is.

Tsugumi laughed softly.


102 :

{T3A101}
[Tsugumi]
"But if we make some repairs, everything 
should be fine."


{T3A102}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, I guess so. Right, Tsugumin?


{T3A103}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah. Don't worry about it, £o¢o.


103 :

{T3A104}
[£o¢o]
Whew! I'm so relieved~


{T3A105}
[£o¢o]
Woohoo! Alright~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
Rrruff! Rrruff!


104 :
We stood in front of the room where the
hissing sound was coming from.

[Takeshi]
So it is coming from inside the warehouse.


105 :

{T3A106}
[Sora]
"I will run a scan to determine the situation 
inside."


106 :
Saying that, Sora disappeared.

[Takeshi]
"The steam in there isn't going to explode 
if we open the door, right?"

After I asked that, Tsugumi eyed the door
uncertainly.


107 :

{T3A107}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm...


108 :

{T3A108}
[Tsugumi]
It's probably fine.

[Takeshi]
How would you know? Do you...?


109 :

{T3A109}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just saying what you want to hear.


110 :
Sora appeared in front of the door.


111 :

{T3A110}
[Sora]
I have finished the diagnostic.


{T3A111}
[Sora]
"Atmospheric pressure is normal. No traces of 
toxic gas detected; however, the temperature 
and humidity of the room are rising in 
slight increments."


{T3A112}
[Sora]
"An area of the pipe has ruptured, and there 
is a slight water leak. The water is about 
ten centimeters at its deepest point."


112 :

{T3A113}
[Tsugumi]
That's hardly anything at all.


113 :

{T3A114}
[Sora]
No, I suppose not...

[Takeshi]
"Let's go in. If we fix it, there won't be a 
problem, right?"


114 :

{T3A115}
[Sora]
Yes. Please hurry.


115 :
I opened the door.

I looked toward the wall that was making the
hissing sound.

There was a faint crack in the
pressure-regulating pipe, and water was
dancing out of it in a fine mist.

If that was all it was, it didn't seem like we
had anything to worry about.

It seemed like we'd be able to fix it in no
time.

116 :
Tsugumi opened up the toolbox and started
spreading a few tools out in front of her.


117 :
[Takeshi]
What should I do?


{T3A116}
[Tsugumi]
"The pipe is bent a little bit... I'm going to 
clamp a metal sleeve on it. Would you support 
the pipe for me?"

[Takeshi]
Roger that!


118 :

{T3A117}
[£o¢o]
What should I do?


{T3A118}
[Tsugumi]
"On the other side of this... there should be 
a valve attached to this pipe. You see it? I 
want you to loosen that a bit."


119 :

{T3A119}
[£o¢o]
Okaaaay, gotcha!


120 :
We all started working in unison.


121 :
We opened and closed a number of valves,
connected and repaired pipes, and welded shut
cracks...


122 :
[Takeshi]
You seem really used to all this.


123 :

{T3A120}
[Tsugumi]
What do you mean?

[Takeshi]
Welding. Where'd you learn that?


{T3A121}
[Tsugumi]
You want to know?

[Takeshi]
Uh, well, it's just that...


124 :

{T3A122}
[Tsugumi]
"You know, asking meaningless questions is a 
bad habit of yours."


125 :
And after that, I didn't feel I could ask
anything else.

Sora watched us for a while from the side.


126 :
After a while, an intercom in the corner of the
room sounded.


127 :
[Takeshi]
Huh, did someone call?


128 :

{T3A123}
[Sora]
"Excuse me, everyone, but Tanaka-san is calling me.
I must be going."

[Takeshi]
"Okay, go for it. We should be able to handle 
the rest ourselves."


129 :

{T3A124}
[Sora]
Okay. I'll leave the rest to you.


130 :
Sora approached the intercom and disappeared
as if it had sucked her in.


131 :
I knew she could travel instantly, but... it
was still an odd sight.


132 :

{T3A125}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi? Don't just stand there. On to the 
next pipe."

[Takeshi]
Huh? Oh, okay.


133 :

{T3A126}
[Tsugumi]
First, take that blue valve and...

The water underfoot hadn't gone down at all.
Although the drain pump was moving, the
drainage pipe was broken.


{T3A127}
[Tsugumi]
Now twist the red valve...

We'd fixed a number of pipes, but the sound of
escaping steam still hadn't stopped.


{T3A128}
[Tsugumi]
Alright, £o¢o, wait just a bit.


{T3A129}
[£o¢o]
Okay, I'm ready~


134 :

{T3A130}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, turn the valves in the order I told 
you."

[Takeshi]
...


135 :

{T3A131}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, Takeshi, are you listening?

[Takeshi]
"Huh? Yeah, alright, alright. I'm sorry. Blue, 
then red, right?"


{T3A132}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah. Loosen them, then shut them again.


136 :
I set to work on the blue valve in front of me.


I was supposed to loosen it...

(Eh? Which way was I supposed to turn it
again...?)

137 :
{11:0-ac}
{11:1}Clockwise

{11:1}Counterclockwise


138 :
That one went clockwise, right...


139 :
I turned the blue valve with all of my
strength.


140 :
The sound of rushing air grew louder.


141 :
That one went counterclockwise, right...



142 :
I turned the blue valve with all of my
strength.


143 :
The sound of rushing steam grew softer.


144 :
Next, close the red valve...

The next valve was nearby.

145 :
{11:0-ae}
{11:1}Clockwise

{11:1}Counterclockwise


146 :
That one went clockwise, right...


147 :
I turned the red valve.


148 :
The strength of the steam blowing from the pipe
weakened.


149 :
That one went counterclockwise, right...


150 :
I turned the red valve.


151 :
The strength of the steam blowing from the
pipe got stronger.


152 :
(Alright, that does it.)

[Takeshi]
Okay!


{T3A133}
[Tsugumi]
£o¢o, hold on just a little longer.


{T3A134}
[£o¢o]
Okay.


153 :
Holding up her left hand to shield her face,
Tsugumi operated the welding torch with her
right hand.

The crack in the pipe closed visibly.


154 :

{T3A135}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, go support that pipe. It looks like 
it's shaking."

Tsugumi barked the order to me as she was
welding.

[Takeshi]
Okay.

I reached out to touch the pipe that had the
valve I'd just closed.


155 :
[Takeshi]
Ouch!

The pipe was scalding hot, and I pulled my
hand back instinctively.


156 :

{T3A136}
[Tsugumi]
"Huh? That shouldn't be... Did you turn the 
valve the right way?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I think so.


157 :

{T3A137}
[Tsugumi]
That's strange...

[Takeshi]
"Well, we're going to have to support this 
pipe somehow. I'll try to find a cover..."


158 :
I looked around.

And the moment I took my eyes off the pipe...


159 :
Creak, crackle... crack!

[Takeshi]
What?

Turning toward the sound, I could see the pipe
swelling rapidly.


160 :
BOOM!

The cap burst off and flew toward my head.

I pulled back, dodging rapidly.

The flying metal ricocheted off the floor and
came to a stop.

[Takeshi]
That was close... WoooAAH!?


161 :
BAM!


162 :
KA-BOOM!

One after another, metal pipes bent and then
exploded around me.

[Takeshi]
Waaagh!

I panicked and got the hell out of there.

But there were stacks of crates and old
containers in the direction I tried to escape.


163 :

{T3A138}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, after I've finished attaching this, 
return the valve to its original position 
right away."

[Takeshi]
Okay, gotcha.

Tsugumi finished welding.


164 :

{T3A139}
[Tsugumi]
The valve! Hurry!

[Takeshi]
Alright! Geez!


165 :
I quickly turned the valve back in the other
direction.

I could feel the steam flowing through the
valve.


{T3A140}
[Tsugumi]
"£o¢o, this pipe's done. Go on to the next 
one."


{T3A141}
[£o¢o]
Okay, where is it?


{T3A142}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm... Hold on just a second.

The water underfoot still hadn't gone down at
all and was swirling around like a whirlpool.

The air conditioner on the wall was sucking
in water and gurgling it out.


166 :
It appeared it had also shorted out.

I could see blue-white sparks jumping around
inside.

(I hope it doesn't shock me...)

I was starting to get a little scared.


167 :
CRACK!

[Takeshi]
!?

The air conditioner made an awful sound.


168 :
And all of a sudden, muddy water started
overflowing from the exhaust vent.

The area around my legs was quickly getting
grimy.


{T3A143}
[Tsugumi]
"The drainage is starting to backflow, so be 
careful."


169 :
[Takeshi]
Wagh!

My leg got caught up in the jet of muddy
water, and I lost my balance.

I reached out to grab something.

I caught onto a stack of crates and old
containers lying nearby.


170 :
CRASH!


171 :
Although the crates caught my weight, they
shifted and began spilling over.

Countless containers and rusty pipes started
raining down.


172 :
They passed me and headed on a direct course
to hit the wall.

And in their path was‡L

[Takeshi]
£o¢o, watch out!


173 :

{T3A144}
[£o¢o]
Wha...?


{T3A145}
[Tsugumi]
Get back!


174 :
Metal was raining down.

The old pipe broke apart into thousands of
pieces.


175 :
The containers were splintering.


176 :
They all struck the surface of the shallow
water violently.


177 :
The sound of hard, heavy objects falling
echoed in the room.

The whole room quivered.


178 :
A few pipes along the wall had ruptured and
were spewing out water.

And where £o¢o had been sitting only a moment
earlier...


179 :
Tsugumi lay... fallen over.


{T3A146}
[£o¢o]
...!

£o¢o looked around at the spectacle and
hugged Pipi to herself tightly, her hands
trembling.

Just before the metallic objects had crashed
down on £o¢o's back, Tsugumi had thrust her
out of the way.

She'd protected her... while risking her own
life...


180 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!


{T3A147}
[Tsugumi]
Agh...

A metal shard had dug deeply into Tsugumi's
right thigh, and it didn't look like she
could move.

Steam was pouring out of the burst pipes
surrounding us.

And the drainage pump, not doing its job,
continued belching out muddy water in large
quantities.


{T3A148}
[Tsugumi]
I guess I messed up.

Tsugumi grimaced and clasped her thigh
tightly.

She was losing a lot of blood.

The murky water was getting redder by the
moment...

[Takeshi]
Hey, you okay!?


{T3A149}
[Tsugumi]
Heh heh. Does this LOOK okay to you?


{T3A150}
[Tsugumi]
Always asking stupid questions.

[Takeshi]
"S-stop laughing! I'm going to get that stuff 
off you, just wait!"

I hurried through the water to Tsugumi and
tried to lift the metal off of her.

But no matter how hard I tried, the heavy
chunk wouldn't budge.

[Takeshi]
Damn it!


{T3A151}
[Tsugumi]
Looks like it's no use...

In the meantime, the water level had risen
from ankle to knee height.


{T3A152}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumiiin!

£o¢o crawled over to get closer to Tsugumi.


{T3A153}
[Tsugumi]
Get away from me!

Stung by Tsugumi's cold words, £o¢o stiffened
and stopped.


{T3A154}
[Tsugumi]
Get out of here, £o¢o.


{T3A155}
[Tsugumi]
You too, Takeshi. Get out while you can...


{T3A156}
[Tsugumi]
"At this rate, this room's partitions won't 
last."


{T3A157}
[Tsugumi]
You'll both die if you stay.


{T3A158}
[Tsugumi]
So hurry...


{T3A159}
[Tsugumi]
Get out of here.

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
...St‡L

[Takeshi]
"Stupid idiot! You think I can just leave 
you!?"


{T3A160}
[Tsugumi]
"There's nothing you can do, right? I'm stuck 
here."


{T3A161}
[Tsugumi]
"And with this injury, you can't help me 
anyway‡L"

[Takeshi]
Shut up!

I roared out.

[Takeshi]
I won't let you give up on me now, damn it!

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o! What are you standing there for!?


{T3A162}
[£o¢o]
Wah! Y-yes!?

[Takeshi]
Get on that intercom and contact the others!

With all her might, £o¢o moved her trembling
legs to get closer to the intercom.


{T3A163}
[£o¢o]
"It's no use... It's broken! I pushed the 
button, but nothing happened!"

[Takeshi]
"So run up and tell the others to get over 
here!"


{T3A164}
[£o¢o]
O-okay, I'm going!

Although she looked flustered, £o¢o nodded
and ran off.

The door to the warehouse closed.

Soon, water came up to the bottom of the door.


181 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

The water continued to rise.

From her waist down, Tsugumi was almost
completely underwater.

The water level was almost over my knees.


{T3A165}
[Tsugumi]
What are you trying to prove...?


{T3A166}
[Tsugumi]
"It doesn't mean anything... Just leave. I 
don't want you here."

[Takeshi]
I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a reason.

[Takeshi]
I can't just leave you here.


{T3A167}
[Tsugumi]
Why not?

[Takeshi]
"I've taken nothing but abuse from you, and 
you still haven't thanked me properly yet."


{T3A168}
[Tsugumi]
"Oh, really... Heh heh. Well, that's reason 
enough, I suppose."

Tsugumi laughed weakly.

Her lips were trembling.

The murky water was spreading.


{T3A169}
[Tsugumi]
It's gotten cold in here...

[Takeshi]
"Alright, Tsugumi... I need you to stay with me 
now."

I chose my words as carefully as possible.


{T3A170}
[Tsugumi]
I'm perfectly sane.

[Takeshi]
"You'll be okay. The wound isn't that deep, so 
don't worry."


{T3A171}
[Tsugumi]
'You'll be okay'... What makes you think that?


{T3A172}
[Tsugumi]
You're the one who's crazy...

[Takeshi]
"I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I wasn't paying 
attention, and you got hurt..."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


182 :
The water level was rising up to Tsugumi's
head.

A section of the partitioning had broken, and
seawater was rushing in.

The water was ice cold and seemed like it
would freeze us.

The water volume increased mercilessly.

[Tsugumi]
.........

Her face contorted with pain.

In agony, she labored for breath.

There wasn't any time.


183 :
Making up my mind, I dove into the water.

I couldn't open my eyes.

All I could do was search the bottom using my
intuition.

(...AaaaaAAAAGGGH!)

(DAMN IT!)

Using all of my strength, I heaved up the
large mass of metal sticking into Tsugumi's
leg.

Aided slightly by the buoyancy of the water,
the metal hunk moved slightly.

Tsugumi pulled her leg out at once.


184 :
I lifted my face out of the water, gulping
greedily for air.

The flooding wouldn't stop.

The water level was already above my shoulders.


{T3A173}
[Tsugumi]
You are...


{T3A174}
[Tsugumi]
Such a stubborn idiot...

[Takeshi]
Shut up, just keep quiet.

With her leg injured, there was no way
Tsugumi could swim.

Holding onto her, I headed for the exit.

But the door was already underwater.


{T3A175}
[Tsugumi]
Look, there's no way you can save me...

[Takeshi]
I told you to keep quiet!

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"There's got to be another exit. I'll look 
for it."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
It'll be okay. We'll find a way out of this.


{T3A176}
[Tsugumi]
"There you go again, saying 'it'll be 
okay'... You're so irresponsible..."

[Takeshi]
Would you keep quiet!?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

I probably could have forced open the door if
I had tried, but it would have put the second
floor in danger of flooding.

I searched desperately for an emergency exit.

My legs wouldn't touch the floor.

I could hardly breathe.

I was at my limit.

[Takeshi]
...!

[Takeshi]
"There's a ladder! In the corner of the room, 
there's a ladder. We can use it to get to the 
emergency passage."

[Takeshi]
We're going to make it, Tsugumi!


185 :
I swam with all my might to get to the ladder.

With Tsugumi draped over my back, I climbed
up the ladder.


186 :
I opened the flood hatch at the end of the
ladder and pushed Tsugumi through.


187 :
Going up immediately behind her, I quickly
shut the hatch.

The sound of the flood faded away...

But there wasn't time to rest.

Tsugumi was still losing blood.

I took her up on my back and began to run.


188 :
[Takeshi]
Damn, which way should I go...?

A dead end in the passage had me totally lost.


189 :

{T3A177}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san!

Sora appeared suddenly in front of me.

[Takeshi]
Sora! Tsugumi is... Tsugumi is!


190 :

{T3A178}
[Sora]
I know. I heard everything from £o¢o-chan.


{T3A179}
[Sora]
"Bring her to the infirmary immediately. Tanaka-san
is currently preparing to treat her."

[Takeshi]
"Alright, I'm on my way! Now, which way do I 
go?"


{T3A180}
[Sora]
"Return back along this passage, go down the 
stairs on the right, and take the standard 
passage to..."

[Takeshi]
Okay!


191 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
It's okay, it's going to be okay...!

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi groaned painfully from her place on
my back.

Even if she thought it was irresponsible of
me, I couldn't bring myself to tell her, 'It's
no use, it's too late.'

As long as I had even a little hope, I didn't
want to throw it away.


192 :
I burst into the infirmary.

I set the injured Tsugumi down on the bed.

She'd lost so much blood...

We had to take emergency measures immediately.

[Takeshi]
Hey, what are we going to do!?


193 :

{T3A181}
[Y¤u]
Get out of the way!

Y¤u, who'd been waiting in the room, pushed
me aside.

A tourniquet was taken out from a rack of
medical instruments on the wall and fastened
around Tsugumi's thigh.


194 :

{T3A182}
[Y¤u]
This is bad...

[Takeshi]
What's the status? How bad is it?

[Takeshi]
Can't we use that scanner to check it out?

I pointed to the L-MRI.


195 :

{T3A183}
[Y¤u]
It seems to be broken.


{T3A184}
[Sora]
I'll have a look.


196 :
Sora put her hand on Tsugumi. A holographic
window appeared in the air.

A small sensor or camera started moving on
the ceiling.


197 :

{T3A185}
[Sora]
"Well, this is just a bio scan, so I can't 
tell for certain, but..."


198 :

{T3A186}
[Sora]
"Her femur is fractured. And it looks like it 
might be a complex fracture."


{T3A187}
[Sora]
"That, and the artery is severed. She'll need 
sutures."


199 :

{T3A188}
[Y¤u]
"I've stitched up my finger before. It was 
with a survival kit, but..."


200 :

{T3A189}
[Sora]
"Well, Tanaka-san, do you think you can
assist me?"


{T3A190}
[Y¤u]
I'll do my best! Do we have anesthetic?


{T3A191}
[Sora]
"I'll get it ready. The laser scalpel, 
forceps, and sutures... Everything we need is 
already in the room."


201 :
Sora moved the electric wagon and used its
robotic arm to gather the necessary surgical
tools.

Y¤u flipped up Tsugumi's skirt and started
wiping off the wound.


202 :

{T3A192}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari!


{T3A193}
[Y¤u]
Don't stand there! You're in the way!

Y¤u pointed angrily at the exit.

[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah, sorry... Take care of her, okay!?


203 :

{T3A194}
[Y¤u]
Leave it to me!

Y¤u looked determined to show us all what she
was capable of.


204 :
As soon as I left the tense atmosphere of the
emergency room, my fatigue hit me.

[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...

I set myself down on a nearby chair.


205 :

{T3A195}
[£o¢o]
Oh, Takepyon... Is Tsugumin going to be...?

£o¢o was gripping Pipi but looked as if
she was having a hard time relaxing.

[Takeshi]
"You let them know right away, so... she should 
be fine."


206 :

{T3A196}
[£o¢o]
Really...?

£o¢o's eyes were moist.

It was hard to tell, but she had probably
been crying moments earlier.

Even still, she tried to smile.


207 :

{T3A197}
[£o¢o]
Hey, you think Tsugumin's...


{T3A198}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin's... gonna be okay, right?

Still looking worried, she tilted her head as
she asked me.

[Takeshi]
Yeah. She'll be fine.

[Takeshi]
Absolutely fine...

I closed my hand into a fist...

And told myself.

She's going to be okay.


208 :
After what seemed like an eternity, Y¤u
appeared from the infirmary with Sora.

The surgery was over‡L

Tsugumi was going to live.


209 :

{T3A199}
[Sora]
"It required a total of 40 stitches and will 
take two months to heal completely."


{T3A200}
[Sora]
"And it will take her a few more months to be 
able to walk normally..."


{T3A201}
[Sora]
"Until a rescue team arrives at LeMU and we 
can get her out of here, she's going to have 
to rest."

[Takeshi]
Alright. Thanks, Sora.

[Takeshi]
And... good job, Y¤u.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
Y¤u? What's wrong?


210 :

{T3A202}
[Y¤u]
...What?


211 :

{T3A203}
[Y¤u]
"Oh... Um, nothing, I'm just really tired... You 
know..."


{T3A204}
[Y¤u]
"I've never done an operation like that 
before..."

After that, Y¤u looked down and didn't say much.


212 :

{T3A205}
[Sora]
"By the way, it looks like the flooding 
stopped in the Zweiter Stock warehouse."


{T3A901}
[Sora]
"All pipelines connecting to the warehouse
have been closed as an emergency measure, and
the whole area has been sealed off from
Zweiter."

{T3A902}
[Sora]
"So we don't have to worry about the 
flood damage expanding."

{T3A207}
[Sora]
That's it, then.
