1 :
It was nighttime.

But deep below the ocean's surface, it was only
slightly darker than before.

Fortunately, the damage to LeMU hadn't
worsened.

We had a light dinner at the tuna sandwich
shop and gathered in the conference room.


2 :
[Takeshi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C240}
[Y¤u]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C241}
[Kid]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C242}
[Tsugumi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{T2C243}
[Sora]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...

My yawn was contagious.


3 :

{T2C244}
[£o¢o]
Still...


4 :

{T2C245}
[£o¢o]
Everybody looks so sleepy...

[Takeshi]
Well... There's really nothing to do.

The only person that seemed completely awake
was £o¢o.


5 :
Everyone else was slouched in chairs, just
spacing out.

There was no impending danger. No new
developments.

The situation we were in remained unchanged,
and it somehow felt as though time had stopped.


6 :

{T2C246}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, you're such a slob...

Y¤u said that in a tired-sounding voice.


7 :

{T2C247}
[Y¤u]
And stop dawdling...

[Takeshi]
"But there's no reason to go wandering 
around the complex now, right?"

[Takeshi]
"We're just... gonna have to wait for 
help to come anyway, right?"


{T2C248}
[Y¤u]
Yeah... I suppose...


{T2C249}
[Y¤u]
Alright... I'm off for a little bit...

Rubbing her shoulders, Y¤u stood up.


8 :

{T2C250}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Nakkyu, are you going somewhere?


9 :

{T2C251}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. Nowhere in particular. Just a walk...


10 :

{T2C252}
[Y¤u]
I've got to move around or I'll get tired...


11 :

{T2C253}
[£o¢o]
Oh! I know, let's run a race!

£o¢o's eyes lit up.


{T2C254}
[Y¤u]
A race...?


12 :

{T2C255}
[£o¢o]
You don't want to...?


{T2C256}
[Y¤u]
No, I didn't say that.

Y¤u made a face, but she didn't seem to be
in a bad mood.


13 :

{T2C257}
[£o¢o]
Then, then, how about tag!?


14 :

{T2C258}
[Y¤u]
Okay. I'm in.


{T2C259}
[Y¤u]
"But tag with two people doesn't sound very 
fun."


15 :

{T2C260}
[Kid]
Want me to play?

The Kid stood up.


16 :

{T2C261}
[Sora]
May I participate as well?

Sora approached £o¢o and the others.


17 :

{T2C262}
[£o¢o]
Yeah! Let's play together~


{T2C263}
[Sora]
Yes please.


18 :

{T2C264}
[Kid]
Alright! I'm gonna win!

I couldn't tell why, but everyone was excited
to play.

I supposed everyone was bored...


19 :

{T2C265}
[Y¤u]
Hey, where do you wanna play?


20 :

{T2C266}
[£o¢o]
Hmmm. How about... in this room?

£o¢o looked around the conference room.


21 :
I surveyed it too.

Tsugumi sat alone with an annoyed expression
on her face.


22 :

{T2C267}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...


{T2C268}
[Tsugumi]
You never shut up...

She lazily stood from her chair and walked
briskly to the corner of the room...


23 :
And flipped off the light switch.

Tsugumi returned to her seat and slowly sat
down again.


24 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you thinking? It's dark.


{T2C269}
[Tsugumi]
It was too bright for me to relax.


{T2C270}
[Tsugumi]
Some people want to rest...

[Takeshi]
"Well, that doesn't mean you just go turning 
off the lights!"

[Takeshi]
Just because YOU want to rest...


{T2C271}
[Tsugumi]
What about you?

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T2C272}
[Tsugumi]
Don't you want to rest...?

[Takeshi]
No, I... I'm...


{T2C273}
[Kid]
Oh yeah. Hey, Takeshi, you wanna play tag?

(Tag, huh...?)

25 :
{11:0-a3}
{11:1}I'll pass

{11:1}I'm in


26 :
[Takeshi]
Nah, I think I'll pass.

[Takeshi]
"I wanna rest like Tsugumi said... I think 
I'll hold off for now."

[Takeshi]
"Once you get older like me, tag takes its 
toll on your body."


{T2C274}
[Y¤u]
Hmph. Older, huh...?


{T2C275}
[Y¤u]
Well, you must be older than you look.

[Takeshi]
...What?


{T2C276}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah, and besides, Kuranari doesn't seem too 
sharp anyway."


{T2C277}
[Y¤u]
I'll bet he'd be caught right away.


27 :
[Takeshi]
You don't know what you're talkin' 'bout!

I stood up energetically.


{T2C278}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, does that mean Kuranari wants to plaaaay 
now?"


{T2C279}
[£o¢o]
Come on, Takepyon! It'll be fun~

[Takeshi]
Wait a sec! I didn't say that I'm playin'!


{T2C280}
[Kid]
Oh, you're not going to play?


{T2C281}
[Y¤u]
"Surrendering without a fight? Sounds like a 
chicken to me."

[Takeshi]
...Alright, alright! I'll play your dumb game!

I was overruled by the majority.

Well, I figured it was better than sitting
there doing nothing...

I was playing, but I wasn't happy about it.


28 :
It all sounded childish to me...

[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose...

[Takeshi]
"Just sitting around here doing nothing would 
get kinda boring..."


29 :
[Takeshi]
Alright! I'm in!

I stood up energetically.


{T2C282}
[Y¤u]
Oh, does that mean Kuranari wants to plaaaay?


{T2C283}
[£o¢o]
Roger that~


30 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi glanced at me out of the corner of
her eye and then looked away.


{T2C284}
[Kid]
...Should we leave the lights off?

The Kid whispered this to me.

[Takeshi]
"The emergency lights are on, but it's kinda 
dark. You okay with that?"


{T2C285}
[Kid]
Let's respect Tsugumi's wishes.

[Takeshi]
But this doesn't seem like tag at all...


31 :

{T2C286}
[£o¢o]
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo!


{T2C287}
[£o¢o]
Give me a flashlight to go!


32 :
£o¢o pulled out a flashlight as she recited
the rhyme.


33 :

{T2C288}
[£o¢o]
"How about 'kick the can' instead? It's also
fun, don't you think?"

£o¢o lit up her face with the flashlight from
under her chin trying to get everyone to agree.

[Takeshi]
Kick the can?


{T2C289}
[Sora]
What is kick the can?


{T2C290}
[£o¢o]
Um... It's... Um...


{T2C291}
[£o¢o]
"You pick someone to be 'it' in a dark place. 
Then everyone hides..."

[Takeshi]
Hey, that's just hide and seek tag.


34 :

{T2C292}
[£o¢o]
No it's not! Listen!

[Takeshi]
Oh, sorry...


35 :

{T2C293}
[£o¢o]
"The person that's 'it' puts a can somewhere 
in the room..."


{T2C294}
[£o¢o]
"And the people that hide try to kick the can 
before the person that's 'it' finds them."


{T2C295}
[£o¢o]
"If a person kicks the can, then he or she 
wins."


{T2C296}
[£o¢o]
"If the person that's 'it' finds somebody and 
steps on the can while calling out his or her 
name..."


{T2C297}
[£o¢o]
"Then the found person can't kick the can 
anymore and loses."


36 :

{T2C298}
[Y¤u]
Oh, so that's a kind of 'hide and seek', right?

[Takeshi]
Oh, well, everybody knows how to play that.


37 :

{T2C299}
[£o¢o]
No, it's kick the can.


38 :

{T2C300}
[Y¤u]
That's a glorified kind of hide and seek.


39 :

{T2C301}
[£o¢o]
It's kick the can!


40 :

{T2C302}
[£o¢o]
KIIICK THEEE CAAAN!

[Takeshi]
Anyway, who cares about the name? Let's play.


41 :

{T2C303}
[Tsugumi]
...Geez.

As we were getting all pumped for the game,
Tsugumi let out a sigh.


42 :

{T2C304}
[Tsugumi]
You are SO noisy...


43 :
Tsugumi quietly stood up and walked to the
far exit, leaving the room.


44 :

{T2C305}
[Kid]
Is Tsugumi mad?

[Takeshi]
Who knows? Anyway...

[Takeshi]
She'll come back after a while. You'll see.


45 :
After that...

We decided who was 'it' using rock, paper,
scissors.


46 :

{T2C306}
[£o¢o]
Ready, go!


{T2C307}
[£o¢o]
Ready, go!


{T2C308}
[£o¢o]
Ready, go!

[Takeshi]
Damn. I lost!


47 :

{T2C309}
[Y¤u]
Alright. So Kuranari is 'it' first.


{T2C310}
[£o¢o]
Oh, goodie~


{T2C311}
[Sora]
Good luck.

Everyone was grinning at me. Damn.


48 :

{T2C312}
[Kid]
Here you go, Takeshi.

The Kid handed me the empty can.


49 :

{T2C313}
[Y¤u]
"You can hide anywhere as long as it's on 
the third floor. Alright, everyone, let's hide!"


{T2C314}
[Y¤u]
Ready...

[Takeshi]
W-wait a sec!

I held up a hand, hurriedly stopping Y¤u from
sending everyone off.


50 :
[Takeshi]
Y¤u, what did you just say?


{T2C315}
[Y¤u]
Let's hide.

[Takeshi]
No. Before that.


51 :

{T2C316}
[Y¤u]
You can hide anywhere on the third floor.

[Takeshi]
...Are you serious?

[Takeshi]
Not just the conference room?


{T2C317}
[Y¤u]
"This room is too small. And there aren't 
that many places to hide."

[Takeshi]
But the WHOLE third floor?


52 :

{T2C318}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, of course the areas that can't be reached
by walking from here are off limits. Same for 
the emergency corridors and stairs."

[Takeshi]
That's still too big!

[Takeshi]
"It's not fair to the person that's 'it'. 
While he's looking for one person, someone 
else will definitely kick the can."


53 :

{T2C319}
[Y¤u]
I think it's fine.

[Takeshi]
"It's not fine. The game won't work. This is 
a MAJOR problem."


{T2C320}
[Y¤u]
Gosh. You sure complain a lot.


54 :

{T2C321}
[Sora]
"Well, he would certainly appear to be at a 
disadvantage..."


55 :

{T2C322}
[Sora]
"I will dim the lights on the third 
floor... but in return, I will make it so that 
sounds carry better."


{T2C323}
[Sora]
"If sounds carry, then you can hear when 
someone moves across a corridor with water. 
That will give the person who is 'it' an 
advantage."


{T2C324}
[Sora]
"And I will make it so that you know when 
people are moving. I will synthesize 
footsteps and play the sound on the voice 
converters."

[Takeshi]
Okay, sounds good.


56 :

{T2C325}
[Sora]
"Oh, but... what should I do if I should get 
to the can first?"


{T2C326}
[Kid]
Huh? Oh...

[Takeshi]
That's right. You can't kick the can!

We'd only just noticed. If we played tag,
we would have to ban Sora from
jumping about as an image...


57 :

{T2C327}
[£o¢o]
Then you can be with me, Sora-san.


{T2C328}
[£o¢o]
"We'll make it so that Sora-san and I have to be 
within a meter of each other when we hide or 
when we are 'it'."


{T2C329}
[£o¢o]
"In that case, I'll kick the can for the both
of us."


58 :

{T2C330}
[£o¢o]
Okay? Let's try that.


59 :

{T2C331}
[Sora]
Okay. Thanks.


60 :
On top of that, we made Sora promise not to
use the bio scan or LeMU to monitor the
location of anyone.


{T2C332}
[Kid]
Yeah, that makes it fair then.


{T2C333}
[Y¤u]
Alright. All set.

It looked like everyone was ready.


61 :
I took the can, closed my eyes, and counted to
100 in the conference room.

During that time, the others scattered
throughout the third floor.


62 :
[Takeshi]
O-n-e h-u-n-d-r-e-d...

I opened my eyes.

I put the can by my feet.

I looked around in the dim light. There was
no one around.

(I guess I'll have to go look...)

I faced the nearby door.

My footsteps reverbated, producing an
unnaturally deep sound.


It was kind of like how I imagined sonar
would sound.

(I see... So this is what Sora meant by
'making the sound carry better'...)

I felt like I was in a submarine.

I thought that I'd have to pay attention to which
sounds were mine and which were others'.


63 :
All of the lights were off, but the doors
opened automatically.

First, I thought I would head for the...

64 :
{11:0-a5}
{11:1}Central control room

{11:1}Elevator hall


65 :
I decided to hit the control room.


66 :
The monitors in the room were off and the
room only dimly lit.

The computers weren't moving.

I peeked into the lockers and under the
desks, but no one was there.

Well... I figured no one would want to hide in
a place that would be cramped and hard to get
out of.

I gave up looking any more thoroughly and
left the room.


67 :
I thought about where I should go next...


68 :
The elevator hall was one idea.


69 :
But the elevator wasn't moving.

I was sure no one would be there...

But... that might have been exactly what someone
was hoping I would think.


70 :
I entered the elevator hall.

But there was really no place for anyone to
hide.

I checked along the walls, but there wasn't
anyone there.

All of the elevators were stopped, and there
was no sign of anything moving.

(Maybe I should ignore this area...)


71 :
I thought about where I should go next...


72 :
The central control room was one idea.



73 :
[Takeshi]
Oh!

Just then, I heard a sound.

Someone was running along the corridor.

The footsteps were heading toward the
conference room from the Lemurian Ruins.

[Takeshi]
Oh no!

I rushed back the way I'd come.


74 :
[Takeshi]
Who is that?


{T2C334}
[Kid]
Oops!

When I shouted, the moving person flinched.


75 :
The person I found at the corner was the Kid.

I didn't know if he had given up because I
ran after him, but he had stopped in the
corridor.


76 :

{T2C335}
[Kid]
Oh no. You caught me... Am I the first one?

[Takeshi]
Yup.


77 :

{T2C336}
[Kid]
"Dang. That means if you catch everyone, then 
I'm 'it' next?"

[Takeshi]
I reckon so.


{T2C337}
[Kid]
I wonder if someone will show up to help me.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C338}
[Kid]
"Takeshi, if you don't go step on the can, 
then I'll go kick it."

[Takeshi]
You sure know your kick the can rules.


78 :

{T2C339}
[Y¤u]
Whack!


79 :
Crash!


80 :
[Takeshi]
Umpphh!


81 :
Splash!


82 :
Suddenly, Y¤u came flying from the side and
completely cold-cocked me with a jumping chop
to the neck.


83 :
[Takeshi]
*Gurgle*, *gurgle*...

My head went underwater.

My mouth filled with saltwater.


84 :

{T2C340}
[Y¤u]
NYAHAHAHA~

Y¤u was pointing at me in the water and
cackling crazily.

[Takeshi]
*Cough*, *cough*... pwahh!


85 :
Floundering about in the water, I stood up.

[Takeshi]
H-hey, you!


86 :

{T2C341}
[Y¤u]
Heehee... I won this battle!


87 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, stop messing around! Wait!


88 :

{T2C342}
[Y¤u]
Wait for you to catch me? No thanks!

[Takeshi]
"Hey, you! I'll get you back for that! Just 
you wait!"

I took off in a mad dash after Y¤u.

Y¤u disappeared into the conference room.

She tried to close the door before I got
there, but I made it in first.


89 :
Alright!

Y¤u couldn't find the can and was wandering
about.


90 :
I ran by Y¤u...


91 :
I caught sight of the can and slid into it!


I put the can under my foot and declared.

[Takeshi]
I found Y¤u! I stomped on the can!

Soon after that, the Kid came in.

[Takeshi]
I found the Kid! I stomped on the can!

...I continued my declaration.

[Takeshi]
"Hahaha! Did you really think you could 
outwit me?"


92 :

{T2C343}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari, you cheater! You changed the place of 
the can!"

[Takeshi]
"Nobody said where we had to put the can, 
right? Besides, you smacked me, so I figure 
we're even."


{T2C344}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright. Whatever. Anyway, so I'm 
the first person you caught?"

[Takeshi]
You got it.


93 :

{T2C345}
[Y¤u]
Well, that plan sure was a failure...

[Takeshi]
...Huh? What plan?


94 :
As they were talking, the sound of
splashing footsteps could be heard
approaching the door...


95 :

{T2C346}
[£o¢o]
Heeellllloooo~

[Takeshi]
I found Sora and £o¢o and Pipi.


96 :
I stepped on the can.


97 :

{T2C347}
[Sora]
Oh, did you get beaten here, Tanaka-san?


{T2C348}
[Y¤u]
Things didn't quite work out as planned.


{T2C349}
[£o¢o]
"Nakkyu, don't you think you jumped the gun 
just a little bit?"


98 :

{T2C350}
[Kid]
You said we would all charge together.


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

[Takeshi]
So that was your plan...


99 :

{T2C351}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. I thought if we all went for the can 
at once, you wouldn't be able to stop us."

[Takeshi]
That's pretty dirty.


100 :

{T2C352}
[Y¤u]
Ehehehehe~

Y¤u laughed mischievously and with a hint of
embarrassment.


101 :
We gathered in the center of the room.

[Takeshi]
"Well, finding all of you was easier than I 
thought..."

[Takeshi]
"First of all, mob-style kicking of the can is 
definitely not allowed."


102 :

{T2C353}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Why?

[Takeshi]
"You think I can stop you if you all come 
attack at once?"


103 :

{T2C354}
[Y¤u]
Impossible.

[Takeshi]
That's why. It takes all the fun out of it.

[Takeshi]
"Timing your rush just right, waiting for the 
person who is 'it' to go searching... All of 
that would disappear from the game."


104 :

{T2C355}
[Y¤u]
Well, alright...

Y¤u reluctantly agreed to be 'it' the next
time.

I thought that maybe she was used to
hand-to-hand, full-contact battles of kick
the can.


105 :
[Takeshi]
Alright. Everybody good with that?

Sora, £o¢o, the Kid, and Pipi‡Leveryone nodded.

[Takeshi]
Okay then. Y¤u is 'it' next.

[Takeshi]
"The can is over there, so you get it. 
Put it where you want and count‡L"


106 :
Kabing!


107 :
Clatter, clatter, clatter...

The sound of a can being kicked rang out in
the darkness.

The can went rolling powerfully toward the
corridor.

[Takeshi]
Hey! Who kicked that?


108 :

{T2C356}
[Y¤u]
It wasn't me!


109 :
As soon as she got that out of her mouth, Y¤u
started to run away.

[Takeshi]
You scoundrel...!


110 :
Everyone scattered like scared butterflies.


111 :
The splashing sound of footsteps echoed as
they receded down the corridor.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Geez. This means I gotta be 'it' again!

No one responded.

I looked around the room.

No one was left.

(...Huh?)

(I wonder if... Tsugumi kicked the can.)

Despite what she said, Tsugumi was probably
playing on the sly.

(She should've said so then...)

(Oh well...)

[Takeshi]
Alright. I'm counting to a hundred. O-n-e...

[Takeshi]
T-e-n, e-l-e-v-e-n, o-n-e-h-u-n-d-r-e-d...

[Takeshi]
Here I go.


112 :
(I'm gonna get all of you...)

I thought about where I should start looking.

113 :
{11:0-a7}
{11:2-d0}Lemurian Ruins

{11:2-d1}Rest area

{11:2-d2}Tuna sandwich stand


114 :
I stood in front of the Lemurian Ruins.

The lights inside the attraction were off.


Apparently the inside was like a maze.

(I wonder if somebody's hiding in the maze...)

I thought about going in, but inside was even
darker than the room.

Even if I did go in, coming back out would
have been a royal pain.

Getting out of there looked a lot more
difficult than going in...

I figured it was silly to take the risk and
go look in there.

I took a look around the perimeter and didn't
see anyone.

I strained to listen.

I didn't hear anything...


115 :
[Takeshi]
Whoa!

Suddenly, I heard music from within the
attraction.

I thought it might be the attraction's song.

Mixed in with the music was the sound of
someone running away.

[Takeshi]
Stop right there, Y¤u!

I ran to block the exit, moving in the direction I
thought the footsteps were heading.


116 :
[Takeshi]
I knew it...


117 :

{T2C357}
[Y¤u]
Hey, how'd you know it was me?

[Takeshi]
"It's the same trick you used to scare me 
with the Dolphin Carousel before. I 
don't fall for the same trick twice."


118 :

{T2C358}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, that's right! I forgot I'd already done 
that..."

[Takeshi]
"You're not going to try to tackle me now 
that I've got you, are you?"


119 :

{T2C359}
[Y¤u]
"Ah, you knew I was going to do that, too? 
Dang. Ahaha..."

[Takeshi]
I can read you like a book!

She was the kind of person that was mostly
transparent once you knew what they were about.


120 :

{T2C360}
[Y¤u]
Alright. You got me. I give up.

Y¤u held up her hands. I reckoned she knew she
couldn't squeeze by me.

She'd given up on getting to the can.


121 :
She walked behind me with her hands in the air.


122 :
{1}

{16:0}<I found Y¤u. I stepped on the can>{16:1}


123 :
I thought I'd check some other rooms.

124 :
I visited the rest area.

I soon noticed that there was someone there.


125 :
I could hear the sound of someone walking
through water.

As I got closer, the direction of the
footsteps changed.

It was someone short and moving slowly...


It was a battle of patience...


126 :
Splash, splash...

My opponent's feet made a dash for the exit.

I circled around to the side again and again
to block off the person.


127 :
The footsteps gradually moved away from the
exit into a corner.

I moved a little bit closer.

I had a hunch whoever it was would make a
break for it...

I moved to head them off and prepared to trip
them by catching their leg!


128 :
Splash!

I heard someone fall spectacularly.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, I dunno who you are, but are you 
alright?"

[???]
.........

I thought I was near where the person had
stumbled.

But it was dark and I couldn't see much.

[Takeshi]
I wonder if this might work...

I took my PDA from my pocket and set the
monitor backlight on maximum brightness.

But it was weak and nothing compared to a
flashlight.

I thought it might be brighter, but it was
dim and didn't amount to much.


129 :
[Takeshi]
Oooops!

My hand slipped. My PDA looked like it was
headed for the water.


130 :
I snatched it right before it hit the water's
surface.

[Takeshi]
...Huh?

I glimpsed something reflected on the water's
surface, moving...

The biggest 'fish' I'd ever seen started sliding
away in the water...

[Takeshi]
Hey, if it ain't the Kid!


131 :
I scooped up a handful of seawater from
around my feet and dumped it on his head.


{T2C361}
[Kid]
Oh no! You found me!


132 :
Splaaaaaash!

As soon as the Kid stood up, he tried to get
away.


133 :

{T2C362}
[Kid]
Ahhhhh...

But he had a hood on and...


134 :
That hood was filled with water...


135 :
Splash!

The weight of the hood dragged him backward
as he kicked his legs into the air. He fell back
into the water once again.

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C363}
[Kid]
Hey, this feels pretty good.

The Kid swam a kind of breaststroke in the
small pool of water fifteen centimeters deep.

[Takeshi]
Is the water cold?


{T2C364}
[Kid]
A bit...

He glided along, enjoying himself.

That was probably what people meant by
'taking to water like a fish'.

In the darkness, he swam to the other side of
the room...

[Takeshi]
"Hey, just so you know, that exit is the long 
way around."


136 :

{T2C365}
[Kid]
Huh? Read my mind?

The Kid gave up and stood.


137 :

{T2C366}
[Kid]
"I thought you wouldn't see me if I was in 
the water."

He laughed as he said it.

[Takeshi]
"Keeping me on my toes. You're like a ninja or 
something."

[Kid]
.........


138 :

{T2C367}
[Kid]
Nin! Nin! Ninja!

The Kid took some kind of ninja pose.

[Takeshi]
.........


139 :
He jumped in the water again and swam some
more.


140 :
{1}

{16:0}<I found the Kid. I stepped on the can.>{16:1}


141 :
I thought I'd check some other rooms.

142 :
I arrived at the tuna sandwich shop.

The area was dark, but it still smelled
delicious.

(Dang, I'm hungry...)

(Maybe I'll just stop for a bite...)

I reached for some of the sandwiches packaged
and lined up on the counter.

I took off the wrapping and took a bite.

[Takeshi]
Ouch... That's hard!

[Takeshi]
Oh... It's a display model...

I had taken a bite of a wax sample and it was
tasteless.

There was no way I was eating that.

(Oh well...)

I went around to the back of the shop and went
inside.

I thought I'd make myself a fried tuna sandwich.

The light inside the shop was dim.

But since I'd been appointed chairman of the
breakfast committee that morning, I knew
exactly where the food and cooking equipment
were.

I stooped over to open the fridge by my feet.

[Takeshi]
"There should still be loads of food in 
here..."

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Something was there sticking out beside the
fridge.

A hand.

It was a pair of white hands. I'd seen them
before.

Above them was a face I'd seen before.

She was looking around nervously.


143 :
[Takeshi]
Hey... What're you doing?


144 :

{T2C368}
[Sora]
Eh? Kyaaaaaaaa!

I guessed she hadn't noticed me.

Looking up and seeing me, she stiffened.

She seemed flustered, her mouth agape and eyes
looking around desperately.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C369}
[Sora]
Uhhhh... I, um....


145 :

{T2C370}
[Sora]
W-welcome... to our restaurant!

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Bent over awkwardly, Sora shifted gears and
suddenly shot me a smile.


{T2C371}
[Sora]
Oh, another customer? What'll you have?


{T2C372}
[Sora]
What can I get you today?

[Takeshi]
I'll take a fried tuna sandwich.

[Takeshi]
"But I'm pretty sure that's all you've got 
anyway..."


{T2C373}
[Sora]
Oh? Is that right... I'll get right on it.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C374}
[Sora]
Uh... And would you like a drink with that?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C375}
[Sora]
...Let's see...

[Takeshi]
"Sora, I'm amazed that you were obeying the 
rules of the game so strictly."

[Takeshi]
"I thought maybe you'd vanished somewhere or 
gone off where I couldn't find you."


146 :

{T2C376}
[Sora]
"But that would ruin the game, wouldn't it? I 
play by the rules."

[Takeshi]
I know... but still.

[Takeshi]
"If you're going through the trouble of hiding, you 
should try to hide a little better."

Sora had simply squatted down and covered her
head.


{T2C377}
[Sora]
"Is that right? I didn't think I would be 
that easy to find..."


{T2C378}
[Sora]
"Well, since you've found me, there's not much 
I can do about it."

I took some bread out of the fridge for a
sandwich.

[Takeshi]
*Munch*, *munch*...


{T2C379}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, I'm not out until you step on the 
can."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I know.


147 :

{T2C380}
[Sora]
"Don't you think this is not the time to be 
eating bread...?"

[Takeshi]
No, it's okay.

[Takeshi]
"With you here, it means that £o¢o is around 
here also, right?"


{T2C381}
[Sora]
Uh, yes.

[Takeshi]
"Don't worry. I'll hound her out after I 
finish this."

[Takeshi]
*Bow-wow*!


148 :
Bang, bang! I pounded on the stainless steel
kitchen counter.

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
"I know you're hiding in the back of the shop 
already."

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Well, if that's where you wanna be, that's 
fine..."

[Takeshi]
If you aren't there, then tell me.


{T2C382}
[£o¢o]
I'm not~


{T2C383}
[Sora]
£o¢o-chan. If you talk, he will find you.


{T2C384}
[£o¢o]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
"Girl, you fell for the oldest trick in the 
book."


{T2C385}
[£o¢o]
...Ooooops~

£o¢o and Pipi came out from under the counter
together.


149 :
{1}

{16:0}<I found Sora, £o¢o, and Pipi.{1}
I stepped on the can.>{16:1}


150 :
I thought I'd check some other rooms.

151 :
Just like that, I rounded up everyone, stepped on
the can, and ended the game.

Only Tsugumi was left...


152 :
[Takeshi]
Whhhhaaaaat?

I looked around outside the room and was
surprised.


153 :
Tsugumi was sitting calmly in a chair, waiting.

[Takeshi]
I found TSUGUMI!


154 :

{T2C386}
[Tsugumi]
...Eh?

[Takeshi]
Don't play dumb with me.


{T2C387}
[Tsugumi]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

[Takeshi]
"Heh heh. I know better than that. You're 
playing dumb. I know it."


{T2C388}
[Tsugumi]
Dumb?

[Takeshi]
You're the one who kicked the can, right?


{T2C389}
[Tsugumi]
Can?


{T2C390}
[Tsugumi]
What... are you talking about?


155 :
Tsugumi stood up.

I jumped. If Tsugumi kicked the can first, I
thought I'd lose.


156 :
I frantically ran to where the can was.

[Takeshi]
I found Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
I stepped on the can.

[Takeshi]
Huh? What's...?


157 :

{T2C391}
[Tsugumi]
Geez...


{T2C392}
[Tsugumi]
What're you doing, Takeshi...?


158 :
[Takeshi]
Whoa, what?

My foot was searching for the can, but found
only space.

[Takeshi]
The can is gone!

I squinted, scouring the area around me.

The can shined in the emergency lights,
dimly visible in a corner of the room.

[Takeshi]
"Hey! Once you've been caught, 
it's against the rules to kick the can!"

I shouted that into the darkness, but
everyone had already run away.


159 :
There was nothing I could do. I was 'it'
again. I had to go search.

The Kid, Y¤u, £o¢o, Pipi, Sora...

I knew they couldn't have gone far and
thought I'd find them quickly.

Tsugumi stayed around in the conference room.
It didn't look like she felt like going
anywhere.

Just to be safe, I got everyone and stepped
on the can again.

The next time, nobody kicked the can...


160 :
[Takeshi]
This time, the Kid is 'it'.


{T2C393}
[Kid]
Alright. So I count to 100, right?

The Kid took the can and sat in the chair
with his face down.


161 :

{T2C394}
[Kid]
Alright, here I go...


{T2C395}
[Kid]
O-n-e, t-w-o, t-h-r-e-e...

We left the conference room, running around the
floor.


162 :
£o¢o, Pipi, and Sora vanished down the corridor
amidst the sound of splashing.


163 :
Y¤u approached me.


164 :

{T2C396}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, whaddya say we work together?

[Takeshi]
"Huh? Ganging up is against the rules. I 
think I'll pass."


165 :

{T2C397}
[Y¤u]
Don't be so stubborn...


166 :
[Takeshi]
Why did you approach me?


{T2C398}
[Y¤u]
"We just happened to be going in the same 
direction. That's all."

[Takeshi]
I see...


{T2C399}
[Y¤u]
I wonder if here would be safe.

[Takeshi]
"The bathroom could be against the rules. 
It's not a good idea."


167 :

{T2C400}
[Y¤u]
...Oh... And this way's a dead end, huh?

[Takeshi]
Let's go back.


168 :
[Takeshi]
I wonder if we still have time...

I strained my ears to listen.


{T2C401}
[Kid]
"...t-h-i-r-t-y-f-o-u-r, 
t-h-i-r-t-y-f-i-v-e..."

I could faintly hear the Kid counting.

[Takeshi]
It seems like we've still got some time.


169 :

{T2C402}
[Y¤u]
"I think it would have been more fun if we 
had made the emergency corridors part of the 
game."

[Takeshi]
That would make searching a hassle.


{T2C403}
[Y¤u]
"But there are only a few routes to the 
conference room, so it's kind of boring..."

[Takeshi]
"Well, that's because you run around so 
loudly that anyone can hear you coming a kilometer 
away."


170 :

{T2C404}
[Y¤u]
Oh, thanks a lot...


171 :

{T2C405}
[Y¤u]
Hey, wait! Be quiet.


{T2C406}
[Kid]
...f-i-f-t-y-o-n-e, f-i-f-t-y-t-w-o...

We could still hear counting.


172 :
[Takeshi]
Let's find somewhere to hide.


{T2C407}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


173 :
We ended up at the Lemurian Ruins.


174 :

{T2C408}
[Y¤u]
You wanna go in the ruins?

[Takeshi]
"The maze? Getting out will probably be a 
pain, but..."


{T2C409}
[Y¤u]
Don't say that...


175 :
Y¤u pushed me toward the entrance of the ruins.


176 :
I peered into the attraction.

But the inside was dark, as if it had been painted
pitch black. I couldn't see a thing.


{T2C410}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that might be too dark...


{T2C411}
[Y¤u]
The lights and emergency lights are both off.

I strained, looking into the darkness.

It looked as if the darkness went on forever.

[Takeshi]
"Heading in there like this would be 
reckless... Huh?"

Something moved in the darkness.


177 :
A person appeared from the ruins.


178 :
[Takeshi]
You were in there, Tsugumi?


179 :

{T2C412}
[Tsugumi]
Yes. I took a look around.


{T2C413}
[Tsugumi]
It's completely dark. You'd best not go in.

[Takeshi]
Completely dark, huh...?

[Tsugumi]
.........


180 :
Tsugumi left us.

Looking tired, Tsugumi kicked the water under
her feet lightly.


181 :
And I heard the sound of something click in
her hand...

It was a sound I'd heard before...

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, did you take the flashlight?


182 :

{T2C414}
[Y¤u]
It'd be impossible to walk inside without it.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T2C415}
[£o¢o]
HEY! HEY!


183 :
£o¢o came running and splashing up with Sora
in tow.


184 :

{T2C416}
[£o¢o]
So this is where everybody was?


{T2C417}
[Y¤u]
Hey.

[Takeshi]
It's £o¢o and Sora. Welcome.

[Takeshi]
"...But if we're supposed to be hiding, 
clumping up like this isn't too bright, is it?"


185 :

{T2C418}
[£o¢o]
Oh, you're right...


186 :

{T2C419}
[£o¢o]
Won't he finish counting to 100 soon?


187 :

{T2C420}
[Sora]
You're right.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
And Tsugumi's playing too, right?


188 :

{T2C421}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not playing.


189 :

{T2C422}
[Tsugumi]
I just happened to be around here.


{T2C423}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, stop talking about me that way. I hate
being doubted."

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright.


190 :

{T2C424}
[???]
"...e-i-g-h-t-y-s-e-v-e-n... 
e-i-g-h-t-y-e-i-g-h-t..."


191 :

{T2C425}
[Kid]
"What are you all doing here? You planning a 
strategy?"

[Takeshi]
No, not exactly...

[Takeshi]
Well, I guess we'd better scatter and hide.


192 :

{T2C426}
[Kid]
Yeah.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sora]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
Hey, what's the Kid doing here?


193 :

{T2C427}
[Kid]
Huh? What are you talking about?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Kid, you're...

[Takeshi]
Did you forget that you're 'it'?


194 :

{T2C428}
[Kid]
.........


195 :

{T2C429}
[???]
"...N-i-n-e-t-y-e-i-g-h-t... 
n-i-n-e-t-y-n-i-n-e..."


{T2C430}
[Kid]
Hey... Whose voice is that?


196 :
The lights turned on.

[Takeshi]
Wh-who turned the lights on?


197 :

{T2C431}
[Sora]
I did.

We were able to see the area around us.


198 :
Y¤u, Sora, £o¢o, Tsugumi, the Kid, me...

Everyone was accounted for.


199 :

{T2C432}
[Sora]
Everyone appears to be present.

Sora extended her hand out into the air.


{T2C433}
[Sora]
"The life readings of the complex do not 
appear to be abnormal."


{T2C434}
[Sora]
"There is nothing moving around the conference 
room."


200 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
I don't get it.


201 :

{T2C435}
[Kid]
Who could have been counting?

[Takeshi]
It wasn't you?


202 :

{T2C436}
[Kid]
N-no!

[Takeshi]
"I thought it sounded like you... So then 
who?"


203 :

{T2C437}
[Kid]
I d-dunno.


204 :
Kabing!


205 :

{T2C438}
[Y¤u]
H-hey...


{T2C439}
[£o¢o]
That was... the can being kicked.


{T2C440}
[Tsugumi]
Who?

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


206 :

{T2C441}
[Sora]
Could it be a ghost?

Sora said it with a straight face.


207 :

{T2C442}
[Sora]
"If it is a ghost, I would like to make its 
acquaintance..."


208 :
Splish, splash...

The sound of someone moving through the water
reached us from outside the room.

And then the empty can came rolling to a stop
in front of us.


209 :
Clatter, clatter, clatter...

The can stopped in a shallow area with a
hollow metallic sound.


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
Woooooooof!


210 :

{T2C443}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Pipi. Where have you been?

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sora]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


211 :
Pipi took the can in his mouth again and ran
circles around us.


212 :
That was the end of kick the can.

In the end, it remained a mystery who was
counting...

We passed the rest of the night uneventfully...

It was a peaceful time...

And I decided to enjoy a satisfying rest.
