1 :
Nearly an hour had passed since
the power had gone back online.

We gathered in the third floor conference room.

Takeshi, Tsugumi, Sora, Y¤u, Sara, and I‡Lall
six of us were sitting in chairs, just letting
time pass.

The rescue team still hadn't come.

Our situation didn't show any sign
of changing.


{S2C000}
[Takeshi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{S2C001}
[Y¤u]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{S2C002}
[Sara]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...


{S2C003}
[Tsugumi]
*Yaaaaaaaaawn*...

Takeshi's yawn was contagious.

I desperately tried to keep from yawning.

Only Sora had her head down and looked as if
she was thinking about something...

We were bored silly.

I hadn't realized that doing nothing could be
so hard.

(Well, I might as well get some exercise.)


Thinking that, I stood from the chair.


2 :

{S2C004}
[Sara]
What's up?

Sara shot me the question, slumped in the
chair next to mine.

[Kid]
"We've got all this time, so I thought 
I'd go for a little walk."


3 :

{S2C005}
[Sara]
"Oh. In that case, can you bring me back 
something to drink?"

[Kid]
Huh?

Why was that an 'in that case' thing?


4 :

{S2C006}
[Sara]
"I'm thirsty... I think there was juice in 
the kiosk, right?"

[Kid]
I think so.


5 :

{S2C007}
[Sara]
Okay. Thanks.

6 :
{11:0-53}
{11:1}No problem

{11:1}I don't think so


7 :
[Kid]
Oh well. So any kind of juice is okay?


{S2C008}
[Sara]
Sure. Anything is fine.

Great...

I felt like the group hierarchy had sorted
itself out.


8 :
[Kid]
I don't think so. Get it yourself.


9 :

{S2C009}
[Sara]
You won't do me a favor?

[Kid]
Nope.


10 :

{S2C010}
[Sara]
Why not? You're no use.

[Kid]
"That's exactly why you shouldn't be asking 
favors of me."


11 :

{S2C011}
[Sara]
"Listen. Kid, you've got some kind of memory 
problem, so you probably don't know, but at 
times like this guys are supposed to 
say, 'Sure.'"

[Kid]
"I... I don't think so. No matter how much 
memory I've lost, I know that much."


12 :

{S2C012}
[Sara]
Do you want me to ask Takeshi?

[Kid]
.........


13 :

{S2C013}
[Sara]
Or maybe Nakkyu.

[Kid]
.........


14 :

{S2C014}
[Sara]
Hey, Takeshi.

Sara started calling to Takeshi, sitting on
the other side of the table.

[Kid]
Alright. I got it...


15 :

{S2C015}
[Sara]
Really?

I gave up.

I was sure that Takeshi and Y¤u would side
with Sara.

I felt like I had fallen into a trap.

[Kid]
"You can't complain no matter what I bring 
back, okay?"


{S2C016}
[Sara]
Okay.

Ah, what a pain...


16 :
I left the conference room and headed for the
kiosk.

I had a good idea of where it was from my
wanderings around the complex the day before.


17 :
I went through the rest area on the way.

(Huh?)

Something had been left on the bench.

It was wrapped tuna sandwiches.

I figured they were probably sandwiches that
Takeshi had made and taken to Tsugumi and Sora.

I assumed that they had been forgotten during
the blackout.

(Alright. I might as well take these along.)

I took the sandwiches and put them into my
pockets.


18 :
At the kiosk, I started looking for drinks.

There was enough food and drinks for us to
survive for days.

There were only tuna sandwiches and ingredients
to make them there... but...

At least we didn't have to worry about
food, meaning it was a blessing in disguise.

I took six cans of cola from the kiosk's
freezer.

Only Sara had asked, but I thought I'd take
back enough for everyone.

[Kid]
Here we go.

Cradling cola in both arms, I started heading back.


19 :
[Kid]
Here you go!

When I came back, everyone was chatting loudly.


Cards were randomly placed on the table,
facing down.

They might have been playing a game.


20 :

{S2C017}
[Sara]
Welcome back.

[Kid]
"I figured since I was there I'd bring 
back enough for everyone."


{S2C018}
[Sara]
Thank you, sir!

Sara took two of the cans and handed
one to Y¤u.


21 :

{S2C019}
[Sara]
Here you go, Nakkyu.


22 :

{S2C020}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kid. That sure was thoughtful 
of you!"


23 :
Y¤u took the cola from Sara and popped
open the tab.


24 :
She held down the carbonation to keep it from
erupting.

Like a pro, she kept from being showered with
sticky liquid.

[Kid]
So what were you all up to with the cards?

I put the remaining four cans on the table.


25 :

{S2C021}
[Sara]
Mental Guts.

[Kid]
What's... that?


26 :

{S2C022}
[Sara]
You don't know Mental Guts?

[Kid]
Never heard of it.


27 :

{S2C023}
[Sara]
"Oh, I'll bet it went with your memory. 
It's a super famous game."

[Kid]
Hmmmph...


28 :
I realized that I couldn't remember even
those kinds of things...

I wondered if I should have been more
uneasy about my lost memory than I was.

First, I thought I'd have a cola.


[Kid]
Oh, by the way, I also brought these.

I remembered the sandwiches and plunged my
left hand into my pocket while holding the can
in my right.


29 :

{S2C024}
[Takeshi]
Eh? What?

[Kid]
These.

I removed a wrapped sandwich.


30 :

{S2C025}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Where'd you get these? Did you make 'em?

[Kid]
"It was on a bench in the rest area. 
Didn't you leave it there, Takeshi?"


31 :

{S2C026}
[Takeshi]
"Oh yeah. It's the one that I forgot to 
give to Sora. I left it there during the 
blackout hubbub."

[Kid]
I thought that somebody might be hungry.


32 :

{T2C059}
[Y¤u]
Oh, great!


33 :

{T2C060}
[Y¤u]
You're so thoughtful!

Y¤u rushed over and violently mussed up my
hair.

(Oh, that's right. I have another one.)

Feeling good about myself, I put the can in
my other hand and went to get the sandwich
from my right pocket.

[Kid]
What in...?


34 :

{S2C027}
[Y¤u]
What's the matter?

[Kid]
...It's gone.

There was nothing in my right pocket.


35 :

{S2C028}
[Y¤u]
Did you drop it?

[Kid]
No... No way...


36 :
I didn't think that I could have dropped it...

Somehow, I felt there was something odd
going on.


37 :

{S2C029}
[Takeshi]
Alright, then this is Sora's.


38 :
Looking, I saw Takeshi holding the sandwich
out toward Sora.


39 :

{S2C030}
[Takeshi]
You didn't eat breakfast, right?


{T2C064}
[Sora]
Uh, no... I'm fine...


40 :

{S2C031}
[Takeshi]
"Don't be polite, I made it. I know it tastes 
good."


41 :

{T2C065}
[Sora]
Still...


42 :

{S2C032}
[Takeshi]
Hey, I'm not kidding.


{S2C033}
[Sara]
I'll vouch for him, they're pretty good.


43 :
[Kid]
Uh, me too...

Sara and I both raised our hands in a show of
agreement.


44 :

{S2C034}
[Takeshi]
Sora? What? You can't eat my food?


45 :

{T2C068}
[Sora]
That's not it...


46 :

{S2C035}
[Takeshi]
"Then what is it? Eat too much yesterday? 
Or are you on a diet?"


{T2C069}
[Sora]
No, but... I...


{S2C036}
[Takeshi]
"No. You have to eat or you'll get weak. Here! 
Take it!"


47 :
He tossed a cola and tuna sandwich
toward Sora.

They traced a gentle arc through the air.


48 :

{T2C070}
[Sora]
Ahh...!


49 :
Sora suddenly reached out her hands...

She reached out, but...


50 :
[Takeshi]
.........


51 :
[Sora]
.........

But Sora didn't catch them.

No. She couldn't catch them.

She didn't avoid them.

It wasn't that she was too slow.

Sora was there with her hands extended into
space.

The sandwich had fallen at her feet.

The cola had violently slammed into the wall
behind her and exploded.

The spewing cola didn't get Sora wet.

The droplets looked like they flew through
Sora's body.

The sandwich wrapper covered the silhouette of
Sora's sandal...

It was as if the two had melded together.


52 :

{S2C037}
[Takeshi]
Huh...?

[Kid]
......

Takeshi wasn't the only one surprised.

I also... was confused and without a clue.


It could have been that it seemed odd because
I didn't know from the start.

Or maybe it seemed strange because
I'd forgotten it.

So all I could do was sit there with my mouth
agape, my eyes staring at the spectacle.


{T2C071}
[Sora]
That's why I said... I didn't need it.

Sora made an embarrassed-looking expression.


53 :

{S2C038}
[Takeshi]
Wwwwhhhhhhhhaaaaaattttttt!?


54 :

{S2C039}
[Takeshi]
No, that's, what, I...

Takeshi looked completely puzzled.


{S2C040}
[Takeshi]
"I meant to toss them as if I was handing 
them over... That's weird... Your hand must've 
slipped..."


55 :

{T2C072}
[Sora]
"Excuse me. Kuranari-san, there is nothing strange 
about it."


56 :

{S2C041}
[Takeshi]
"B-but! The cola blew up, and... is your 
clothing alright?"


{T2C073}
[Sora]
Yes.


57 :

{S2C042}
[Takeshi]
"But you're... stepping on the sandwich... Your 
foot... You've got no toes, Sora-san..."


58 :

{T2C074}
[Sora]
Oh...? My gosh! Sorry about that.


59 :
And just like that, Sora's vanished toes
reappeared.

But the place where the sandwich was supposed
to be wavered unsteadily.

I... didn't have any idea what it all meant.


60 :

{T2C075}
[Sora]
Uh, I guess... that you didn't know, Kuranari-san?

Sora was shuffling embarrassedly.


61 :

{S2C043}
[Takeshi]
Sora... What... in the world are you?


62 :

{T2C076}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*...

For some reason, Y¤u gave a huge sigh right
next to Takeshi.

And then...


63 :

{T2C077}
[Y¤u]
AHAHAHAHA~


64 :
She burst out laughing.


65 :

{T2C078}
[Y¤u]
"I just had to watch because it was so funny, 
Kuranari..."


66 :

{T2C079}
[Y¤u]
You really don't listen to anything...


67 :

{S2C044}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you talking about?

Takeshi was still confused.


{T2C080}
[Y¤u]
The explanation at the park entrance.


68 :

{S2C045}
[Takeshi]
So what!? What about it!?

Looking around, only Takeshi and I were
surprised.


69 :
A strange expression floated onto Sara's
face, but it seemed like she knew what was
going on.


70 :
Tsugumi's face was blank.

Apart from Takeshi, it seemed like nobody
felt it was anything to be that surprised
about.


71 :

{S2C046}
[Tsugumi]
Geez...!

Tsugumi stood up as if irritated.


72 :

{S2C047}
[Tsugumi]
"I can't watch any more of this... It's 
ridiculous."

After spitting out those words, she left the
conference room.


73 :
Maybe we were used to it, but we just watched
her go. No one tried to stop her.


74 :

{S2C048}
[Y¤u]
We'll just leave Tsugumi be...


75 :

{T2C087}
[Y¤u]
"Sora, sorry to bother you, but could you 
introduce yourself again?"


76 :

{T2C088}
[Sora]
Yes. Of course.

The punctured can had stopped fizzing.


77 :
Sora took a step toward us, carefully
avoiding the sandwich, and straightened
up.

After a slight bow, she spoke.


78 :

{T2C089}
[Sora]
I am Akanegasaki Sora...


79 :

{T2C090}
[Sora]
My official name is 'LM-RSDS-4913A'.


{T2C091}
[Sora]
"I am an artificial intelligence, or AI, 
program in charge of guiding visitors around 
LeMU."

[Takeshi]
.........


80 :

{T2C092}
[Sora]
"I have been programmed as one part 
of the LeMMIH system."


{T2C093}
[Sora]
"If you call me from any nearby terminal, 
I will soon appear anywhere within LeMU."


{T2C094}
[Sora]
"My image reaches you through a network 
supporting this RSD system throughout the 
complex. I think that there are few places in 
the world boasting this kind of technology."


{S2C049}
[Takeshi]
...?


81 :

{S2C050}
[Sara]
So it was RSD...


82 :

{S2C051}
[Sara]
But I've never seen one this amazing.


83 :

{T2C096}
[Y¤u]
It's one of LeMU's big attractions.


84 :

{S2C052}
[Sara]
"So that's why Sora disappeared during the 
blackout?"


85 :

{T2C098}
[Sora]
"Yes. I'm sorry to have caused you undue 
concern..."

I had finally lost any sense of what was going
on.

Takeshi looked flustered as well.

The conversation had taken off and left me and
Takeshi behind.

[Kid]
What's RSD?


86 :

{T2C100}
[Y¤u]
"Simply put, it is an image display system 
that uses a semiconductor to shine a laser 
directly on your retina."

[Kid]
I... I see...

I nodded.


87 :
I had no clue what she was talking about...


But I thought it might have been because
I had no memory.

It also seemed that any more questions
would stall the conversation.

So I decided to take an 'I don't get it,
but that's okay' approach.


88 :

{S2C053}
[Sara]
"And it's supporting such an advanced 
personality."

The surprising thing was that Sara seemed to be
following the conversation the best.


{T2C103}
[Sora]
"LeMU is fairly perfectionist when it comes to 
virtual space technologies. My existence is 
one manifestation of that."


89 :

{S2C054}
[Sara]
Doesn't that require a big system?


90 :

{S2C055}
[Sora]
"Yes, but it is much smaller than it would 
have been several decades ago."


91 :

{S2C056}
[Sara]
How big? Where is it? I'd like to see it.


92 :

{T2C107}
[Sora]
"Uh... I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to say. 
It is a secret."


{S2C057}
[Sara]
You weren't given the details?


{T2C109}
[Sora]
That's correct.


93 :

{S2C058}
[Sara]
Hmmmm...


94 :

{S2C059}
[Sara]
"Well, this is a bit of a different question, 
but does Sora's personality change based on 
her memories...?"

95 :
The conversation was getting more and more
technical.

Sara kept badgering Sora with technical
questions.

Things about samplings and algorithms and
structure this and encode that... Jargon was
flying around.

My head started to hurt.


96 :
[Kid]
Hey... Y¤u?

I approached Y¤u and tugged on her sleeve.


97 :

{S2C060}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm?

[Kid]
"This conversation is crazy complex... What's 
with Sara, anyway?"


98 :

{S2C061}
[Y¤u]
She is... a computer ninja of sorts.

[Kid]
Stop with the stupid jokes.


99 :
Y¤u puffed out her cheeks as if pouting. It
didn't seem she was in the mood for a
comeback.


100 :

{S2C062}
[Y¤u]
Mayo? She's a hacker.

Hacker? That means...

101 :
{11:0-55}
{11:1}What's a hacker?

{11:1}Naturally, I know what hacker means


102 :
[Kid]
Hacker?


103 :

{S2C063}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. How should I explain this... I guess you 
could say a computer expert of sorts."


104 :

{S2C064}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, she knows everything about computers. 
And she kicks butt when it comes to 
programming too."


105 :

{S2C065}
[Y¤u]
"She writes programs for fun. Just the other 
day, she got first place in some cracking 
contest..."

[Kid]
Cracking contest?


106 :

{S2C066}
[Y¤u]
"A contest to break codes. Just so you know, 
it's not illegal."


{S2C067}
[Y¤u]
"It was sponsored by some company with code 
technology. It was legal cracking to test their 
security..."


{S2C068}
[Y¤u]
"The company has hackers attack their 
algorithms."

[Kid]
Uh, uh...

I was getting more and more lost.


107 :

{S2C069}
[Y¤u]
"Just think of it as a decryption game 
contest."


108 :
[Kid]
Is Sara a programmer?


109 :

{S2C070}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. But she says it's just a hobby.


{S2C071}
[Y¤u]
But she's as good as a pro.


110 :

{S2C072}
[Y¤u]
"Just the other day, she got first place in 
some cracking contest..."

[Kid]
Cracking contest?


111 :

{S2C073}
[Y¤u]
"A contest to break codes. Just so you know, 
it's not illegal."


{S2C074}
[Y¤u]
"It was sponsored by some company with code 
technology. It was legal cracking to test their 
security..."


{S2C075}
[Y¤u]
"The company has hackers attack their 
algorithms."

[Kid]
Kind of like a decryption game contest?


112 :

{S2C076}
[Y¤u]
I guess that's one way of putting it.


113 :
[Kid]
Oh, so it's a game.


114 :

{S2C077}
[Y¤u]
"Just because you call it a game, I wouldn't 
take it lightly."


115 :

{S2C078}
[Y¤u]
"There were engineers participating from all 
over the world."


{S2C079}
[Y¤u]
"Winning it means that you're one of the 
world's best hackers."


116 :

{S2C080}
[Y¤u]
You could even say THE best hacker.

[Kid]
THE best...?

[Kid]
That's just way too incredible.


117 :

{S2C081}
[Y¤u]
I know.


{S2C082}
[Y¤u]
When it comes to computers... she's a genius.

[Kid]
I see...


118 :
It seemed that you truly couldn't tell who a
person was by appearances.

Apart from being a little mischievous, she
just seemed like a normal girl.


119 :
But Sara just kept talking with Sora about
things that I couldn't comprehend.

There was a gap between who she appeared to
be and who she actually was.

I kept staring at Sara from the side in a
state of semi-awe.

.................

In the end, only Takeshi was completely
surprised that Sora was AI.

Y¤u was an employee at LeMU,
so of course she knew.

Before leaving the room, Tsugumi hadn't seemed
that surprised.

Sara, as was clear by her questions, had a
solid grip on the situation.

And the whole situation we were in was so
crazy... I didn't know WHAT to be surprised
about.


120 :
Several hours passed.

It seemed the sun was getting ready to set.

In the dark depths of the ocean, my sense of
time had eroded.

I checked the time on my watch, finally making
sure it was night.

Nothing changed in LeMU.

No one new showed up to visit us.

But things hadn't taken a turn for the worse,
either. There didn't seem to be any impending
danger of floor collapse.

We each spent the time as we pleased.


We had long forgotten that we were trapped.



121 :
I was in the rest area.

I sat on the bench and looked at the
blooming flowers without really seeing them.

There was no one else... around.

We were going to meet again at 7 p.m. Until
then, we had free time.

I was thinking about Sora.

The revealing of what she really was.

Sora's real identity.

AI... Artificial intelligence... A program... A
virtual image.

Sora didn't really exist.

In other words, Sora wasn't a person.

But Sora clearly had a will of her own.

She could think and act for herself.

...I knew that much.

But with my limited knowledge, everything
other than that was beyond me.

There were lots of things that I couldn't know.


I looked down.

The floor was covered with a layer of water.

The lights in the ceiling were reflected in
the water.

It was like the cold light of the moon.


I poked my finger into the water.

‡LPlop.

The water rippled, and the surface shook.

The light in the water fragmented into
disarray... finally returning to its original
shapes.

I reached into the water, trying to grab
the light.

But...

I could only grab a little seawater... I
couldn't touch the light.

I tried again and again, but no matter how
I tried, I couldn't grab the moon.


122 :
.................


123 :

{S2C083}
[Sora]
So where should I start explaining?

[Kid]
I wish you'd start with the basic stuff.

Sora was sitting next to me.

At least that was how it appeared to me.

I had decided to seek out an explanation
directly from Sora.

What exactly was Sora?

It might have been rude asking her outright
like that, but...

But I thought that it would be ruder to
continue along without really knowing.


124 :

{S2C084}
[Sora]
I see. So we were talking about RSD, right?

[Kid]
Yeah.

[Kid]
"It might be something that you 
really don't want to talk about..."


125 :

{S2C085}
[Sora]
Why would that be?

[Kid]
"Well, you're not a person, you're Sora... So 
asking about systems and stuff, it might be 
kind of personal..."


126 :
[Kid]
Uh... I don't really know how to say it...

[Kid]
"I just thought that it might be like... 
someone was peeking inside you, and kind of 
unpleasant..."

My broken explanation brought a soft smile to
Sora's face.


{S2C086}
[Sora]
You don't have to worry about that.


127 :

{S2C087}
[Sora]
"What did you just say... I'm Sora. So I am 
what I am."


{S2C088}
[Sora]
"For example, by explaining about what 
I am... it is a way for you to better 
understand me."

[Kid]
.........

I squeezed my hand shut.

Of course, I wasn't holding anything.


{S2C089}
[Sora]
"Actually, I just explained all of this to 
Kuranari-san."

[Kid]
Huh? To Takeshi?


128 :

{S2C090}
[Sora]
Yes.

Sora gently put her hand on her chest.


129 :

{S2C091}
[Sora]
"I am different from everyone else, 
but I want to be the same."


{S2C092}
[Sora]
"That... That is why I want everyone to know 
about me."


130 :
Saying that, Sora looked at me and slightly
dropped her eyes.

I felt like pieces of the puzzle scattered on
the floor of my mind were about to fall into
place.

As if enticed by her grin, I became quiet.


131 :

{S2C093}
[Sora]
"Well, shall I start... with an explanation 
of RSD?"

I concentrated on what she was saying so as
not to miss anything.

She placed both of her hands on her chest.


132 :

{S2C094}
[Sora]
Kid-san, can you see me?

[Kid]
Yes. I see you.


{S2C095}
[Sora]
I am standing right next to you. You're sure?

[Kid]
I'm positive.


{S2C096}
[Sora]
But...


133 :
Suddenly, Sora faced me and reached out toward
me.

And then...

[Kid]
Whoooaa!

Sora's hands slipped into my chest without
resistance.

Reflexively, I tried to grab her arms, but my
hands met with nothing.

My hands were in front of my chest, but there
was nothing there.


134 :

{S2C097}
[Sora]
Yes...


{S2C098}
[Sora]
So you are seeing me.


{S2C099}
[Sora]
However, I am not right next to you.

Saying that, Sora pulled her hand back.


135 :

{T2C156}
[Sora]
RSD stands for Retinal Scanning Display.


{T2C157}
[Sora]
The display device is not actually a display.


{T2C158}
[Sora]
Rather, a weak laser is aimed at the retina.

[Kid]
Retina? You mean my eye?


136 :

{T2C159}
[Sora]
Yes.


137 :

{T2C160}
[Sora]
"In the ceiling of each room and corridor are 
semiconductor laser output devices."


{S2C100}
[Sora]
"So the image is being directly reflected on 
your retina."

[Kid]
Image?


138 :

{T2C162}
[Sora]
Yes. My image.

[Kid]
Directly on my retina...


139 :

{T2C163}
[Sora]
"Holographic screens typically allow for the 
objects behind them to be visible..."


{T2C164}
[Sora]
"This system uses the eyeball as a virtual 
screen and continuously sends an image 
synthesized with the background scenery."

[Kid]
Well, what about your voice?

[Kid]
"It sounds like your voice is coming from 
where your mouth appears."


140 :

{S2C101}
[Sora]
Have you ever heard 3D sound?

[Kid]
3D sound?


141 :

{T2C169}
[Sora]
"Have you ever listened to music using 
headphones?"

[Kid]
"Hmmm, probably. But I can't remember, so 
I don't know for sure."


142 :

{S2C102}
[Sora]
Ah, that's right. Sorry about that.


143 :

{S2C103}
[Sora]
"To answer my own question, most people hear 
the sound as if it is reverberating inside the center 
of their head, toward the back."

[Kid]
Inside their head?

I tried to visualize what she meant.

A melody playing in my mind...

I could get a vague sense of what she said...

[Kid]
Yeah... I think I kind of see what you mean.

[Kid]
"I think I've probably heard something like 
that before."


144 :

{T2C172}
[Sora]
"But the sound is not actually 
coming from inside your head."

[Kid]
I suppose not.


145 :

{T2C173}
[Sora]
"But if you could apply this knowledge and 
adjust the volume from the left and the right 
to accurately simulate this reverberating 
sound..."


{T2C174}
[Sora]
"Then you could create the illusion that a 
sound was coming from above or below, left 
or right, any direction."

[Kid]
"I see. Oh... So you mean the voice 
converters!"

I still had both of them in my ears. I
removed them. They were about the size of
the tip of my little finger.


146 :
In front of me, Sora's mouth moved soundlessly.

It was like I couldn't hear her voice.

But that wasn't all. Then her image started
to get a little fuzzy.

[Kid]
Huh?


147 :
When I replaced the voice converters, Sora
returned to normal.


148 :

{T2C175}
[Sora]
"The image's position is based on the 
location of the voice converters."


{S2C104}
[Sora]
"So wherever you stand and whichever 
direction you face..."


{S2C105}
[Sora]
"LeMMIH is constantly using sensors around 
the complex that monitor the position of 
the voice converters to the millimeter."


149 :

{S2C106}
[Sora]
So that when I am 20 meters behind you...


{S2C107}
[Sora]
"My voice will sound as if I am exactly 20 
meters behind you."


{S2C108}
[Sora]
"When I am to the right, sound comes from the 
right. When I am to the left, sound comes from the 
left."


{S2C109}
[Sora]
When I am under you, sound comes from...

[Kid]
Under...? When you're under...?


150 :
[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
.........


151 :

{T2C182}
[Sora]
Um, well...


152 :

{T2C183}
[Sora]
"Anyway, that is how it works. Do you 
understand?"

[Kid]
.........


153 :

{S2C110}
[Sora]
Kid-san, now try to face a little to the left.

I faced to the left as she said.

Sora stood and moved around to my right.


154 :

{S2C111}
[Sora]
"Just a moment ago, I said that LeMMIH is 
constantly monitoring your position and 
direction you are facing..."


{S2C112}
[Sora]
"At the same time, LeMMIH is also 
monitoring the position of your eyeballs."


{S2C113}
[Sora]
"So that even if you move, I still appear 
in the same place."


{T2C188}
[Sora]
"This means that LeMMIH scans the image onto 
your eye in this way."

[Kid]
"So you can be made to suddenly disappear or 
reappear in another place?"


155 :

{T2C189}
[Sora]
Do you want to see it?

[Kid]
...No... I think I'll pass.

I suddenly imagined Sora disappearing and
fleeting around here and there.

[Kid]
It's kind of like... you're a ghost.


156 :

{T2C207}
[Sora]
Yes. I hear that a lot.


157 :

{T2C208}
[Sora]
"Being in the same place and looking at the 
same thing, only some people can see it and 
some people can't."


{T2C209}
[Sora]
"I've never seen one, but if ghosts really do 
exist..."


{T2C210}
[Sora]
I imagine they exist much the way that I do.

[Kid]
Hmmm... Now I get it...

[Kid]
But there is something that bothers me.


158 :

{T2C211}
[Sora]
What is that?

[Kid]
"Sora, so you can't be in more than one place 
at a time?"

[Kid]
"For example, you couldn't be in one room 
talking to me and another talking with Sara?"


159 :

{T2C212}
[Sora]
Theoretically, it is possible.


{T2C213}
[Sora]
"However, the way that I am designed, I can't 
do that."

[Kid]
Why not?


{T2C214}
[Sora]
"I imagine it is to help maintain an image of 
reality for visitors."


{T2C215}
[Sora]
"So that there is only one 'Sora' in the 
world."


{T2C216}
[Sora]
"Without that kind of setting, visitors would 
get confused."

[Kid]
?


160 :

{T2C217}
[Sora]
That, and it was the policy of my designer.


{T2C218}
[Sora]
"The policy of my designer was to create me as 
a character with an independent personality..."


161 :

{T2C219}
[Sora]
"That reminds me, I have heard the same 
thing about the 'United Land' characters."


{T2C220}
[Sora]
"There is only one of each character in the 
park."


{T2C221}
[Sora]
"Like in a story... there can't be any one 
character in two places at the same time..."


162 :
The time for our gathering was getting near,
so Sora and I headed to the conference room.

It seemed strange that Sora, who could
teleport anywhere instantly, was walking...

Maybe she was doing it to humor me.


163 :
[Kid]
"I was wondering about the laser retina 
scan..."

[Kid]
"So if I was in a place that the laser 
couldn't reach, then I couldn't see you?"


{T2C222}
[Sora]
Of course not. But...


{T2C223}
[Sora]
"The scanning devices are located in every 
room of the complex, and there are mirrors 
embedded in the walls, ceilings, and floors 
to reflect the images."


164 :

{T2C224}
[Sora]
"So, almost no matter where you are, I can be 
displayed."

[Kid]
So there are no blind spots...


{T2C225}
[Sora]
That's the way it is designed.


165 :

{T2C226}
[Sora]
However, there is one major flaw.

[Kid]
Flaw?


166 :

{T2C227}
[Sora]
I...


167 :

{T2C228}
[Sora]
I am only 'seen' when someone looks at me.

[Kid]
What?


168 :

{T2C229}
[Sora]
"I mean that I cease to exist 
when no one is looking at me."


169 :

{T2C230}
[Sora]
"For example, if the five of you here all 
closed your eyes at once..."


{T2C231}
[Sora]
At that moment, I would cease to exist.

[Kid]
.........


170 :
I casually held my hand up in front of my eyes.

I covered my view forward and looked down
near my feet.

There was no sign of Sora next to me.
It was as if she had vanished or never
been there in the first place.


171 :
Surprised, I removed my hand, and Sora
reappeared in the corridor.

The outline of Sora's sandals blurred dimly
in the water.


172 :

{T2C232}
[Sora]
Someone has to 'see' me.


{T2C233}
[Sora]
I have to be seen in order to exist.


173 :

{T2C234}
[Sora]
Vision...


{T2C235}
[Sora]
Someone's perspective actually creates me.


174 :

{S2C114}
[Sora]
Kid-san...


{S2C115}
[Sora]
When you close your eyes, I disappear.


175 :
Eventually, we reached the conference room.

Sora's face was one big smile.

But somewhere in her smile seemed a hint of
sadness.

At least... it appeared that way to me.
