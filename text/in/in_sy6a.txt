1 :
The next thing I knew... I was standing there.

[Kid]
.........

The corridor I was in wasn't very popular.

It was completely silent.

It was narrow... dark... cold...


(Where... is this...?)

I wondered if I was really in LeMU.

Nothing looked familiar.

It was like an unknown world.

I just stood there in the middle of the
foreign corridor.


2 :
Wait...

I... I knew that space.

For some reason, it seemed familiar to me.

Like an image that appeared and hid
in the mist, not quite visible.

Or like the moon peeking in between gaps in a
thick night fog.

...It was a corridor that stretched
on straight forward.

It seemed to go on forever in both directions.


I started walking without really
thinking about it.

(...I've been here before...)

(But when could that have been?)

It felt like something long ago, but at the
same time like something recent.

I couldn't remember when.

I just kept walking to nowhere in particular.

(...I have to go...)

But where was it that I felt I had to go?

I didn't know why, but I felt that I had to go.

(...That's why I'm walking...)

In a soundless world.

A colorless world.

A scentless world.

A world that didn't exist anywhere...


3 :
And then the scenery suddenly changed.

I found myself in a big room.

It was big... and white... and quiet...

(...This looks like a hospital...)

That was what I thought.

In a corner of the room were three
capsule-like machines.

As if they were calling out to me,
I approached the capsules.

Someone was in the capsules...

Someone was sleeping in there.

I reached out my right hand toward the capsule.

My hand... made contact.


4 :
And that instant, without a sound,
the lights went off.

(Huh?)

Startled, I tried to jump backward.

But my right hand was stuck to the capsule
and I couldn't pull it back.

I looked back at the capsule.

(‡L‡L!?)


5 :
From the point where my hand was touching the
capsule's lid, a blackish, sticky liquid began
seeping out.

No, it was more dark blue than black.

The capsule continued to ooze... blackish
blue and deep blue.

I didn't know and couldn't imagine what was
going on.

(That's right! Someone's inside.
I have to open this and save them...!)

But my body wouldn't move. It felt paralyzed.

I stopped breathing and could only watch what
was unfolding.

Finally, that sticky blue liquid covered the
entire capsule.

But it didn't stop there. It kept going...

To the floor, the walls, the ceiling... as if
it would swallow the whole room.

It was like a living animal with a will of its
own reproducing itself.

The sticky blue liquid began to crawl up
my body.

Up my legs and my hands... inside my clothes
and between my legs.

I couldn't shake it off or scream. I could
only watch.

After covering my body, it forced my mouth
open and started flowing inside.

It invaded me through my ears, nose, and the
pores of my skin.

In my body, the 'blue' traveled around, reaching
my brain, my lungs, and my heart.

It began eating away at my brain, my organs,
and my blood vessels.

The blue liquid sucked my blood and started
changing its color to black.

I was changing into something that wasn't me...

(Aaaaaaahhhhhh...!)


6 :
(‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L!)


Assaulted by boundless fear and horrible
despair... I howled a soundless scream.


7 :
My eyes snapped open.

The next thing I knew, I was on a bed.

It smelled of disinfectant...

I wondered where I was.

I was drenched in sweat.

My heart was pounding.

I had a dull headache.

I lifted up my torso and glanced around me.

The room was dim... but nothing seemed out of
the ordinary.

It was scenery that I knew.

(Oh yeah... I'm back in the infirmary...)

I finally realized that I had just been having
a dream.

I got my breath back and thought back to the
dream.

(Uh... Let's see...)

(.........)

(............?)

What had seemed so vivid only moments ago
seemed to vanish from my mind like clouds
covering the night sky.

All that was left was an unknown fear,
a slight headache... and a fragment of a dream.

I gave up and looked around me.

The area was enveloped in a faint darkness.

It wasn't a blackout.

The lights had been dimmed to make it easier
to sleep.

The proof seemed to be the light breathing
that I could hear coming from the bed next
me. I thought it might be Sara.

Wide awake, I got out of bed.


I suddenly noticed something.

There was someone lying face down next to my
bed asleep.

I squinted to see who it might be...

...It was Y¤u.

I thought that she was going to be sore for
sure after sleeping in that position.

To at least keep her from catching a cold,
I went to cover her with a blanket.

Just then...


8 :

{Y6A000}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...


9 :

{Y6A001}
[Y¤u]
Oh... Kid? Good morning.

[Kid]
Oh, did I wake you up?


{Y6A002}
[Y¤u]
"No... I didn't mean to go to sleep. I guess I 
dozed off."


10 :

{Y6A003}
[Y¤u]
Alright then!

Y¤u shouted as she stood up.


{Y6A004}
[Y¤u]
So? How're you feeling?

[Kid]
I feel perfectly fine.


11 :

{Y6A005}
[Y¤u]
"How could you be? You've been hearing things, 
seeing things... and that's proof that your 
nerves are shot."

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A006}
[Y¤u]
"I've been looking out for you every night, so 
I feel kind of responsible."

[Kid]
It's not your fault.


12 :

{Y6A007}
[Y¤u]
Well, that makes me feel a little better.

Saying that, Y¤u shrugged her shoulders.

[Kid]
"I'm done with the bed, so you can sleep here, 
Y¤u."


{Y6A008}
[Y¤u]
What about you?

[Kid]
I slept enough this afternoon. I'm not tired.


{Y6A009}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm. I see...

Y¤u thought for a minute...


13 :

{Y6A010}
[Y¤u]
"In that case, will you hang out with me 
tonight?"

[Kid]
Uh, sure.

So we decided to hang out again that night
in what seemed to be becoming a nightly ritual.


14 :
The Lemurian Ruins.

We climbed on top of the roof of one of the
buildings and gazed out over the scenery.

I actually didn't know why we had decided to
climb up on that particular night.

But if I was to take a stab at the reason...

It was probably because Lemuria was so
beautiful then.

For a while, the two of us were silent, just
enjoying the view.

Finally, I started the conversation.

[Kid]
Let's get to the bottom of things.


{Y6A011}
[Y¤u]
To the bottom of what?

[Kid]
Let's get to the truth about your past.

[Kid]
About your father and mother.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
That and the truth about my past.

[Kid]
"About my lost memories and my ability to see 
the future."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"That and one more thing: the truth about all 
of our pasts."

[Kid]
And why this accident happened.

[Kid]
"Why were we the only ones trapped here? Why 
couldn't we get out?"

[Y¤u]
..................

[Kid]
I'm tired of dwelling on this.

[Kid]
"I mean it. Let's really figure things out 
tonight."


15 :

{Y6A012}
[Y¤u]
Um... Kid...

Y¤u stared into the distance.

[Kid]
?


{Y6A013}
[Y¤u]
"I'm sorry, but could we just forget about 
that today?"

[Kid]
Huh? Why...?


{Y6A014}
[Y¤u]
I just feel so tired...


{Y6A015}
[Y¤u]
"That wasn't the reason that I invited you 
here today."

[Kid]
.........

I wondered why we had come there.


{Y6A016}
[Y¤u]
"Why do you get so caught up in knowing about 
the past of people?"


{Y6A017}
[Y¤u]
"You can never take back what's happened in 
the past..."


{Y6A018}
[Y¤u]
"All we can do is live in the moment with 
what's happening to us right this instant."


{Y6A019}
[Y¤u]
"We can't hop back and forth to the past or 
the future."

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A020}
[Y¤u]
The future will come.


{Y6A021}
[Y¤u]
"But until that moment comes, the future is 
just like the dark."


{Y6A022}
[Y¤u]
You can't see anything.


{Y6A023}
[Y¤u]
"You never know what might happen a minute 
from now."


{Y6A024}
[Y¤u]
"The future is scary, so that's why people 
look to the past."


{Y6A025}
[Y¤u]
"If you look back, everything is clearly 
illuminated."


{Y6A026}
[Y¤u]
But...


{Y6A027}
[Y¤u]
The past is really the same.


{Y6A028}
[Y¤u]
"The further that you get away from the 
present, the darker it is and the less you 
can see."

[Kid]
.........

To me, it seemed to lose your memory, like
I had, made everything pitch black...

No, rather, things became nothing.


{Y6A029}
[Y¤u]
"The only sphere that we can truly know is 
really tiny."


{Y6A030}
[Y¤u]
"Especially when it comes to time; we're 
essentially blind."


{Y6A031}
[Y¤u]
That's why I... I...


{Y6A032}
[Y¤u]
I just want to value this moment.


{Y6A033}
[Y¤u]
"The past and the future... I don't care about 
them anymore."

[Kid]
.........

I was left speechless.

There was nothing I could be expected to say.

Because she was no longer focused on
reflecting on her past.

She was different from me.

I alone was intent on knowing everything.

I believed that I had to know it, or else.

But Y¤u wasn't like that.

The dragon had left the damsel free.

There was no longer... any need to vanquish it.



16 :
............

............

............

I didn't know how much time had passed.


17 :
There nothing for us to do, so we just gave
ourselves to the slowly passing time.

Even though there was no meaning in it.

I didn't feel that there was any reason for
being there.

(I've had enough of this.)

I stood up quickly.

[Kid]
So should we get some sleep?


{Y6A034}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
What?

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
What's wrong?


{Y6A035}
[Y¤u]
I want...


{Y6A036}
[Y¤u]
"I want to spend... just a little more time 
with you."

[Kid]
Huh? But...

'But there's nothing for us to do, is there?'

That was what I was about to say,
but Y¤u said...


{Y6A037}
[Y¤u]
"There's something about being with you that 
relaxes me..."

[Kid]
.........

I sat down again where I was.

I figured that even if it was nothing to me,
it might mean something to her...


{Y6A038}
[Y¤u]
Hey. Do you know what I'm thinking right now?

I shook my head.


{Y6A039}
[Y¤u]
Guess.

[Kid]
How am I supposed to know...?


{Y6A040}
[Y¤u]
You traveled through time, right?


{Y6A041}
[Y¤u]
You experienced all this before, right?


{Y6A042}
[Y¤u]
"In that case, you should know what 
I'm about to do."

[Kid]
You don't believe in time travel, right?


{Y6A043}
[Y¤u]
That's not what I'm saying.

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A044}
[Y¤u]
So guess.

Y¤u repeated herself.

[Kid]
Are... you going to do something?


{Y6A045}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, probably.

[Kid]
What... are you going to do?


{Y6A046}
[Y¤u]
I keep telling you to guess, right?

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A047}
[Y¤u]
You don't know?

[Kid]
I don't know.


{Y6A048}
[Y¤u]
"What is it you're supposed to do at times 
like this?"

[Kid]
What?


{Y6A049}
[Y¤u]
Use your other eye.

My other eye...

[Kid]
The third eye?


{Y6A050}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{Y6A051}
[Y¤u]
"When the third eye opens, true wisdom is 
apparent, and all becomes visible."

[Kid]
But how?


{Y6A052}
[Y¤u]
You want me to teach you?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...

It was something I had hoped for.

If I could harness that power, then my past
memory...


{Y6A053}
[Y¤u]
First, do you know where the first eye is?

I cocked my head, thinking.


{Y6A054}
[Y¤u]
It's here.


18 :
As she spoke, Y¤u's index finger approached my
right eye.

I closed it...

The tip of Y¤u's finger touched my eyelid.


{Y6A055}
[Y¤u]
And the second eye?


{Y6A056}
[Y¤u]
Right here...

Without giving me a second to think, Y¤u did
the same thing to my left eye.


19 :

{Y6A057}
[Y¤u]
And the third eye...


{Y6A058}
[Y¤u]
That's... right... here...

..........

.......

....

I felt something soft touch my lips.


20 :
Startled, I opened my eyes.

My mind went completely blank.

I couldn't think of anything.

The third eye...?

Had I found true wisdom? Had all things become
visible to me?

It was a lie!

I felt more and more confused.


I only...

The scene in front of me... The soft
touch of skin...

And the sweet smell that made my brain
numb... It was all I could do to absorb those.


21 :
That so-called third eye gave only the truth,
warmth, confusion, and affection...

That night passed as I etched... pure...
slow... and new memories into my mind.


22 :
The next morning.

After breakfast, we all gathered in the
conference room.

More accurately, we gathered because Sora had
called us together.

Tsugumi also made a rare appearance.


23 :

{T6A000}
[Sora]
"There is an important reason why I've called 
all of you here."


{T6A001}
[Sora]
"There is something that I wanted to inform 
you about as soon as possible."


{T6A002}
[Sora]
"I know it is difficult, but it is important 
for you to accurately realize the full gravity 
of this situation."


{T6A003}
[Sora]
"Please don't panic, settle down... and listen 
carefully."

Sora paused for a second.

Sora looked at all five of us in turn... Y¤u,
Tsugumi, Sara, Takeshi, and me.


The conference room was silent.

But I could hear the sound of water coming
faintly from somewhere.

Was it water lapping in the hallways...?

Moments later, I couldn't hear it anymore.

As if Sora was waiting for that cue,
she slowly opened her mouth.


{T6A004}
[Sora]
The situation... is not good.

Sora extended her hand, and a holographic
window appeared in the space in front of us.

I felt like I hadn't seen her do that for a
while.


24 :

{T6A005}
[Sora]
"Currently, there are no areas that 
show signs of new flooding."


{T6A006}
[Sora]
"Since the flooding of the Cosmic Whale area 
in Dritter Stock last night, there have been 
no further reports of significant damage."


{T6A007}
[Sora]
"The burden being placed on LeMU's support 
columns has increased due to the flooding."


{T6A008}
[Sora]
"The structural distortion between floors is 
increasing."


{T6A009}
[Sora]
"If this continues, LeMU will eventually lose 
its equilibrium and tilt dramatically."


{T6A010}
[Sora]
"If the damage to the areas connecting the 
floors of different sectors increases, there 
is the possibility that pipe leaks could 
flood the dry sectors."


{T6A011}
[Sora]
"In other words... we can't afford to be 
careless. Things are critical."


{T6A012}
[Sora]
I think that I told you this before...


{T6A013}
[Sora]
"Implosion of LeMU is estimated to occur at 
4:30 a.m. on May 7th."


{T6A014}
[Sora]
"The calculation has a margin of error of plus 
or minus twelve hours."


{T6A015}
[Sora]
"There has been no significant change in this 
prediction."


{T6A016}
[Sora]
"In one area, the strength limits of 
partitions have already been exceeded."


{T6A017}
[Sora]
"The destruction of LeMU will be gradual, but 
it will inevitably and steadily occur."


{T6A018}
[Sora]
It is... only a matter of time.


25 :
Sora told all of us that with a calm look on
her face.

We all swallowed and held our breath as we
listened.

We knew we were reaching our time limit.

We had no choice but to accept that reality.

There was no avoiding the situation.


26 :

{T6A019}
[Sora]
"Presently, the power generator is functioning 
normally."


{T6A020}
[Sora]
"However, if by chance there is a 
blackout... we will switch to the emergency 
power source battery."


{T6A021}
[Sora]
"This is generally meant for supporting the 
emergency lighting and the maintenance on 
LeMU's system... It should last for about two 
hours."

Sora's matter-of-fact way of speaking only
raised the tension in our minds.

For Takeshi, Sara, and Tsugumi.

And for Y¤u.

I couldn't get the image of Y¤u, burned into
my brain the night before, out of my mind.

I still felt as if our lips were touching.


From the morning, Y¤u and I had avoided one
another's eyes.

I wasn't sure if we had even exchanged words.

Y¤u looked straight ahead.

I was more conscious of Y¤u than of anything
else.

I didn't know how I should act around her from
then on.

But...

I had other things to worry about.

I turned back to the situation at hand,
listening carefully to Sora's report.

{T6A022}
[Sora]
"The normal communication channels are still 
not functioning."


{T6A023}
[Sora]
Nor have I found an escape route.


{T6A024}
[Sora]
However...


{T6A025}
[Sora]
"I have made protecting you my top priority, 
and LeMMIH is devoting all of its resources 
to that objective."


{T6A026}
[Sora]
"I am also using all sensors, lights, 
manipulators, and means at my disposal outside 
of the complex..."


{T6A027}
[Sora]
"And I am still investigating whether there 
are any means of communicating with the 
outside using light, radio, or sound."

Sora nodded her head, straightened her back,
and surveyed the room. We were all silent.

There was a look of determination in her eyes.


{T6A028}
[Sora]
Let me say one thing more...


{T6A029}
[Sora]
That... as long as I, Akanegasaki Sora, exist...


{T6A030}
[Sora]
"And while my powers are limited, as long as 
you are here..."


{T6A031}
[Sora]
"I will do my utmost to find a way for you to 
escape to safety."


{T6A032}
[Sora]
"We do not have much longer together, but I, 
Akanegasaki Sora, am at your service."

She concluded with a serious nod.

We also nodded in agreement.


27 :

{T6A033}
[Sora]
"We must wait... and believe that help is 
on its way."

Sora's serious expression gave way to a smile.


{T6A034}
[Sora]
Everyone, let's pray for a safe rescue.

The gloomy atmosphere that had been hanging
over the gathering lightened, and everyone
started thinking about how they should spend
their time.

Sora's smile instilled everyone with courage.

I was grateful for that piece of code in
Sora's program, the function that allowed her
to be calm in times of trouble...


28 :

{Y6A059}
[Sora]
Now, let's end this meeting.


{Y6A060}
[Sora]
"Until there is new information available, 
please do what you will."


{Y6A061}
[Sora]
"However, if you do discover anything, please 
inform me immediately via LeMMIH..."


29 :

{Y6A062}
[Tsugumi]
Excuse me, Sora?


{T6A146}
[Sora]
Ah yes, Komachi-san... What is on your mind?

Tsugumi suddenly stood in front of Sora.

Her smile seemed just a little forced.


{Y6A063}
[Tsugumi]
"There's something I want to talk with you 
about. Alone..."


{T6A148}
[Sora]
In private?


{Y6A064}
[Tsugumi]
Yes... please.


{Y6A065}
[Tsugumi]
"Actually, I have a proposal, an idea of how to 
escape from here."


{T6A151}
[Sora]
"Yes, really? Have you come up with a good 
method?"


{Y6A066}
[Tsugumi]
"Yeah. One that you don't know. Only I know 
about it."


{Y6A067}
[Tsugumi]
"I heard from Sara that your operating 
priorities have been changed."


{Y6A068}
[Tsugumi]
"That you're not as stubborn about protecting 
Leiblich as before."


{Y6A069}
[Sora]
Y-yes... and what about it?


{Y6A070}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe you can work with me now.


30 :

{Y6A071}
[Takeshi]
Huh...? Hey, Tsugumi, hold on. Sora is...


{Y6A072}
[Tsugumi]
Shut up, you.

Tsugumi held up her hand as if silencing
Takeshi.


31 :
[Takeshi]
.........


{Y6A073}
[Tsugumi]
I want to speak to Sora. Alone.


32 :

{Y6A074}
[Tsugumi]
Surely you don't mind?


{T6A157}
[Sora]
"...Of course. Then we will speak in the 
central control room."


{Y6A075}
[Tsugumi]
Alright. Let's go then.


33 :
With serious looks on their faces, the two of
them headed out of the room.


{Y6A076}
[Takeshi]
Hey, wait, you two! What about us!?


{Y6A077}
[Takeshi]
"If it's important, then we should talk about 
it here."


34 :
Tsugumi glared back at Takeshi.

Her eyes were like ice.


{Y6A078}
[Tsugumi]
I told you to shut up, didn't I?


35 :
[Takeshi]
.........


36 :
She turned her back on Takeshi again, and she
and Sora left the conference room.

The room suddenly fell silent.


37 :

{Y6A079}
[Takeshi]
What the hell.


{Y6A080}
[Takeshi]
What the hell is going on here...?


38 :
...................

Those of us left stared at the hologram in the
conference room and settled down to plotting a
strategy to save ourselves.

The four of us (Y¤u, Sara, Takeshi, and I)
gathered around the table.


39 :
We reviewed the facts as we knew them.

There were two ways to get to the surface
from LeMU.

1. Use the elevator in the central area.


2. Climb one of the complex's twelve sets of
emergency stairs.

{16:4}

40 :
The central area floor was completely flooded.

Even if we could get to the elevator,
we couldn't be certain that it would move.

We still didn't know the cause of that either.

The emergency stairs were also filled with
water from the second floor, so they were
impassable.

{16:4}

41 :
There was only one method that could
be used to remove the floodwater.

That was to use the high-pressure fan to pump
the complex full of high-pressure gases and
purge it of seawater.

But at that moment, we weren't able to operate
the fan from inside LeMU.

And like the elevators, we still had no
idea why.

{16:4}

42 :
If we couldn't start it from the inside,
then it could be started from the outside.

But all communication channels to the outside
had been cut off.

And swimming our way to freedom was out of the
question.

The water pressure and other problems made
that suicidal.

{16:4}

43 :
And if we couldn't find a way out on our
own... then we'd have to rely on rescue
efforts from outside.

But that was something we couldn't depend upon.


We hadn't been able to communicate with the
outside for the five days since we'd been
trapped, and there were no signs help was
coming.

So, we knew that we had to exclude a miracle
rescue from our options.

No... From the beginning...

{16:4}

44 :
We had reconciled ourselves with the facts of
our situation long before.

We figured that since there had been no
contact or rescue, not even the slightest
sign, maybe there was a reason
people couldn't get near LeMU.

Or...

Maybe someone had intentionally sealed us in.

So, we came up with three steps we should
focus on.

{16:4}

45 :
A. Restoring communications with the outside.

But that was only relevant if the people on
the outside were willing to cooperate.

{16:4}

46 :
B. Find another way to drain the water from
the complex other than the high-pressure fan.

But according to Sora, there was no other way
to do that.

{16:4}

47 :
C. Find an escape route other than the
elevator or emergency stairs, like maybe
a submarine.

But according to Sora's information, there
were no longer any left at LeMU.

She had said that they all had been used
during the evacuation on May 1st.

{16:4}

48 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}


{16:0}Final conclusion‡L{1}
'Current prognosis for escape: hopeless.'{16:1}

{16:4}

49 :
But there was one thing.

Tsugumi had said that there was an escape
method that only she knew about.

If it did in fact exist...

And there was a way that all six of us could
escape...

Then that would be our only hope.

{16:4}

50 :

{Y6A081}
[Y¤u]
Right!


{Y6A082}
[Takeshi]
There's really nothing we can do.


{Y6A083}
[Sara]
"We'll just have to wait for a report from 
Tsugumi and Sora."

[Kid]
.........


51 :

{Y6A084}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, but Tsugumi hasn't even come back yet.


52 :

{Y6A085}
[Y¤u]
Hmm... She is kind of taking a long time...


{Y6A086}
[Sara]
Maybe there's a reason.

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A087}
[Takeshi]
Maybe.

[Kid]
Hey, should I go see how things are going?


53 :

{Y6A088}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Uh...


{Y6A089}
[Takeshi]
Yeah. You go do that.


{Y6A090}
[Sara]
You're okay alone?

[Kid]
Yeah, fine. I'll just go take a peek.


54 :
With that, I left the conference room.


55 :
I headed down the corridor to the control room.

With the situation the way it was, we weren't
going to find a solution no matter how much
we worried about it.

That was clear.

So, we would have to take control of the
situation.

But how could we do that?

We couldn't just rely on thinking. We needed
to act.

The key to the first step down that path was
in the hands of Tsugumi and Sora.

That was what I believed.


56 :
I arrived in front of the control room.

I pushed the intercom buzzer, but there was no
answer.

My only choice was to open the door.


57 :
When I did, I heard Tsugumi shouting.


{Y6A091}
[Tsugumi]
Don't make me keep repeating the same thing!

Tsugumi and Sora were in the middle of an
argument so intense that it seemed they might
start going at it hand-to-hand.

Neither one would budge. They just glared at
one another.

It looked as though they had been fighting for
several minutes. The room was filled with
tension.

The two glanced at me for only an instant
before launching back into their argument.


58 :

{Y6A092}
[Sora]
"Like I've been telling you, that place just 
does not exist!"


{Y6A093}
[Tsugumi]
Sora, please don't make me any angrier.


{Y6A094}
[Tsugumi]
"You might be able to trick the others, 
but lies won't work on me."


{Y6A095}
[Sora]
It's not a lie!


{Y6A096}
[Tsugumi]
You still sticking to that line?


59 :
It was a bad scene.

Something about the whole thing screamed
danger.

It wouldn't do to let the two go at it like
that.

I retraced my steps, hurrying to the
conference room.


60 :
[Kid]
Everyone! We've got trouble!

Without waiting for the door to completely
open, I bounded into the room.


61 :

{Y6A097}
[Takeshi]
Huh? That was quick...


{Y6A098}
[Takeshi]
Sounds like something big is going down.


{Y6A099}
[Y¤u]
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

[Kid]
C-come on! We've gotta go and stop it!

I told them that as I struggled to get
my breath back.


62 :

{Y6A100}
[Takeshi]
Stop what? Hey, explain what's going on.


{Y6A101}
[Sara]
Wh-what happened?

[Kid]
The central control room...!

[Kid]
Sora and Tsugumi...

[Kid]
...I found them fighting!


{Y6A102}
[Takeshi]
!

[Kid]
I just couldn't watch, so I...


63 :

{Y6A103}
[Y¤u]
This is bad news... at a time like this.


64 :

{Y6A104}
[Sara]
L-let's go! We've got to stop them!


65 :

{Y6A105}
[Takeshi]
Y-yeah! We'd better hurry!


66 :
We burst into the room.

The room was full of sharp words and barbed
looks.

The atmosphere was tense. It left a bad taste
in my mouth.

Nothing had changed at all.

It might be safer to say that things had
gotten worse.


67 :

{Y6A106}
[Sora]
"There aren't any floors underneath Dritter 
Stock. We can't go down any farther."


{Y6A107}
[Tsugumi]
Liar...


{Y6A108}
[Tsugumi]
You're lying.


{Y6A109}
[Tsugumi]
I know... Oh, how I know.


{Y6A110}
[Tsugumi]
"There is another floor under LeMU.
"


{Y6A111}
[Tsugumi]
"No, there's another facility other than 
LeMU... and it's right below us. Really far 
down."


{Y6A112}
[Tsugumi]
I'm right, aren't I?

[Sora]
.........


{Y6A113}
[Sora]
There is only one answer... to your question.


{Y6A114}
[Sora]
No such facilities exist.


{Y6A115}
[Tsugumi]
There have to be!


{Y6A116}
[Tsugumi]
Then what about that room!?


{Y6A117}
[Tsugumi]
What is that Himmel about!?


68 :
...?

Himmel?

I thought I had heard... No, I had seen it
before.

The name of a room...?


69 :
(...Where have I seen it...?)

But my memory was vague; I couldn't connect
the name with any information in my brain.


70 :

{Y6A118}
[Tsugumi]
"Listen. You don't know about it, but today 
the door is..."


71 :

{Y6A119}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Tsugumi!

Suddenly, Takeshi got between them.


{Y6A120}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi... Why don't you tell me about that?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Sora]
.........


{Y6A121}
[Takeshi]
"If we've all heard this much, you can't have 
anything more to hide, right?"

Takeshi stared intently at Tsugumi.


72 :

{Y6A122}
[Tsugumi]
...Hmph.


73 :
Takeshi turned back to us.


74 :

{Y6A123}
[Takeshi]
Hey, if you don't mind...


{Y6A124}
[Takeshi]
I'll take care of this.

[Kid]
Huh?


{Y6A125}
[Y¤u]
What...?


{Y6A126}
[Sara]
Are you telling us to leave?


{Y6A127}
[Takeshi]
"Yeah. With this many people arguing, 
nothing'll get settled."


{Y6A128}
[Takeshi]
So... just leave this to me, Sora, and Tsugumi.


{Y6A129}
[Takeshi]
Leave us alone for a bit.

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Alright... Let's leave this to Takeshi.


75 :

{Y6A130}
[Sara]
K-Kid?


{Y6A131}
[Sara]
"Why should the three of us be excluded from 
such an important discussion?"

[Kid]
I trust Takeshi.

[Kid]
And Takeshi has trust in us.


76 :
[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Takeshi has his own take on things.

[Kid]
And I think we should go with what he thinks.


77 :

{Y6A132}
[Takeshi]
Thanks, Kid...


78 :

{Y6A133}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, whatever... Fine, Kuranari, we'll leave 
it up to you, okay?"


{Y6A134}
[Takeshi]
Alright. I got it.


79 :
We left the three of them in the control room.


80 :
After that, we decided to take some action of
our own.

The estimated time until LeMU's implosion was
steadily approaching.

We decided to run a visual check of the
complex to see how everything was.

Of course, LeMMIH had already checked
everything, so it was a meaningless action.

But we felt that we had to do something.


81 :
I took the corridor near the Cosmic Whale room.

Rather, near what remained of it.

The Cosmic Whale room was already filled with
water.

I wondered what the girl I had seen
around here was? Where had she gone?

Who was the girl singing that lonely
children's song?

Was she a ghost or something else?

Just as I was thinking that...

[Kid]
Uggghh...!

Suddenly, I was hit with a bout of dizziness.

My vision contorted, and I couldn't stand.

I leaned against a wall and slowly crouched
on the floor.

I was unable to focus my mind.

I felt cold...

My joints were throbbing.

[Kid]
Oh, oooowww...!

My stomach felt like it was contracting in on
itself...


82 :
I couldn't stand it and sprinted into the
bathroom.

I threw up everything in my stomach.

.........

It was a stew of half-digested chunks of
tuna sandwich. I looked at it indifferently
and put my hand on my forehead.

I wasn't feverish.

But I felt terrible.


83 :
I took the Ei elevator up to the second floor.

I headed toward the infirmary, intending to get
some medicine.

Along the way, I saw Takeshi.

He was leaning against a wall, muttering.

He was probably just talking to himself, but I
heard what he was saying.


84 :

{Y6A135}
[Takeshi]
"Damn. Nothing's happening... That lying 
woman...!"


{Y6A136}
[Takeshi]
We don't have the time for this...!


85 :
Lying? Woman?

He seemed to be in a bad mood.

[Kid]
H-hey there, Takeshi.


86 :

{Y6A137}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Oh, hey, Kid. What's up?

[Kid]
Uh... How was the talk with Tsugumi and Sora?


87 :

{Y6A138}
[Takeshi]
Oh, that...


{Y6A139}
[Takeshi]
It was no good. Nothing there.

[Kid]
Huh? What do you mean?


{Y6A140}
[Takeshi]
"Tsugumi's got it all wrong. She doesn't know 
what she's talking about."

[Kid]
So the escape route...


{Y6A141}
[Takeshi]
Nah, we're back to square one.

[Kid]
Oh, I see...

I had held out hope that he could pull us
through. It was a bitter disappointment.


88 :

{Y6A142}
[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right! I can't be standing around.

[Kid]
?


{Y6A143}
[Takeshi]
I've gotta run. I've got things to do.


{Y6A144}
[Takeshi]
Later.


89 :
[Kid]
.........

Looking stiff, Takeshi headed off.

I was left alone.


90 :
Sara and Sora were in the infirmary.

It seemed the two of them were having
a complicated discussion.


91 :

{Y6A145}
[Sara]
"So you can get into the Leiblich company 
database through this network, right?"


{Y6A146}
[Sora]
Yes, it is theoretically possible.


{Y6A147}
[Sora]
"But the database at headquarters has security 
that makes what we have here look simple in 
comparison."


{Y6A148}
[Sora]
"Not only is it hard to break into, it will 
hack back at you."


{Y6A149}
[Sora]
"Besides, there are no open communication 
channels with the outside..."


{Y6A150}
[Sara]
"But it's not like the cable connecting us to 
the group is cut off, right?"


{Y6A151}
[Sora]
Correct.


{Y6A152}
[Sara]
"So. even if we can't receive communications. 
we might be able to send them."


{Y6A153}
[Sora]
There is that possibility.


{Y6A154}
[Sara]
In that case...


92 :

{Y6A155}
[Sara]
Huh? Hey, Kid. When did you get here?

[Kid]
I've been here for a bit.


93 :

{Y6A156}
[Sara]
Oh, really? I didn't even notice.


94 :

{Y6A157}
[Sora]
Is something wrong? You don't look so well.

[Kid]
"Yeah... That escape route that Tsugumi was 
talking about..."

[Kid]
So she turned out to be wrong?


95 :

{Y6A158}
[Sora]
Yes, it would appear so.

[Kid]
I see...


96 :

{Y6A159}
[Sora]
"Please do not let it dampen your spirits. 
You can't give up hope."


{Y6A160}
[Sora]
"Like I said this morning, LeMMIH and I are 
doing all we can to get you out of here."

[Kid]
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry...


97 :

{Y6A161}
[Sara]
So what are you doing here, Kid?

[Kid]
"Oh yeah. I came to get some medicine. 
Or some vitamin supplements."


98 :

{Y6A162}
[Sara]
Huh? Are you feeling bad too?

[Kid]
Huh? You too, Sara?


{Y6A163}
[Sora]
"Everyone seems fairly fatigued... Don't 
overdo it."


{Y6A164}
[Sara]
Nakkyu was just here as well.


{Y6A165}
[Sara]
"I guess it's stress. Or maybe lack of sleep. 
And all we've been eating is tuna
sandwiches..."


99 :

{Y6A166}
[Sara]
"And all of those things... are bad for my 
skin."

As she complained, Sara took a jar filled with
tablets from the medicine shelf.


100 :

{Y6A167}
[Sara]
Here you go.

[Kid]
I guess Y¤u took the same ones...

I gulped down the tablets that Sara gave me.

[Kid]
Where did Y¤u go?


{Y6A168}
[Sara]
To the changing room.

[Kid]
Huh? Why? She's going to change?


{Y6A169}
[Sara]
Yeah. I don't know the details, though.

[Kid]
Hmmm.


101 :
At that point, Tsugumi came into the room.

Both Sara's and Sora's expressions tensed.

[Kid]
You too, Tsugumi?


102 :

{Y6A170}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Kid]
"It's weird, but everyone seems to be 
feeling ill today..."

[Kid]
"So I thought that you might be feeling bad 
too."


103 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


{Y6A171}
[Tsugumi]
Not me, I just...


{Y6A172}
[Tsugumi]
I came to check things out.

[Kid]
?


{Y6A173}
[Tsugumi]
"Speaking of weird, I think that guy's lost 
his mind."

[Kid]
That guy...?


104 :

{Y6A174}
[Sara]
Do you mean Takeshi?

Tsugumi nodded.


105 :

{Y6A175}
[Tsugumi]
He's been acting pretty strange.


{Y6A176}
[Tsugumi]
"His eyes are all bloodshot, and he went into 
one of the emergency corridors."


{Y6A177}
[Tsugumi]
"He was breathing funny and acting strange 
too."

(Huh? He seemed in a bad mood... but was he
that out of it?)


{Y6A178}
[Tsugumi]
"He was kind of like that from the start, 
but I think maybe he's lost it."


106 :

{Y6A179}
[Sara]
Huh? What do you mean he was acting strange?


107 :

{Y6A180}
[Sara]
I don't think it could be this, but...

[Kid]
.........

[Sara]
.........


108 :

{Y6A181}
[Sora]
Let me see... Right now... Kuranari-san... is... Um...


{Y6A182}
[Sora]
"Now he is just in the corridor above the 
changing room..."


109 :

{Y6A183}
[Sara]
H-hey! Maybe we should go take a look?

[Kid]
I think you're right!


110 :
Sara and I hurried out of the room.


{Y6A184}
[Sora]
Oh, everyone! He's in the changing room.


111 :
The two of us sprinted to the changing room.


112 :
We arrived in front of it.

There, we heard Y¤u give an ear-splitting
scream.


{Y6A185}
[Y¤u]
Aaaah... Noooo...! What is this!?


113 :
I didn't believe it...! It couldn't be!

[Kid]
Damn! That Takeshi!

The door was shut. We thought it might be
locked from the inside.

I knew it wouldn't work, but I was going to
try to kick open the door.

But Sara stopped me.

Sara went to work on the keypad next to the
door.


114 :
It seemed that she had a code for emergencies
like that. The door opened up.

I immediately burst into the room.


115 :
[Kid]
Hey! Takeshi!


116 :

{Y6A186}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
Eh?

Y¤u was alone in the room...

She had already finished changing.

What?


117 :

{Y6A187}
[Y¤u]
Wha...!


118 :

{Y6A188}
[Y¤u]
"Who do you think you are, bursting in here!? 
Idiot!"


119 :
...Whack!

The magazine Y¤u had thrown at me hit me full
on in the face.

I felt a piercing pain in my nose.


120 :

{Y6A189}
[Sara]
Nakkyu... You're alright?


{Y6A190}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What're you talking about?


{Y6A191}
[Sara]
I... I mean... Takeshi...


{Y6A192}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari? What about him?

Takeshi wasn't anywhere in the room.

Come to mention it, there were no emergency
exits in the room at all.

There was no way for him to enter in from an
emergency corridor.

[Kid]
"What about that scream just a minute ago... 
What was that?"

I rubbed my nose as I said that.


{Y6A193}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that...

Y¤u took the collar of her jacket and showed
it to us.


{Y6A194}
[Y¤u]
"Look at this... It's got a coffee stain on 
it... Do you believe that...?"

There did seem to be a little black stain.


{Y6A195}
[Sara]
Th-that's all...?

[Kid]
You screamed because of that...?


121 :

{Y6A196}
[Y¤u]
Well, yeah.


{Y6A197}
[Y¤u]
I mean, this is my favorite jacket.

[Kid]
"D-don't just freak out like that... And if you're 
done changing, why'd you throw that at me...?"


122 :

{Y6A198}
[Y¤u]
"What're you talking about!? You're the one 
who broke into a room where a girl might 
be changing!"

I looked again at the magazine Y¤u had thrown
at me.

On the cover of the magazine was a glossy
picture of a screw and screwdriver.

It was a copy of 'Monthly Toolbox' magazine.

(What is something like this doing in
the girl's changing room?)

Something red dripped on the floor.

...I had a nosebleed.


123 :

{Y6A199}
[Y¤u]
"Yuck! Why'd you have to go and get 
a nosebleed?"


{Y6A200}
[Y¤u]
"Leave it to someone named 'Kid' to get a 
nosebleed. Talk about ironic."

[Kid]
"It... it's because you threw this 
magazine at me."

I plugged my nose with tissues handed to me by
Sara as I fumbled for an explanation.


124 :

{Y6A201}
[Y¤u]
"Don't tell me... You looked at that magazine 
and...?"


125 :

{Y6A202}
[Y¤u]
Yuck! You're gross!

[Kid]
That's not it!


126 :

{Y6A203}
[Sara]
"*Sigh*... I guess we didn't have anything 
to worry about to start with..."


127 :

{Y6A204}
[Sara]
Oh well...

With that, Sara left the room.

[Kid]
What? Are you leaving?


{Y6A205}
[Sara]
Yup. I've got things to do.

[Kid]
Things?


128 :

{Y6A206}
[Sara]
"Lots. There are things I've got to take 
care of."


129 :
[Kid]
.........

I thought... that I detected a gleam of
determination in Sara's eyes.


130 :

{Y6A207}
[Sara]
So I'll leave the rest to you.


131 :
Sara waved to me as she left.

But an instant later, she had poked her
face back in the room.


132 :

{Y6A208}
[Sara]
Oh, you two...


133 :
[Kid]
?


{Y6A209}
[Y¤u]
?


134 :

{Y6A210}
[Sara]
Take your own sweet time~


135 :
That time, she didn't come back.
