1 :
Before going for repairs, we had to secure
tools.

When the four of us ascended from Zweiter Stock,
we stopped by the warehouse first.

Fortunately, we found the tools we needed
right away.

Pliers, a spanner, a screwdriver, a hammer,
a small welding machine... et cetera, et cetera...

We packed all of the tools we imagined we
might need into a toolbox and headed for the
neutral buoyancy elevator.


2 :
‡LThe neutral buoyancy elevator 'Ei'.

'Ei' meant 'egg' in German.

It was also a literal take on the egg-shaped
elevator that traveled up and down rails into
the ocean on the side of LeMU.

A ballast tank was attached to the floor.

It would take in or release seawater from the
tank as necessary to increase or reduce
buoyancy, making the elevator rise or sink.


3 :
Once we were inside, we sealed the watertight
doors on the LeMU side of the elevator.

All we had to do was release the lock
connecting us to LeMU, and the 'egg' would
sink away.


4 :
Y¤u pulled the operating lever next to the
door.

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Sara]
...

[Y¤u]
...

Nothing happened.


5 :

{S2B000}
[Takeshi]
What's going on? We're not sinking at all.


{S2B001}
[Y¤u]
No... It doesn't seem like it.

[Kid]
Do you think it's because the power is out?


6 :

{S2B002}
[Y¤u]
"No. The Ei elevator is a neutral buoyancy 
elevator, so it basically doesn't require 
outside power."


{S2B003}
[Y¤u]
"But it does need power for the intake and 
release of water for the ballast tank... This 
is the only time it needs power."


7 :

{S2B004}
[Sara]
But we're in a blackout right now...

[Kid]
"...So there's no way to control the ballast 
valve‡Lis that the problem?"


{S2B005}
[Y¤u]
Yes.


8 :

{S2B006}
[Takeshi]
"Oh great. So that means we can't move this 
thing at all then!"


9 :

{S2B007}
[Y¤u]
"Stupid. That's wrong. And you're supposed to 
be a college student?"


10 :

{S2B008}
[Takeshi]
"Well, excuse me! So put it in terms I can 
understand."


11 :

{S2B009}
[Sara]
Professor! I know, I know!


12 :

{S2B010}
[Y¤u]
Alright, Matsunaga-kun.


13 :

{S2B011}
[Sara]
"In order to use buoyancy to rise or sink, 
the weight of the elevator must exceed the 
buoyancy for the object to sink, or vice 
versa."


14 :

{S2B012}
[Y¤u]
That's correct.


{S2B013}
[Y¤u]
You figured it out too, Kid, right?

15 :
{11:0-4d}
{11:1}I got it

{11:1}I don't understand


16 :
[Kid]
Yeah. You mean the Archimedes principle, right?

[Kid]
"The buoyancy of a submerged object is equal 
to the weight of the liquid displaced by the 
object."

[Kid]
"Right now, the buoyancy of the elevator is 
exactly balanced with the elevator's weight."

[Kid]
"So if we make the elevator heavier, it will 
outweigh the buoyancy, and so the elevator
will sink, right?"


17 :

{S2B014}
[Y¤u]
Wow! Good work, you two! What brains!

Y¤u patted our heads as she praised us.


18 :
[Kid]
Sorry... I don't get it at all.


19 :

{S2B015}
[Y¤u]
"Well, the Kid's lost his memory, so it's to be 
expected."


20 :

{S2B016}
[Y¤u]
Alright then, Mayo, how about an explanation?


21 :

{S2B017}
[Sara]
Okay.


22 :

{S2B018}
[Sara]
"The Archimedes principle states that the buoyant 
force on a submerged object is equal to the 
weight of the liquid displaced by the object."


{S2B019}
[Sara]
"That means that right now, the buoyancy of the 
elevator is exactly balanced with the 
elevator's weight."


{S2B020}
[Sara]
"So if we make the elevator heavier, it will 
outweigh the buoyancy..."

[Kid]
And so the elevator will sink, right?


23 :

{S2B021}
[Sara]
You got it.


24 :

{S2B022}
[Y¤u]
Wow! Good work, Mayo! What brains!

Y¤u patted Sara's head as she praised her.


25 :

{S2B023}
[Y¤u]
Smart, smart girl!


26 :

{S2B024}
[Y¤u]
...Not like some other people here.


27 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
"So the reason that Ei won't sink yet is that 
it's not heavy enough, right?"


28 :

{S2B025}
[Y¤u]
Yes. We need to find something heavy...


29 :
We split up and went in search of things we
could use as weights.

And several minutes later...


30 :

{S2B026}
[Takeshi]
Gggrrrrppphh!


31 :
Takeshi was carrying a massive planting pot.


32 :

{S2B027}
[Y¤u]
Heave-ho, heave-ho...


33 :
Y¤u brought a plaster ornament.

And I brought a magazine holder and a bundle
of magazines from the security office.

And Sara...


34 :

{S2B028}
[Sara]
Heave... Heave...

Pull, pull...

[Kid]
S-Sara? That's...


{S2B029}
[Takeshi]
What in the name of...

Sara... was dragging a massive tuna.


35 :

{S2B030}
[Y¤u]
What... happened to that?


36 :

{S2B031}
[Sara]
It was in the corridor over there.


{S2B032}
[Sara]
"I guess it probably washed out from the 
kitchen fridge during the flood."

[Kid]
.........


37 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


38 :

{S2B033}
[Sara]
It's a little cold, but it's okay, right?


39 :
So the four of us packed ourselves into Ei
and headed down to Dritter Stock holding a
frozen tuna.

Ei began to descend ever so slowly...

Peeking through the window and into the blue,
we could see the outside of LeMU.

The blue gradually got darker, and the steel
bulkhead appeared to move farther away upward.

[Kid]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

We were silent during that time.

What was there really to talk about?

No, actually, Y¤u did say one thing...


{S2B034}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, wasn't catching dolphins for food banned 
under some international treaty?"

It seemed that Y¤u was having trouble with the
difference between a dolphin and a tuna.

No one tried to answer her.

I... decided not to think about anything.


40 :
Dritter Stock Sector Seven was another area
sealed off because of flooding.

That was where we got off.

Once the four of us holding the tuna got off,
Ei lost its baggage and floated up to Zweiter
Stock again.

[Kid]
"Oh, no. What'll we do...? We can't get back 
now."


41 :

{S2B035}
[Y¤u]
"No problem. There's one more Ei. I checked, 
and it's stopped on this floor."

[Kid]
Oh... That surprised the heck out of me...


42 :

{S2B036}
[Takeshi]
"HAHAHA... If there wasn't another one, 
there's no way the four of us would ever 
come down here."


43 :

{S2B037}
[Sara]
"You sure? You seemed pretty petrified with 
fear yourself."


44 :

{S2B038}
[Takeshi]
Zip it! I don't want any more lip from you!


45 :

{S2B039}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright... Enough of that. Let's get 
going."


46 :
We put the frozen tuna down and began walking
toward the generator room.

This side of the area was also inundated with
water from the flood.

It was still bathed in darkness.

Blue light from the surface dimly pierced
through the small round windows, making
a wave-like shadow on the floor.

The four of us relied on that and our
flashlight as we proceeded deeper and deeper
into the complex.


47 :

{S2B040}
[Takeshi]
Hey... Wait up!

When we turned a corner, we heard Takeshi
call out from behind us.


48 :

{S2B041}
[Y¤u]
"What are you doing? Hurry up. No dawdling or 
we'll leave you behind."


{S2B042}
[Takeshi]
"I'll show you dawdling! This toolbox weighs 
a ton!"


49 :
Looking back, there was Takeshi with the
toolbox on the floor, breathing hard.


{S2B043}
[Y¤u]
Geez. Gimme a break. Kid, give him a hand.

[Kid]
A-alright.


50 :
I hurried to where Takeshi was.


51 :
[Kid]
Takeshi, I'll help you.


52 :

{S2B044}
[Takeshi]
Thanks. Take it from that side.

[Kid]
Okay.

The two of us took the toolbox from both sides.


53 :

{S2B045}
[Takeshi]
"Whew! Thanks. I thought my arms would fall 
off, carrying it all alone."

[Kid]
Quit exaggerating...

[Kid]
"Oh, Takeshi! Watch out! There's a bump 
sticking out there!"


54 :

{S2B046}
[Takeshi]
Whoa! Th-that was close!

Takeshi was just able to right himself.


55 :

{S2B047}
[Takeshi]
"Whew. That surprised the heck outta 
me... I just about fell down..."


{S2B048}
[Takeshi]
"Glad you noticed that, Kid. It being so dark 
and everything... Good job."

[Kid]
Huh? You really think it's that dark...?

[Kid]
Takeshi, maybe you've got bad night vision.


{S2B049}
[Takeshi]
Hmmm... Could be.


56 :

{S2B050}
[Takeshi]
"What is it that causes that? Lack of vitamin 
A or something? I hate liver and carrots."

[Kid]
You shouldn't be so picky.


57 :
Finally, as we caught up with Y¤u and Sara, we
reached our destination.

Dim yellow and black stripes appeared
ahead.

58 :

{S2B051}
[Takeshi]
This is it? This is the generator room...?

There was a plate with information on the
front of the door, but it was too dark to read.


59 :

{S2B052}
[Y¤u]
I'll take a look.


60 :
Y¤u reached toward the door handle...


61 :
(‡L‡L!?)

[Kid]
Wa-wait a second!

Instinctively, I grabbed Y¤u's arm.


62 :

{S2B053}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what? What is it...?


{S2B054}
[Takeshi]
?


{S2B055}
[Sara]
?

Takeshi and Sara stared at me questioningly.


63 :

{S2B056}
[Y¤u]
What's the matter?

[Kid]
Uh... Um... The thing is...


64 :
I couldn't find the words to reply.

I wondered why I had said what I had.

I really didn't know.

Yet, somehow...


65 :
[Kid]
"If you don't know what's going on inside, 
don't you think it might be dangerous to just 
open the door?"

...I was just rattling off what popped into
my mind.

No, I hadn't even thought it. It just seemed
to jump from my throat before anything else.

Kind of like when you snap your hand back
after touching a hot stove.

I just reflexively blurted it out.


66 :

{S2B057}
[Y¤u]
What do you mean?

Y¤u wasn't buying it.

I took my hand from Y¤u's arm and searched
for words.

At that moment...


67 :

{S2B058}
[Sara]
It's kind of like this...


{S2B059}
[Sara]
"If a pipe carrying hot water burst, then the 
room could be full of hot steam..."

Sara took up the slack in my explanation.


68 :
(Oh, I see...)

While I sensed danger, I couldn't express
in words what it might be.

The three of us nodded, satisfied.


69 :

{S2B060}
[Takeshi]
Okay, let's give it a try.

Takeshi touched his hand to the wet floor.
He went to place his damp fingers on the door.


70 :
The droplets sizzled, evaporating away.


{S2B061}
[Takeshi]
It's true.

It was just like Sara had said.


71 :

{S2B062}
[Takeshi]
Wow... That was pretty sharp, Kid.

[Kid]
Uh... Yeah.

I replied, but I hadn't really known it would
be dangerous either.

The one who had known was a separate someone
inside me.

That someone had simply borrowed my voice.


What had happened was so strange that it made
me feel out of place in my own skin.


{S2B063}
[Sara]
"Anyway, with things as they stand, there's no 
going inside."


72 :

{S2B064}
[Takeshi]
Ooh, shoot.


73 :

{S2B065}
[Y¤u]
I'll say...


{S2B066}
[Y¤u]
"First off, let's close off all the valves for 
pipes sending hot water to the generator room."


{S2B067}
[Y¤u]
"If we stop the flow of hot water, then steam 
should stop flowing to the room."


74 :

{S2B068}
[Sara]
Valves? Where are those?


75 :

{S2B069}
[Y¤u]
"In the room next door. Down one more corridor 
that way."


{S2B070}
[Y¤u]
"It won't require that many people... Just me 
and... one more person to help."


76 :

{S2B071}
[Takeshi]
Alright, leave it to me!


77 :

{S2B072}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Kuranari?


78 :

{S2B073}
[Takeshi]
Hey! What's wrong with me?


79 :

{S2B074}
[Y¤u]
"It's just that... if we're alone, I'm afraid 
that you'll do something."


80 :

{S2B075}
[Takeshi]
Uh, that's...


81 :

{S2B076}
[Sara]
Uh... Maybe I should help?


82 :

{S2B077}
[Y¤u]
Oh no, that's okay. Mayo, you wait here.

[Sara]
.........


83 :

{S2B078}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid. So what're you gonna do?

[Kid]
Huh? Me...?

84 :
{11:0-4f}
{11:1}I'll help Y¤u

{11:1}I'll wait here


85 :
[Kid]
I'm going to help out Y¤u.


86 :

{S2B079}
[Takeshi]
"Okay. In that case, Sara and I will hold down 
the fort here."


87 :

{S2B080}
[Takeshi]
You can't complain about that, right?


{S2B081}
[Y¤u]
Okay.


88 :

{S2B082}
[Takeshi]
Geez. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

It seemed that Takeshi was oblivious to his
disturbing dream the night before.

[Kid]
"I figure that Y¤u is concerned about you in 
her own way."

[Kid]
"Like when she had you carry the heavy 
toolbox... Maybe it was her way of saying 
'rest a bit' or 'take it easy'."


89 :

{S2B083}
[Takeshi]
"You think so? That's a pretty generous 
interpretation, I'd say."


{S2B084}
[Takeshi]
"Oh well. In that case, I guess Sara and 
I will just have to sit back and relax together."


90 :
Takeshi tried to pat Sara on the
shoulder... but she dodged the advance.


91 :

{S2B085}
[Sara]
Oh! You probably don't want to do that.


92 :

{S2B086}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{S2B087}
[Sara]
I'm a licensed Iga Ninja!


93 :

{S2B088}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what's that?


94 :

{S2B089}
[Sara]
"It means that if you value your life you'd 
better stay back!"


95 :
[Takeshi]
..........


96 :

{S2B090}
[Y¤u]
Kid, should we get going?

[Kid]
Uh, yeah...

Y¤u and I left the increasingly tense
atmosphere behind.


97 :
The room was covered in a massive web of pipes.


The pipes continued into the adjacent
generator room. It seemed that by opening
and closing the valves, the water and oil
pressure could be adjusted.


98 :
'Normally, LeMMIH is responsible for
maintaining the generator room, but even
it can't do much when the generator
itself goes out.'

'Anyhow, this is all because the power supply
is down.'

'This room is designed so that maintenance can
be performed manually at times like this, or
during blackouts.'


99 :
...That was what Y¤u told me.

Y¤u selected one pipe from the countless rows
of them and instructed me to close its valve.


100 :
As ordered, I turned the valve around and
around.

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u?

I said that as I was closing the valve.


101 :

{S2B091}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
It's about the girl from yesterday.


{S2B092}
[Y¤u]
"Yesterday? You mean the seventh survivor you 
said you saw?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


102 :

{S2B093}
[Y¤u]
"You're sure your eyes weren't playing tricks 
on you?"

[Kid]
I'm positive. These eyes saw her.


{S2B094}
[Y¤u]
Maybe you've got some kind of eye disease.

[Kid]
Huh? Di-disease...?


103 :

{S2B095}
[Y¤u]
"I'm kidding... It's a joke. Why do you always 
take everything seriously?"

[Kid]
Enough already!


104 :

{S2B096}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright... I'll listen to your 
stories of unidentified survivors later."


{S2B097}
[Y¤u]
Right now, we have to work.


105 :
[Kid]
...


106 :
Finally, the valve was completely shut.


107 :

{S2B098}
[Y¤u]
That should do it.

[Kid]
Y¤u, can we talk now...?


108 :

{S2B099}
[Y¤u]
Let's get back to Kuranari and Sara.


109 :
Y¤u took off from the room as if she were a
fugitive on the run.

I was left in the room alone...

I felt an unclear mess of feelings stewing
inside my mind.


110 :
[Kid]
I'll... wait here.


111 :

{S2B100}
[Takeshi]
So what are we going to do?


{S2B101}
[Y¤u]
"Oh well... Then I'll have to make do with 
Kuranari."


112 :

{S2B102}
[Takeshi]
"Geez. You're a piece of work. Can't you let 
your real feelings show?"


113 :

{S2B103}
[Y¤u]
"Don't be getting any strange ideas. You do 
and I'll knock you down. Got it?"


114 :

{S2B104}
[Takeshi]
"...Take it easy. There's no way I'd try 
something on you, even by mistake."


115 :
When the two of them disappeared at the far
end of the corridor, they were still going at it.



116 :

{S2B105}
[Sara]
Those two...

[Kid]
Yeah?


117 :

{S2B106}
[Sara]
"I don't know, I think they make a pretty good 
couple, don't you?"

[Kid]
Think so?


{S2B107}
[Sara]
"Yeah. Nakkyu is the kind of person who tells 
people she likes what she really thinks... She 
speaks her mind."

[Kid]
Hmmmm.


118 :

{S2B108}
[Sara]
Takeshi kind of seems like that too.

I wasn't sure why... but somehow, I was a little
jealous of Y¤u and Takeshi.

Even if I wanted to, I couldn't open up to
anyone like that... I had nothing to share...


119 :
A while after the two had disappeared...

Sara and I hadn't spoken another word.

The two of us just leaned against a wall and
stared into the darkness.

I was desperately trying to think of some way
to break through the wall that had formed
between us.

[Kid]
Sara, how old are you?

Finally, the words tumbled out of my mouth.


120 :

{S2B109}
[Sara]
"Where did that come from...? I thought 
I told you?"

[Kid]
I don't think so.


121 :

{S2B110}
[Sara]
"I'm a junior. I'm sixteen, and I was born January 
21st. Oh, and I'm an Aquarius."

Sara recited it so smoothly that it was like
she was singing a song.


122 :

{S2B111}
[Sara]
And you, Kid?

[Kid]
I'm...

I didn't know.

When I tried to remember, it was like my mind
would fog over.

I couldn't get close to it. It was like a
mirage in the desert.

[Kid]
I... wonder how old I am.


{S2B112}
[Sara]
You don't know that either?

[Kid]
Nope.


123 :

{S2B113}
[Sara]
Hmmm, that's kind of sad.

[Kid]
Yeah...


124 :

{S2B114}
[Sara]
But maybe it's good in a way.

[Kid]
What do you mean?


125 :

{S2B115}
[Sara]
"Well, maybe it was something that you wanted 
to forget about..."

[Kid]
.........


126 :

{S2B116}
[Sara]
Just kidding.

Sara's expression relaxed into a silly look.

[Kid]
Wh-what... Don't scare me like that.


127 :

{S2B117}
[Sara]
Sorry.


128 :

{S2B118}
[Sara]
"I know. Maybe if I chopped you down we'd 
find out how old you are."

[Kid]
Huh?


{S2B119}
[Sara]
"You know, maybe you've got rings like a tree 
stump."


129 :
[Kid]
...

For some reason, my eyes strayed to the palms
of my hands.

In the darkness, only dimly illuminated by the
emergency lights, my fingers appeared to glow
slightly white.

I still didn't know what had happened to my
finger.


130 :

{S2B120}
[Sara]
Your finger...


131 :
Muttering that, Sara grabbed my finger.

[Kid]
.........

It was so sudden that it put me at a loss for words.

In the darkness, Sara whispered words like she was
confirming something as she gripped my thumb.


{S2B121}
[Sara]
Moon sprite... shouldering... a long bow...


{S2B122}
[Sara]
Waiting... inside a dream...

............

[Kid]
What does that mean?

Sara just shook her head. There was no sign
that she was going to answer me.

She just murmured the words like a spell or a
nursery rhyme as she gently held my thumb.


(A moon sprite...)

I wondered why Sara had suddenly grabbed my
thumb.

Still, I didn't have any urge to pull it away
from her...

As I remained aware of my thumb, I searched
for an answer from Sara's slightly sweaty,
warm palm.


132 :

{S2B123}
[Y¤u]
Thanks for waiting~


133 :

{S2B124}
[Takeshi]
I think we'll be okay now.


{S2B125}
[Y¤u]
It was a hassle looking for the valve, but...


134 :
With the two of them back, Sara finally released my
thumb.

In the darkness, I couldn't make out Sara's expression
very well.

The area around her mouth pulled down
slightly in a sad motion.

Warmth lingered around my thumb...

I didn't know why, but I hesitated to wipe the
warmth away and gently inserted my hand into
my pocket, leaving my thumb extended.


135 :
With that, we had been able to shut off the
hot water flowing to the generator room.

Even so, on the other side of the door, it was
still hot enough to scald.

The four of us waited outside the generator
room until we could be sure that the
temperature inside had cooled enough.


136 :
When we thought the time had come, we timidly
opened the door.

It was like opening the door to a public bath. A
cloud of steam hissed out of the door.


137 :
The heat inside just about defied imagination.

The air in the steam-filled room was heavy and
stuck to the skin.

Inhaling felt like swallowing globs of sticky
hot steam.

Takeshi was opening and closing his mouth like
a fish out of water.


138 :

{S2B126}
[Takeshi]
Isn't it hard to breathe?


{S2B127}
[Y¤u]
"Stop pointing out the obvious! Talking about 
it just makes it worse!"


139 :

{S2B128}
[Sara]
"Nakkyu... Let's just do what we have to do and 
get out of here."


140 :

{S2B129}
[Y¤u]
"Alright. Let's divide up what we have to do 
and be efficient about this."


141 :

{S2B130}
[Y¤u]
"I'll be here. Kuranari, can I get you to go 
over there? Kid, I want you to..."


142 :
And so we got to work fixing the generator.


143 :
Takeshi and Y¤u tackled the main work.

There was hardly anything for Sara and myself
to do, as we knew squat about machines.

We functioned as assistants: shining
flashlights, handing over tools, and loosening
valves as instructed.

After a while, we succeeded in repairing
the generator.


144 :
Takeshi and Y¤u did the bulk of the work.

There wasn't much for Sara or me to do
because we were helpless when it came to
machines.

Takeshi and Sara were working on the other
side of the generator.

Y¤u was doing battle with the machine and
depending on my flashlight-wielding skills.

With nothing much to do, my thoughts started
wandering.

And of course they led right to the girl that
had disappeared.

I just couldn't believe that I had imagined
the whole thing.


145 :
[Kid]
Hey, you know, I've thought a lot about it...


{S2B131}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
About the girl.


{S2B132}
[Y¤u]
What? You still stuck on that?

[Kid]
Just listen.

[Kid]
Maybe that girl...

[Kid]
Maybe she's a ghost.


146 :

{S2B133}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


147 :
Y¤u gave me a fed up look, shook her head, and
went back to work.

[Kid]
That's gotta be it!

[Kid]
"That would explain why the numbers change so 
irregularly and why she vanished all of a 
sudden."


{S2B134}
[Y¤u]
That's stupid...

[Kid]
Listen! I'm serious.


{S2B135}
[Y¤u]
No.


{S2B136}
[Y¤u]
"If you were talking about something serious, 
I would take you seriously."


{S2B137}
[Y¤u]
"But I'm not listening seriously to something 
like this. Stupidity is contagious."


{S2B138}
[Y¤u]
"It's like multiplication of pluses and 
minuses..."


{S2B139}
[Y¤u]
A plus times a plus is a plus.


{S2B140}
[Y¤u]
But a minus times a plus is a minus...


{S2B141}
[Y¤u]
"So pass me that minus-like screwdriver, 
would you?"

I suppressed my anger and put the flat-head
screwdriver in Y¤u's hand.

[Kid]
"Okay then, you don't have to listen 
seriously."

[Kid]
Just listen to me stupidly.


148 :

{S2B142}
[Y¤u]
What's that mean? Listen stupidly...

[Kid]
It's multiplication, right?

[Kid]
A minus times a minus is a plus, right?


{S2B143}
[Y¤u]
I see.


149 :

{S2B144}
[Y¤u]
"Okay. I'll listen to the stupid 
stuff you've got to say until I finish 
screwing in these screws."


{S2B145}
[Y¤u]
So? What is it you're dying to say?

[Kid]
It's about the girl that disappeared.

[Kid]
If she were a ghost...


{S2B146}
[Y¤u]
"Hold on. Now, do you really believe in 
ghosts?"

[Kid]
"I wouldn't say believe. But believe in the 
possibility..."


{S2B147}
[Y¤u]
"Zero. That is what possibility there is. 
Maybe 0.000000000000000001%."

[Kid]
How do you know?


150 :
Y¤u sighed and started turning the next screw.


{S2B148}
[Y¤u]
"Listen. Ghost stories, now and forever, are 
almost all made up."


{S2B149}
[Y¤u]
"They're just fiction with the goal of 
entertaining people."

[Kid]
"But haven't you ever felt somebody's eyes on 
you when you were in a room all alone?"


{S2B150}
[Y¤u]
Eyes?

[Kid]
"Yeah. Like someone was watching you from 
behind..."


{S2B151}
[Y¤u]
You mean your mom?

[Kid]
I'm being serious... Oh, never mind.


{S2B152}
[Y¤u]
Things like that are just your imagination.


{S2B153}
[Y¤u]
"A product of an overzealous mind. A delusion
spawned by the mental state of the person."

[Kid]
You mean my mind is playing tricks on me?


{S2B154}
[Y¤u]
To be perfectly blunt, yes.


{S2B155}
[Y¤u]
"UFOs and goblins are the same thing. People 
like to imagine stuff."


{S2B156}
[Y¤u]
"Thanks to the power of imagination, people 
have been able to evolve to where we are, but 
it's kind of a curse too."


{S2B157}
[Y¤u]
"Taken to extremes, there is no distinguishing 
between reality and delusions."

[Kid]
.........


{S2B158}
[Y¤u]
"When you turn on the lights, the ghost is 
only a shirt on a chair."


{S2B159}
[Y¤u]
"People who want to be scared see what they 
want."


{S2B160}
[Y¤u]
"If you really want to believe that something 
exists, even if it doesn't, then you still 
feel that it does."


{S2B161}
[Y¤u]
"If you're scared of something, you'll scare 
yourself even if there's nothing there."

151 :
{11:0-51}
{11:1}Keep arguing

{11:1}Give up


152 :
[Kid]
"What about sleep paralysis? How do you explain 
that?"


{S2B162}
[Y¤u]
Sleep paralysis?

[Kid]
When you wake up and you can't move.

[Kid]
Is that just a person's mind too?


{S2B163}
[Y¤u]
"They probably can't move because somebody 
tied them up when they were asleep."

[Kid]
Who?


{S2B164}
[Y¤u]
Some SM freak.

[Kid]
As if that could happen!


{S2B165}
[Y¤u]
I'm kidding...


{S2B166}
[Y¤u]
"You're talking about when your body is still 
asleep but your mind is awake."


{S2B167}
[Y¤u]
"So that even though you're conscious, your 
body won't move."

[Kid]
"What about the people that say they wake up 
and saw a ghost on top of them?"


{S2B168}
[Y¤u]
"They think their eyes are open, but it's 
really just a dream."


{S2B169}
[Y¤u]
"Because the brain is fully awake and the 
body won't do what it's told, a person feels 
fear. These two things happen at the same 
time..."


{S2B170}
[Y¤u]
"So even the most incredible dream seems like 
reality."

[Kid]
.........


{S2B171}
[Y¤u]
"I just told you, right? If you really, really 
believe something, then even reality seems like 
a delusion."


153 :
[Kid]
.........

I wasn't satisfied, but I had learned
something...

I couldn't beat Y¤u in a debate.


154 :

{S2B172}
[Y¤u]
So? Doesn't look like you're convinced.

[Kid]
You can't convince me. I know... I saw her.

[Kid]
At least I saw something.


{S2B173}
[Y¤u]
"Don't go telling me you have special powers 
to see spirits or anything either."

[Kid]
.........


155 :

{S2B174}
[Y¤u]
You're not gonna say it, right?

[Kid]
.........


156 :

{S2B175}
[Y¤u]
Alright, alright.


{S2B176}
[Y¤u]
"But no spinning your head around 360 degrees 
or spewing out ectoplasmic goo. Alright?"


{S2B177}
[Y¤u]
"And no supernatural tricks or channeling 
spirits either."


{S2B178}
[Y¤u]
"Because if a poltergeist gets loose around 
here, the screws I just put in could fall out."

[Kid]
"For not believing this stuff, you sure know a 
lot about it."


{S2B179}
[Y¤u]
"It's because I don't believe in it that 
I know a lot."


{S2B180}
[Y¤u]
My knowledge is not for defensive purposes.


{S2B181}
[Y¤u]
It's for offensive ones.

[Kid]
Huh?


{S2B182}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, there are those people that swear by 
ghosts, the supernatural, UFOs, and that occult 
stuff. They're completely loony."


{S2B183}
[Y¤u]
"My knowledge is so I can take them down when 
I meet them."


{S2B184}
[Y¤u]
"I've stocked up on enemy information for 
my verbal assaults."


{S2B185}
[Y¤u]
That's the reason I majored in archaeology.

[Kid]
Archaeology?

[Kid]
"Archaeology... I thought that was about 
digging, looking for artifacts and ruins, and 
deciphering ancient letters. That kind of 
stuff, right?"


{S2B186}
[Y¤u]
Well, maybe.

Y¤u studying archaeology... It just didn't click.


[Kid]
So what are you studying?


{S2B187}
[Y¤u]
"I'm not doing anything that big. I'm still a 
freshman, so I'm only taking basic stuff."


{S2B188}
[Y¤u]
"I just listen to professors lecture and go on 
excavation surveys. I'm still getting the 
fundamentals of 'What is archaeology?' pounded 
into my head."

[Kid]
Hmmm.

[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me. Speaking of 
archaeology... Y¤u, have you ever 
heard of the continent Lemuria?"

[Kid]
"It seems like it's the origin of LeMU's 
name."


{S2B189}
[Y¤u]
"Have I heard of it...? I know so much about 
it that it makes me nuts."

[Kid]
?


{S2B190}
[Y¤u]
"Lemuria is the phantom continent that is said 
to have existed from 200 million to 50 million 
years B.C."


{S2B191}
[Y¤u]
"On it thrived an advanced civilization that 
was more advanced than what we have today, but 
it just slipped down to the bottom 
of the ocean overnight."

Y¤u recited it off so fluently that it sounded
like she was reading from a textbook.

(Advanced civilization... Overnight... Huh?)

(That sounds just like...)


{S2B192}
[Y¤u]
"There are some scholars that contend that 
this continent was the origin of mankind."


{S2B193}
[Y¤u]
"But what could they be talking about? 
That could never happen."

[Kid]
You don't believe it?


157 :

{S2B194}
[Y¤u]
"Of course not. Archaeologically and 
geologically, the idea has no basis."


{S2B195}
[Y¤u]
"The more real research is conducted, the more 
the theory is shot full of holes... It's no 
longer a legitimate field of study."

[Kid]
Is that right...?


158 :

{S2B196}
[Y¤u]
Reality is different from a fairy tale.


{S2B197}
[Y¤u]
"Religion is like that too. Any and all of those 
mysterious things that people get all worked 
up about. They're mostly all make believe."


{S2B198}
[Y¤u]
"Since it's all impossible to prove in the first 
place, they can say whatever they want. That's the 
philosophy behind it."

[Kid]
.........

I thought that maybe precisely because there
was no evidence for or against it, what
people said was actually packed with meaning.

I felt like that because those words were the
only foothold, the only way to really nail
down reality.

I absently thought about that for a minute.


{S2B199}
[Y¤u]
Hmmmmgggr... This screw is really tight.

[Kid]
Let me try.


159 :
We switched places, and I tried twisting the
screw into place.


160 :

{S2B200}
[Y¤u]
"Ohhhh. I'm beat... My shoulders are stiff and 
everything."

Y¤u twisted and stretched. Her back popped
loudly.

[Kid]
"Hey. You know what we were just talking 
about..."


161 :

{S2B201}
[Y¤u]
What was that? Oh, Lemuria?

[Kid]
Yeah.


162 :

{S2B202}
[Y¤u]
"Kid... You're not one of those people that get 
all into these stories, are you?"

[Kid]
"I... I don't know about that. But since we've 
got time to kill, just humor me."


{S2B203}
[Y¤u]
Alright, alright. What is it?

[Kid]
"Okay. I wonder if Lemuria angered God and he 
sent it to the bottom of the ocean?"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"That is, if the people of Lemuria had such an 
advanced civilization, maybe God struck them 
down for their pride or something..."

[Kid]
Huh? Y¤u?

[Y¤u]
...............

[Kid]
Hellllllllloooooo?


163 :

{S2B204}
[Y¤u]
"This is bad. DANGER, DANGER! I'm putting 
myself in danger of being dragged into lunacy 
with you."


164 :

{S2B205}
[Y¤u]
Stupid... Stupid...


165 :

{S2B206}
[Y¤u]
Alright. I should be fine now.

[Kid]
...


166 :

{S2B207}
[Y¤u]
"Okay, okay. I see what you're saying. You're 
saying that it was like the Tower of Babel, 
right?"

[Kid]
Tower of Babel?


{S2B208}
[Y¤u]
"In the old testament, in Genesis, there's 
this story about this tower."


{S2B209}
[Y¤u]
"In it, people are so proud of their 
achievements that they build this super high 
tower... this massive structure that almost 
reached to heaven."


{S2B210}
[Y¤u]
But God was angered by their behavior.


{S2B211}
[Y¤u]
"God said, 'I will bring down their pride 
together with the trickery of their hands. 
They are impudent.'"


{S2B212}
[Y¤u]
"So God took it upon himself to destroy the 
tower, and the building stopped, and people 
spread to all corners of the earth."


{S2B213}
[Y¤u]
That's the story of the Tower of Babel.

[Kid]
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

I nodded without stopping my work.


167 :

{S2B214}
[Y¤u]
"That would have to be the work of a god like 
Shiva."

[Kid]
Shiva?


{S2B215}
[Y¤u]
The god of destruction and creation.


{S2B216}
[Y¤u]
"One of the main three Hindu gods. He has 
more than a thousand names, four arms, four 
faces, and three eyes."


{S2B217}
[Y¤u]
"He destroys the world for the purpose of 
creation..."


{S2B218}
[Y¤u]
"The destruction is so thorough that in it is 
contained the seeds or possibility of the next 
generation."

[Kid]
"Kind of like starting from square one is 
better than fixing something halfway?"


168 :

{S2B219}
[Y¤u]
Maybe.


{S2B220}
[Y¤u]
"So if Lemuria had pissed off a god enough to 
sink it into the ocean, then that god would 
probably have demolished it."

[Kid]
Oh, I see...

(A god that would purge the world of filth by
destroying it...)

(A god that damned people drunk with pride
and forced rebirth...)


169 :

{S2B221}
[Y¤u]
"Look! You're slowing down. Hurry and 
finish up."

[Kid]
I'm already done.

I had finished putting in all of the screws.


170 :

{S2B222}
[Y¤u]
Next, tighten these bolts.

I handed the screwdriver to her and took
the wrench.

Somewhere along the line, I had been put in
charge of the work.


171 :
When Y¤u pointed the flashlight near me, I saw
three bolts in the shape of a triangle.

[Kid]
Did you say that Shiva has three eyes?


{S2B223}
[Y¤u]
Yup.

[Kid]
That means...


172 :
I put the wrench between my eyebrows.

[Kid]
He'd have another eye right here then?


173 :

{S2B224}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


{S2B225}
[Y¤u]
"The light from that third eye burns all in 
the world, purifying it."

[Kid]
Wow... That sounds pretty cool.

I said that as I tightened the top bolt.

[Kid]
"But I bet a visit to the optometrist would 
be a pain."


174 :

{S2B226}
[Y¤u]
"Well, you'd have to buy another lens, so the 
optometrist would love it."

I thought to myself that making the custom
frame is what would cost a fortune.
But I didn't dare say it.


175 :

{S2B227}
[Y¤u]
That's enough of that...


176 :

{S2B228}
[Y¤u]
"But the idea of a 'third eye' is not limited to 
Shiva. It also exists in the world of Buddhism 
and Yoga."


{S2B229}
[Y¤u]
"Clairvoyance, telescopic vision, ghost sense, 
the gift of the prophet, the power of seeing 
the past or future..."


{S2B230}
[Y¤u]
"There are a lot of explanations behind it. 
Some say it's a gift from the gods, others 
that you can acquire it from intensive 
training. But what they all have in common is..."

When the third eye opens, true wisdom is
apparent, and all becomes visible.


177 :

{S2B231}
[Y¤u]
"They all have something to do with 
transcending the realm of the human... Becoming 
superhuman somehow."

[Kid]
Real wisdom...

Muttering that, I turned to face the bolt again.


178 :
(If I had that, I'd be able to get back my
memory... Yeah right...)

[Kid]
If there really is such a thing, I want one.


179 :

{S2B232}
[Y¤u]
You want what...? A third eye?

[Kid]
"Yeah. If I had one, maybe I could see my 
past. And maybe I'd know who that girl is."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Anyway, I'd like to see what it's like.


180 :

{S2B233}
[Y¤u]
You want to see?

[Kid]
Yeah. Maybe I could see something.


181 :

{S2B234}
[Y¤u]
Shall I give you a look then?

[Kid]
What?

I looked up.

And there...


182 :
Was Y¤u's face.

(Wh-when did she get so close?)

We were at a distance where could just about
feel each other's breath.

The tips of our noses just about touched.
That was how close her face was.

[Kid]
Y-Y¤u...?


183 :

{S2B235}
[Y¤u]
You want to see, right?

Y¤u stared me in the eye as she said that.

[Kid]
.........

I couldn't speak. My legs shook.

My heart was beating as fast as it would go.
It felt like it would jump right out of
my chest.


184 :

{S2B236}
[Y¤u]
Now, take a good look.

Y¤u lifted up her bangs and placed her
finger on her forehead.


{S2B237}
[Y¤u]
Right here, isn't it?


{S2B238}
[Y¤u]
The third eye...

[Kid]
.........

On Y¤u's face...

There was nothing.

All I could think about was her nice skin and
sweet smell.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........


185 :

{S2B239}
[Y¤u]
Ah! Hahahaha~


186 :
Y¤u grabbed her stomach, laughing.

[Kid]
Huh? What?


{S2B240}
[Y¤u]
It's a JOKE! A JOKE!

[Kid]
What...?


{S2B241}
[Y¤u]
Hahaha! That was too funny.


{S2B242}
[Y¤u]
"Who else would take that completely 
seriously... You're the best."

[Kid]
You're... You're so mean... Y¤u.

[Kid]
"You tease me even though you know how serious 
I am."


187 :

{S2B243}
[Y¤u]
"Sorry! Oh, I'm sorry! But you keep saying one 
bizarre thing after another, so I just 
couldn't help playing a joke on you."


188 :

{S2B244}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, what I said wasn't really a lie 
anyway."

Saying that, Y¤u pointed to her forehead again.

[Kid]
What do you mean?


189 :
I wondered why we only had two eyes.

Common knowledge had it that, physically, two
eyes were enough for gauging the distance to
a point or focusing on something.

But what would it be like if we really used
to have three eyes?

{16:4}

190 :
Actually...

The animal ancestors of vertebrates had three
eyes.

Early species of primitive reptiles...

Like the tuatara lizard that still had a third
eye on the top of its head.

{16:4}

191 :
‡LThe third eye.

{1}

192 :
The organ had a similar function to the
eyeball and lay on the top of the head.

That organ would be sensitive to the light of
the outside world and control internal hormone
secretion and balance based on light.

An eye on the crest of one's head would stare
straight up. It seemed safe to say that it
would sense the difference in light between
day and night.

{16:4}



193 :
A right eye, a left eye, and one above...




An eye on the top of the head to stare at the
sky.

Only we people and higher vertebrates had lost
the third eye over a long process of
evolution. It had been covered over by the
cerebrum, and we lost our ability to sense
light directly.

Therefore, we had two light sensitive eyeballs,
one on each side, instead.

The lost third eye was called a 'pineal body'.

{16:4}

194 :
It had functioned in the brain for eons and
was responsible for secreting hormones that
helped carve out our 24-hour rhythm.

What we called our 'internal clocks' existed
because of the pineal body.

{16:4}

195 :
...That was essentially the rundown that Y¤u
gave me as I was tightening the bolts.


{S2B245}
[Y¤u]
"So the third eye, in terms of human anatomical 
science, is really no big deal."


{S2B246}
[Y¤u]
"It's just an organ we lost through 
evolution..."

[Kid]
"You mean like an appendix or the webbing 
between fingers?"


{S2B247}
[Y¤u]
That's exactly what I mean.

[Kid]
I finished with the bolt.


196 :

{S2B248}
[Y¤u]
Okay. Well then, our work here is done.


197 :

{S2B249}
[Y¤u]
Oh... I'm tired.

Y¤u stretched as she said that.

I put both hands on my waist and stretched.

We were both drenched in sweat.


198 :
[Kid]
Hey, I was wondering...


199 :

{S2B250}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
"So that occult stuff that you were just 
telling me about is for offensive purposes 
too?"


200 :

{S2B251}
[Y¤u]
"Well... it's not really for offensive or 
defensive use."


201 :

{S2B252}
[Y¤u]
It's just a load of useless knowledge.


202 :

{S2B253}
[Y¤u]
Still, I can't very well just throw it away.


{S2B254}
[Y¤u]
"Maybe it's completely rooted itself into my 
brain."

[Kid]
But you planted it there yourself, right?


203 :

{S2B255}
[Y¤u]
No way!


204 :

{S2B256}
[Y¤u]
My mom's the guilty one.

[Kid]
Your mom?


205 :

{S2B257}
[Y¤u]
Yes. My mom's an archaeological researcher.


{S2B258}
[Y¤u]
"Apparently, she's an expert in the ancient 
concept of the third eye..."


{S2B259}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, when I was little, she told me all 
these third eye stories instead of 
lullabies."

[Kid]
Wow...

(Hmmm? The third eye?)

How about that? I wondered if the third eye
could be related to something.

I thought I would ask about possible
connections, but my mind and body were
completely drained.

(Oh well... I'll save it for next time.)


206 :

{S2B260}
[Y¤u]
I used to hate archaeology...

Y¤u sighed as she said that.


207 :

{S2B261}
[Y¤u]
"But one day, I just woke up and found myself 
in the archaeology department."

[Kid]
Like mother, like daughter?


208 :

{S2B262}
[Y¤u]
It's not that simple.

Y¤u's shoulders slumped, and she let out a deep
sigh again.


209 :

{S2B263}
[Y¤u]
It's like some kind of curse.


210 :
Soon after that, it looked like Takeshi and
Sara had finished their work as well.

Well, it had turned into an adventure, but at
least we had finished the repairs.


211 :
It was just like Sara had said. The cause of
the blackout was the opening of the safety
valve due to the drop in air pressure.

'When pressure from the steam becomes
excessive, the valve automatically opens to
release the gas and prevent damage.'

'Normally, after a release of surplus gas, the
valve is designed to shut naturally... but
we're only at one atmosphere.'

'Because the safety valve never closed, the
steam continued leaking.'

...Anyway, that was the gist of the
explanation.


212 :
We left the generator room and went to the
pipe room...


213 :
There, we opened the valve we had closed
before the repairs...


214 :
And returned to the generator room.


215 :

{S2B264}
[Takeshi]
So should we try to fire it up?

Takeshi whispered the question as we stood in
front of the generator switch.


{S2B265}
[Takeshi]
I'm turning it on.

Sara, Y¤u, and I nodded silently.


{S2B266}
[Takeshi]
You ready?

[Kid]
Just do it.


216 :

{S2B267}
[Takeshi]
Pipe down, Kid.


217 :

{S2B268}
[Takeshi]
Let's start the countdown...


{S2B269}
[Takeshi]
50 seconds to...


{S2B270}
[Sara]
Huh? From 50?


{S2B271}
[Takeshi]
45 seconds to...

Takeshi continued, ignoring her.


{S2B272}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, that's too long...


{S2B273}
[Takeshi]
40... 39... 38...

It was irritating.


{S2B274}
[Takeshi]
37... 36... 35...

So irritating...


{S2B275}
[Takeshi]
34...


218 :
‡LClick.


219 :
All three of us except Takeshi pushed the
button.


220 :

{S2B276}
[Takeshi]
"Hey! What're you doing? We still have 34 
seconds to go!"

[Kid]
"Nobody wants to wait 34 seconds. Somebody had 
to push it!"


{S2B277}
[Takeshi]
"You guys can't even wait a little more than 
a simple 30 seconds?"


221 :

{S2B278}
[Y¤u]
Why wait!?


222 :

{S2B279}
[Takeshi]
"This... This is kind of like a 
ritual... Anyway, it's very important..."


223 :
The lights lit up all at once.

The light poured down, illuminating even the
corners of the room.

It was like our field of vision had expanded
in an instant.


224 :

{S2B280}
[Sara]
Seventeen...


225 :

{S2B281}
[Takeshi]
What?


{S2B282}
[Sara]
"The lights came on with seventeen seconds left 
in the countdown."


226 :

{S2B283}
[Y¤u]
What are you talking about?


227 :

{S2B284}
[Sara]
"You don't understand? The power came back on 
with seventeen seconds left to count."

[Kid]
Oh, I see...

I understood what she was saying.

[Kid]
"You mean if we would have pushed it at seventeen 
seconds, it would have been just right?"


228 :

{S2B285}
[Sara]
Yeah.


229 :

{S2B286}
[Y¤u]
Ahaha! That would have been something.


{S2B287}
[Takeshi]
Tsk.

I wasn't sure if Takeshi was over his anger,
but he shouldered the heavy toolbox and left
the room.


230 :
We retraced our path until we were in front
of the neutral buoyancy elevator.

The frozen tuna's empty eyes were waiting
for us.

The elevator we had used coming down had
already floated up to Zweiter Stock.

But to the left... the floor display was lit
up with a number three.


231 :

{S2B288}
[Takeshi]
Oh, this is heavy.

Takeshi groaned as he put the toolbox on the
floor of the elevator.


232 :

{S2B289}
[Sara]
You sound like an old man...


233 :

{S2B290}
[Takeshi]
Shut up. I AM an old man compared to you.


234 :
While they needled each other, I pushed the up
button next to the door.

The internal and external watertight doors had
already sealed automatically.


235 :
We could hear air being sent into the ballast
tank under the floor.

Finally, the egg-shaped elevator...


236 :
...Didn't start to float up.


237 :

{S2B291}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Are you serious?

The sound beneath the floor had stopped, and
silence had returned.


{S2B292}
[Sara]
Not again...


238 :

{S2B293}
[Y¤u]
"Why do we keep running into problem after 
problem...?"


239 :
Knowing it was useless, I pushed the up button
repeatedly.


240 :
Of course, Ei didn't budge at all.


241 :
[Kid]
Alright, so what do we do...?

Just as I said that...


242 :
A monitor just to the right of the round
window flickered to life.


{S2B294}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, Tanaka-san, Matsunaga-san,
Kid-san."


243 :

{S2B295}
[Takeshi]
"Sora! Where have you been? We looked 
everywhere for you!"


{S2B296}
[Sora]
"I am terribly sorry. Please accept 
my apologies."

The image of Sora in the monitor bowed deeply.


244 :

{S2B297}
[Y¤u]
That's not important right now.


245 :
I didn't have any major suspicions about
Sora's disappearance during the blackout.

I knew that she was an RSD-generated image.


246 :

{S2B298}
[Y¤u]
Sora? So we fixed the generator?


{S2B299}
[Sora]
It would appear so.


{S2B300}
[Sora]
Thank you so much. Thank you...


247 :

{S2B301}
[Takeshi]
"I think you know this, but we're in this 
egg... Uh, this Ei..."


{S2B302}
[Sora]
Yes, I know.


248 :

{S2B303}
[Sora]
The Ei is not moving, correct?


249 :

{S2B304}
[Sara]
What should we do?


{S2B305}
[Sora]
First, in regard to the cause...


{S2B306}
[Sora]
"It is likely the result of a decrease in 
internal air pressure that has made the 
device incapable of sufficiently expelling 
the seawater in the ballast tank."


250 :

{S2B307}
[Sora]
In other words...

[Kid]
You mean it isn't buoyant enough?


251 :

{S2B308}
[Sora]
Correct.


{S2B309}
[Sora]
"There are a number of feasible methods for 
making it rise, but..."


252 :
In the end, we decided to split into pairs to
ride the elevator.

In line with the principle of Archimedes... if
the buoyancy was insufficient, we had to
lighten the load.

First, Sara and I got in Ei.


253 :
Sora and Tsugumi were waiting at Zweiter Stock.


{S2B310}
[Sora]
Good work, you two.

[Tsugumi]
.........

Sora beamed a welcoming smile at us.

Tsugumi just stood there staring at Sara
and me.


254 :
Next came Y¤u...

And then the tuna took the elevator to
return to our floor.


255 :

{S2B311}
[Y¤u]
This is... c-c-cold...


256 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

I noticed that when Tsugumi saw Y¤u cradling
the frozen fish, she grinned for the first
time.


257 :
Sora, on the other hand...


258 :

{S2B312}
[Sora]
A-a-are you alright!? Kuranari-san!

...Sora ran up next to the fish in a panic.


259 :

{S2B313}
[Sara]
Uh, Nakkyu... You brought along the fish?


260 :

{S2B314}
[Y¤u]
"Of course. It's food, after all. Waste not, 
want not, right?"


261 :

{S2B315}
[Sora]
"Forget that for now... More 
importantly... Kuranari-san..."

Sora was still flustered and babbling next
to the fish.

I wondered if she really thought that Takeshi
had turned into a tuna.


262 :

{S2B316}
[Sora]
"This is all my fault... Oh my gosh! 
What can I do?"


263 :

{S2B317}
[Takeshi]
Uh... I know you're occupied, but...


264 :

{S2B318}
[Sora]
Huh?


265 :

{S2B319}
[Takeshi]
"I think the question is more what should I 
do."
