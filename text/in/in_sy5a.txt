1 :
‡LThe Lemurian Ruins.

Just like I had the day before, I visited
the ruins.

I figured I would find Y¤u there.

It felt like I had traveled through time and
opened the door to an ancient land.

Speaking of time travel...

Y¤u had scoffed at it, but I still hadn't
given up on the theory.

It was the only one that made sense to me.

There was no other way to explain things.


2 :
I entered the ruins.

I continued through the maze-like passages.

Trying not to get lost, I wracked my memory...

Fortunately, I remembered the path I'd taken
the day before.

It was still fresh in my mind.

It was like I had been through the area
dozens of times.

Finally...


{Y5A000}
[Y¤u]
Yahoo~


3 :
I found Y¤u.

She was in the same spot as the day before‡Lthe
Sun Temple.

And she was sitting on the same obelisk,
hugging her knees.

I sat down next to her.

[Kid]
Do you feel better now?


{Y5A001}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. Thanks to you.

[Kid]
That's good to hear.


{Y5A002}
[Y¤u]
"You did a good job of finding this place 
again."

[Kid]
It was the only place I could think of.


{Y5A003}
[Y¤u]
"That's not what I mean... I mean you 
remembered the route here."

[Kid]
"What are you talking about? You called me 
here, right?"


{Y5A004}
[Y¤u]
That's right.

[Kid]
"Don't tell me you thought that I wouldn't 
find my way back!"


{Y5A005}
[Y¤u]
Well, yeah.

[Kid]
.........


{Y5A006}
[Y¤u]
I'm kidding. It's a joke!


{Y5A007}
[Y¤u]
"To tell you the truth, I just wanted to test 
you."

[Kid]
Test? Me?


4 :

{Y5A008}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{Y5A009}
[Y¤u]
"I wanted to see if you could navigate the 
labyrinth, slay the evil dragon, and rescue the 
princess held captive here."


{Y5A010}
[Y¤u]
To see whether the hero would show up or not.


{Y5A011}
[Y¤u]
I wanted to test the prince on the white horse.

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
You... You heard that from Sara, right?


5 :

{Y5A012}
[Y¤u]
Right.

[Kid]
And you're supposed to be the princess?


{Y5A013}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I don't want to sound too full of 
myself, but..."

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
I'm going back.

I stood up.


6 :

{Y5A014}
[Y¤u]
"Oh! You're mean! What? I'm not good enough 
for you!?"

[Kid]
"That's not it at all. I just can't handle 
this kind of game right now."

[Kid]
"I'm completely worn out. And I've got this 
broken arm."


7 :

{Y5A015}
[Y¤u]
Oh, your arm...

Y¤u belatedly noticed my arm...


8 :
Standing, I went to return on the road that
I had used in coming.

But Y¤u came after me.


9 :

{Y5A016}
[Y¤u]
Hey, I said wait just a second!

[Kid]
"Leave me alone! If all you want to do is talk 
about your stupid fantasies, I'd rather get 
some sleep."


10 :

{Y5A017}
[Y¤u]
You got hurt... trying to help me...

[Kid]
.........


11 :

{Y5A018}
[Y¤u]
It's a battle scar you can be proud of.

(She just won't give up...)

As I was about to complain...

Y¤u gently laid her hand on my hard cast.


12 :

{Y5A019}
[Y¤u]
Does it still hurt?

[Kid]
...Only a little.

I lied.

Thanks to the medicine, it didn't really hurt
at all.


13 :

{Y5A020}
[Y¤u]
You want me to cast a spell on it for you?

[Kid]
A spell?


{Y5A021}
[Y¤u]
"Yup. I learned it straight from my mom. It's 
guaranteed to work."


{Y5A022}
[Y¤u]
It's my way of saying I'm sorry.

[Kid]
.........

Y¤u put both her hands on my cast, as if
enveloping it, and gently started rubbing it.

I just stood there.

I could feel the heat from her palms through
the cast.

As she lightly stroked my arm, Y¤u started
whispering.


{Y5A023}
[Y¤u]
"Chichin puipui, pain, pain, go fly away! Far beyond 
the Andromeda nebula..."


14 :
[Kid]
...Chichin puipui?


{Y5A024}
[Y¤u]
How is it? The pain stopped, right?

[Kid]
...Far beyond the Andromeda nebula?


15 :

{Y5A025}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what? Is there a problem?

[Kid]
Ha... Heehee... Nope... Nope... Heeeee...

All of a sudden, I had a wild urge to laugh.

It was something I never thought I'd hear come
out of Y¤u's mouth.

And it tickled me incredibly.

[Kid]
Yeah... It looks like you completely fixed it.

My irritation vanished.


16 :

{Y5A026}
[Y¤u]
Oh, good. I hoped I would!

We decided to go back to the hall.


17 :

{Y5A027}
[Y¤u]
I'm glad that you came.

[Kid]
Huh?


18 :

{Y5A028}
[Y¤u]
"That you made your way through the labyrinth 
to find me."

[Kid]
.........


{Y5A029}
[Y¤u]
"Now all you have to do is rescue the 
princess. Right, prince?"

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
You just don't quit...

[Kid]
"Alright then, I guess I'm off to dispose of 
some evil dragon."

Finally, I understood.

The evil dragon that was holding Y¤u...

...It was Y¤u's past.

And she needed to be saved.


19 :

{Y4A483}
[Sara]
"Listen... No matter how much a girl pretends 
to be strong, she's always waiting."


20 :
I thought maybe she was waiting for me.


21 :

{Y5A030}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, now let's restart our detective 
work!"

Suddenly, I noticed a tart, refreshing aroma
tickling my nose. It mixed with the mildewy
smell of the ruins.

It was the scent of not yet ripened fruit.

It was familiar... It smelled like the sun
in spring.


22 :
We decided to reorganize the information
we had.

We thought about the data we had on
her parents.

Sora's files had reported Y¤u's mother, Tanaka
Yukie, as dying fifteen years ago.

The company LAN had a chat log that indicated
Y¤u's father, Tanaka Yoichi, dying 34 years ago.

However, Y¤u's mom had told her that her
father had gone missing seventeen years ago.

There were pictures and movies, but they
could not be completely trusted as reliable.
Y¤u had even said so herself.

And what was most suspicious...

...Was the lady who Y¤u had always thought
of as her mom.

From what we could gather, the death of her
parents Yoichi and Yukie were facts.

That meant that her mother - or the lady who
called herself that - could have been lying
all along.

...Based on all of the information, we
narrowed it down to the two most likely
possibilities.

'4. Yoichi had died 34 years ago and Yukie
15 years ago.'

[Kid]
Hey, I bet this is what happened.

[Kid]
"If it is true that your mom and dad died, then
the person working at LeMU..."

[Kid]
"I mean the person that you thought was your 
mom up until now isn't your mom, but..."


{Y5A031}
[Y¤u]
A foster parent?

[Kid]
Yeah.

[Kid]
"Then your real dad could have died 34 years 
ago and your mom 15 years ago."

[Kid]
"So somebody that took pity on the orphaned 
daughter took you in and raised you..."


23 :

{Y5A032}
[Y¤u]
But... that's impossible.

[Kid]
Why?


{Y5A033}
[Y¤u]
Because Tanaka Yoichi isn't my real father.


{Y5A034}
[Y¤u]
I mean, it has to be true.


{Y5A035}
[Y¤u]
He died 34 years ago, right?


{Y5A036}
[Y¤u]
And I was born eighteen years ago.


{Y5A037}
[Y¤u]
"To be precise, I was born on September 22nd, 
nineteen years ago."


{Y5A038}
[Y¤u]
"In either case, my father would have had to 
have been alive until December of 
20 years ago."

I figured that was an area I didn't really
know much about, so I held my tongue...

But she was right. It did sound fishy.

The question was how to fill in the
missing years...

[Kid]
No way...


24 :

{Y5A039}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
Uh... Nothing.


25 :

{Y5A040}
[Y¤u]
"What? Tell me. You can't start to say 
something and stop like that."

[Kid]
I don't think this could ever happen, but...

[Kid]
What if you were actually 33 years old...


26 :

{Y5A041}
[Y¤u]
Kyaaahaha! Me? 33?


{Y5A042}
[Y¤u]
"You think that with my skin I look like I could be 
in my 30s?"

27 :
{11:0-22}
{11:1}You look it

{11:1}You don't look it


28 :
[Kid]
You look it.

29 :

{Y5A043}
[Y¤u]
Whaaaaat?


30 :
[Kid]
You don't look it.


31 :

{Y5A044}
[Y¤u]
Right?


{Y5A045}
[Y¤u]
Now, jokes aside...


32 :

{Y5A046}
[Y¤u]
"If I were 33 years old, that would mean 
there was a 15-year gap in my memory."


{Y5A047}
[Y¤u]
"Where in the world could those fifteen years 
have gone?"


{Y5A048}
[Y¤u]
"I've never had amnesia like you, don't 
remember being abducted by aliens, and haven't 
had any Rip Van Winkle-like experiences 
either."

[Kid]
.........

(Rip Van what...?)


{Y5A049}
[Y¤u]
"That would mean when I was 12, I was 
really 27?"


{Y5A050}
[Y¤u]
That couldn't be, right?


{Y5A051}
[Y¤u]
"Or that when I was 5, I was actually 20. 
That's even more impossible."


{Y5A052}
[Y¤u]
"In the eighteen years and seven months of my 
life, I've never once felt a gap of fifteen years."

(A fifteen-year gap...?)

[Kid]
"Listen. Sorry to stop you, but let's get 
back on topic..."


{Y5A053}
[Y¤u]
?

[Kid]
"You were just talking about Rip Van Winkle, 
right?"


{Y5A054}
[Y¤u]
And?

[Kid]
He falls asleep and...


{Y5A055}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

(Rip Van Winkle... He falls asleep... and when
he returns home...)

(When he returns home...)

[Kid]
I got it! I got it!

[Kid]
This is probably what happened.


33 :

{Y5A056}
[Y¤u]
You probably traveled through time!


{Y5A057}
[Y¤u]
"...Would you stop talking about these stupid 
theories of yours?"

[Kid]
But it would explain everything!

[Kid]
"Somewhere along the line, maybe when you were 
small, before you can even remember, I'll bet 
you jumped fifteen years into the future."

[Kid]
You were probably really born 33 years ago...

[Kid]
"That would mean that if Yoichi died 34 years 
ago, it all makes sense."


{Y5A058}
[Y¤u]
"Geez... How many times are you going to have 
to say that before you are satisfied?"


{Y5A059}
[Y¤u]
Time travel is a physical impossibility.


{Y5A060}
[Y¤u]
Just like...

[Kid]
...Water flows downhill...

[Kid]
"BUT, if you use a siphon, you can move water 
uphill!"


{Y5A061}
[Y¤u]
That's not what I mean.


{Y5A062}
[Y¤u]
It's just an example, an analogy...

[Kid]
But... But...

[Kid]
"But you're not the only one that experienced 
time travel!"

[Kid]
I... I did too...

[Kid]
But my time travel was different...

[Kid]
"And I think it's probably the reason that 
I get premonitions about things."

[Kid]
I was trapped here in LeMU before.


{Y5A063}
[Y¤u]
How can you be so sure about it?


{Y5A064}
[Y¤u]
"How can you be so absolutely confident about 
it?"


{Y5A065}
[Y¤u]
Even if... IF...


{Y5A066}
[Y¤u]
"Just suppose that you did travel through 
time..."


{Y5A067}
[Y¤u]
Where is the other Kid, the other you?

[Kid]
The other me?


34 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}


{16:0}‡L'Life readings: 7'{16:1}

{16:4}

35 :
I remembered on the night of May 1st, when the
numbers for the life scan kept changing.


{Y5A068}
[Y¤u]
Yes, the other you.


{Y5A069}
[Y¤u]
"You're saying that you've been repeating 
the several days of being trapped here, right?"


{Y5A070}
[Y¤u]
"If so, then the past you should be here as 
well."

[Kid]
That's... Uh... I...

[Kid]
"I know! Only my memory is going back 
through time!"


{Y5A071}
[Y¤u]
Even though you forgot everything?

[Kid]
That's exactly why I've lost my memory!

[Kid]
"Normally, anything like a memory going back 
through time would defy common sense."

[Kid]
But this time, common sense is being defied...

[Kid]
"My brain couldn't deal with the situation and 
started to panic. So it tried to logically 
explain or deal with the situation."

[Kid]
And so it erased all of my memories.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........


{Y5A072}
[Y¤u]
"Uh... I don't mean to take the air out of you 
after your enthusiastic speech, but..."


{Y5A073}
[Y¤u]
We don't call that logical.


{Y5A074}
[Y¤u]
"I'm pretty sure the word is pathological. And 
sometimes they add the word delusional for 
good measure."


36 :
.........

......

...

So the day ended without us finding any
answers.


37 :
The next morning.

Everybody slept in.

It looked like everyone was pretty beat.

When Y¤u and I saw each other, we both said
'good morning' as if everything were normal.

It seemed like she wanted to act as if things
were the same as always in front of everybody
else.

So I did my best to follow suit.

{16:4}

38 :
The late start pushed our breakfast time back
later than usual.

Sora had put in a request, so we were going to
have another picnic.

She really seemed to enjoy them.

We spread out the same Myumyun blanket near
the rest area.


39 :
I went to go check on the trap that we had set
the night before while everyone was
preparing, just in case we'd caught something.

But just as I got to where we'd set it, I saw
Takeshi breaking down the trap.


40 :
[Kid]
Huh? You're cleaning it up?

Takeshi nodded silently.

[Kid]
Meaning... that...?

[Takeshi]
.........

Takeshi's shoulders slumped, and he let out
a big sigh.

He looked so pathetic... I couldn't say
anything else.


41 :
When we had finally gotten everything ready,
Tsugumi appeared out of nowhere.

She once again plopped herself down on the
sheet and started munching away.

I didn't know if Takeshi had matured over
night, but he held his tongue, though it was
clear he was in a sulky mood.

Sara and Tsugumi didn't look at each other. It
seemed like they were ignoring each other.

Apparently, they still weren't getting along.

But everybody tried to make the best of it,
eating, chatting, and having fun.


42 :

{Y5A075}
[Sara]
Ready, Ro Sham Bo!


{Y5A076}
[Sara]
Ready, go!

[Kid]
I lost again!


{Y5A077}
[Y¤u]
"Kid, you're terrible at this. What is that? 
Sixteen losses in a row?"

[Kid]
Weird...


{Y5A078}
[Y¤u]
"You're too nice. You have to just throw out 
what you feel: rock, paper, or scissors."


{Y5A079}
[Sara]
He's the gullible type.

[Kid]
I am not. I'm trying to win.


{Y5A080}
[Y¤u]
Ready, go!

[Kid]
Dang it!

I just kept losing.


{Y5A081}
[Y¤u]
"Could be that, with your amnesia, your 
ability to make decisions isn't so good 
right now."


{Y5A082}
[Y¤u]
"Don't get too caught up with the trivial 
things that you can't control."


{Y5A083}
[Y¤u]
"You need to be strong. Make up your own mind. 
Or you'll just end up following everybody else."

[Kid]
I know...


{Y5A084}
[Y¤u]
That being as it is...


43 :

{Y5A085}
[Sara]
Time for the LOSER'S PENALTY!


{Y5A086}
[Y¤u]
Hand over your sandwich.

[Kid]
...

Silently, I held out my sandwich.


{Y5A087}
[Sara]
Alrighty~


44 :
She squeezed a ton of mustard onto
my sandwich.

The penalty was mustard. And my sandwich was
already drenched in the stuff.

My mouth felt like it was on fire before I
even took a bite.

...Maybe thanks to that silly exchange, I was
able to get through the whole thing without
thinking about it too much.

Suddenly, someone cut across my field of
vision.

It was Tsugumi.

Tsugumi was walking toward Takeshi. She
extended her hand.


45 :

{Y5A088}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What's with the hand?

[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A089}
[Takeshi]
You're like a dog. Shake, girl.


{Y5A090}
[Takeshi]
"And you'll probably say 'Don't make fun 
of me!'"


46 :

{Y5A091}
[Tsugumi]
You're really dumb, you know that?


{Y5A092}
[Sora]
"Are you trying to say that you want another 
helping?"


47 :
Tsugumi nodded at Sora's extra explanation.

She had already wolfed down her first one.


{Y5A093}
[Takeshi]
"Hey... You've gotta lot of nerve... You only 
show your face at meal time, and now you're 
demanding seconds..."


48 :

{Y5A094}
[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose...


{Y5A095}
[Tsugumi]
So do you have more or not?


{Y5A096}
[Takeshi]
"I do. I thought you might want more, so 
I made a SPECIAL one for you."

[Kid]
Special?

I had a bad feeling about the whole thing.


{Y5A097}
[Takeshi]
Eat this. And no leftovers.

[Tsugumi]
...

Tsugumi took the sandwich without saying
anything.

[Takeshi]
...

Takeshi stared at Tsugumi as she took the wrap
off of the sandwich.


49 :

{Y5A098}
[Tsugumi]
...What?


50 :

{Y5A099}
[Takeshi]
"Nothing. It's just that you're so beautiful. 
I can't take my eyes off of you even when 
you're just removing a sandwich wrapper..."


{Y5A100}
[Tsugumi]
Your stupidity is terminal.


{Y5A101}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe if you died 50 times it would help.

[Takeshi]
...

I thought Takeshi would get angry.

But he was just grinning as he watched Tsugumi
start in on her sandwich.

Something was definitely not right there.
I sucked in my breath and watched.

Tsugumi bit into the sandwich.

Munch.

Chomp. Chew.


51 :

{Y5A102}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm?


52 :

{Y5A103}
[Takeshi]
Heeheee~


{Y5A104}
[Takeshi]
Fwaaahahahahaha~

[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A105}
[Takeshi]
"It's got quite a flavor, huh? That 
sandwich... Hahaha..."

Takeshi laughed so hard he cried.


{Y5A106}
[Takeshi]
"It's packed with mustard, Tabasco, pepper, 
sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, mint, and a dose of 
curry powder..."


{Y5A107}
[Takeshi]
"For good measure, I added a dose of 
mayonnaise, ketchup, sugar, salt, soy sauce, 
vinegar, and vanilla..."


{Y5A108}
[Takeshi]
And... what else? Oh, I forget...


{Y5A109}
[Takeshi]
"Anyway, I threw in every ingredient and spice 
that I could find. It's my secret 34-ingredient 
sauce."

[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A110}
[Y¤u]
H-hey! That's just too cruel!


{Y5A111}
[Sara]
Yeah...!

[Kid]
That's going too far, Takeshi!


53 :

{Y5A112}
[Takeshi]
Shut up! I'm the cook here.


{Y5A113}
[Sora]
"Ko-Komachi-san... I highly recommend inducing 
vomiting immediately...!"


{Y5A114}
[Sora]
"Get water quickly! N-no... We'll need 
medicine first...!"


54 :

{Y5A115}
[Takeshi]
"She'll be fine. She'll get the runs, 
but she won't die."

[Kid]
That's not something you should do to a girl.

I went to grab Takeshi with my left hand.


55 :

{Y5A116}
[Tsugumi]
Wait. I'm fine.

Tsugumi mumbled that, stopping us.


56 :

{Y5A117}
[Takeshi]
Huh, well aren't you tough!


{Y5A118}
[Tsugumi]
I'm perfectly fine.


57 :

{Y5A119}
[Takeshi]
"But it still tastes terrible, right? Right? 
Tell the truth."


58 :

{Y5A120}
[Tsugumi]
I'm totally fine...


59 :

{Y5A121}
[Tsugumi]
It tastes kind of like pizza.


60 :
[Kid]
......

[Takeshi]
......

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
............

[Sora]
...............


61 :
What?


62 :

{Y5A122}
[Takeshi]
What did you just say? What's it taste like?


{Y5A123}
[Tsugumi]
Pizza.


{Y5A124}
[Takeshi]
Are you serious?

Tsugumi nodded.

[Takeshi]
.........


{Y5A125}
[Tsugumi]
*Munch*, *munch*...


63 :

{Y5A126}
[Takeshi]
Hey... Let me see that! That can't be!


64 :
Takeshi went to grab the sandwich, but Tsugumi
was too quick for him. Not only that, Takeshi
caught his foot and fell to the floor.

In that instant, Tsugumi polished off the
sandwich.


{Y5A127}
[Tsugumi]
Thanks for the sandwich.


{Y5A128}
[Tsugumi]
You made it specially for me, right?

[Takeshi]
..................

So the event ended with Tsugumi turning the
tables on Takeshi.


65 :
I ended up cleaning the area afterward.

I separated the cans and sandwich wrappers
and put them in garbage bags.

Y¤u and Sara helped.

Takeshi said he was going to start getting
ready for lunch and headed to the kiosk.

Sora said she had to do some maintenance
on LeMMIH and left for the control room.

Tsugumi disappeared to somewhere unknown.

...

But something happened when I was picking up
garbage.


66 :

{T5B003}
[???]
Yahoo~

[Kid]
Huh?


67 :

{Y5A129}
[Y¤u]
What? What's the matter?

[Kid]
Nothing...

[Kid]
Did somebody just call out?


{Y5A130}
[Y¤u]
What?


{Y5A131}
[Sara]
Nobody said anything.

[Kid]
Really? Must be my imagination...


68 :

{Y5A132}
[Sara]
"I'll bet you're just trying to find a way to 
get out of helping."

[Kid]
I'm not. It's not that at all.


69 :

{Y5A133}
[Y¤u]
You hearing your mystery voices again?

[Kid]
Well, I...


{Y5A134}
[Y¤u]
"Please don't do that again. Get a hold of 
yourself already."


{Y5A135}
[Y¤u]
I know you're tired, but...

[Kid]
.........


70 :
We started picking up garbage again.

We finally finished with the trash, folded the
blanket, and were done cleaning up.


71 :

{Y5A136}
[Y¤u]
Now we'll just sweep the area.


{Y5A137}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo. Can you do me a favor and get me a 
broom and dustpan? I think they're at the 
kiosk."


{Y5A138}
[Sara]
Roger that!


72 :
Sara set out for the kiosk.

[Kid]
"I was just thinking. This must be a nightmare 
for the people that clean this place."


73 :

{Y5A139}
[Y¤u]
It would be if 'people' had to do it.


{Y5A140}
[Y¤u]
"But LeMMIH usually uses a cleaning robot that 
automatically cleans the whole complex."

[Kid]
Wow.


{Y5A141}
[Y¤u]
"Well, what with the accident and all, I 
imagine the robot is a rusted pile of junk 
metal at the bottom of the ocean right 
about now."

[Kid]
I'll bet.


{T5B017}
[???]
Here we go...

(...What?)

I... I was hearing voices again.


{Y5A142}
[Y¤u]
"Thinking about it, I guess that LeMU is just 
one massive pile of scrap metal."


{Y5A143}
[Y¤u]
"I suppose it's just a matter of how it's 
destroyed..."


74 :

{Y5A144}
[Y¤u]
What? What's the matter?

[Kid]
Um...


{Y5A145}
[Y¤u]
You're not... Not again?


75 :
[Kid]
...


76 :

{Y5A146}
[Y¤u]
"Oh... Alright. You've done enough. Just go to 
the infirmary or somewhere and rest."


{Y5A147}
[Y¤u]
"You've got a serious condition or 
something..."

I was sure I'd heard something...

That time, I was sure it wasn't my imagination.


{T5B019}
[???]
I'm carving.


{T5B020}
[???]
Can't you see? I'm carving...

(See, I really can hear something.)


{T5B021}
[???]
I'm etching some marks into this stone statue.

(...Stone statue?)


77 :
I looked around the four stone statues at the
edge of the open area.

And there....


78 :
Atop the pedestal of a stone statue was a girl.

She was standing next to the figure as
if clinging to it.

(Oh! It's that girl...)

It was the girl who I had seen and who had
then vanished on the first day.

[Kid]
Look, Y¤u! Right there!


79 :

{Y5A148}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
Look! Over on that statue!


{Y5A149}
[Y¤u]
What about the statue?

[Kid]
"Look! That stone statue! There's a girl 
there! See?"


80 :

{Y5A150}
[Y¤u]
Huh? I don't see anybody.

[Kid]
Not there! Over there!

[Kid]
Oh, forget it! I'll go call to her!


{Y5A151}
[Y¤u]
Kid!


81 :
I sprinted toward the stone statue.

(What could that girl be doing up there?)


{T5B023}
[???]
Well, it's because...


{T5B024}
[???]
I was feeling lonesome.

Lonesome?


{T5B025}
[???]
And anyway, I was...


{T5B026}
[???]
...Feeling sad...

Sad?

(What is she talking about?)


{T5B043}
[???]
Here we go, next...


{T5B044}
[???]
Uh-oh!

Just then, the girl lost her balance, falling
from her awkward place on the pedestal.


82 :
[Kid]
L-look out!

I ran toward her.

The water caught on my feet and sprayed
everywhere as I ran all out to where she was.

(Will I make it?)


83 :
I closed my eyes, mustered all of my power,
and sprinted.

I threw out my free left hand to where the
girl would be falling to catch her.


84 :
‡LSplash!

....

....

....

I didn't feel anything.

I thought maybe I hadn't reached her in time.

Scared, I opened my eyes.


85 :
(...What?)

There was no one in my arms.

Or even nearby.

Only the water sloshing about gently around me.


{Y5A152}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, are you alright? It looks like you took 
a pretty nasty spill..."

[Kid]
...


86 :
I looked above me.

Of course, there was no one on the pedestal
supporting the statue.

Without saying anything, I got up and went
behind the statue.


87 :
There were scratches in the stone.

They looked like they had been deeply carved
there by something hard and sharp.


They were in the shape of people.

Really simple-looking, like stick people.

At the end of each stick was a little round
face...

There were six in all.

Looking closer, I saw that next to the people
figures were two carvings of animals that I'd
never seen.


88 :
I looked up at the statue.

The statue was pointing diagonally upward...
to the east.


89 :

{Y5A153}
[Sara]
Hey, what are you two doing?


{Y5A154}
[Y¤u]
That's a good question...

I ignored them and gently touched the carvings
on the statue.

Without thinking, I blurted out...

[Kid]
Watch your step, okay?


{T5B048}
[???]
Okay~

The answer could have been my imagination
that time...


90 :
After that, I decided to go to the infirmary
and sleep.

It wasn't that I was feeling ill.

It was simply that I wasn't getting enough
sleep. I wanted some quality rest.

I slept so deeply that I didn't even dream...

{16:4}

91 :
When I awoke, it was already around evening.


There was a memo by the bed.

{16:4}

92 :
'We will be in the conference room until
dinner.'

'If you wake up by then, please come along.'

'I'm sorry for making you hang out with me
the last couple days.'

'Please make sure that you get enough rest.'

'‡LY¤u'


93 :
{1}

Judging from the signature, it seemed that
Y¤u had left it.

{16:4}

94 :
I got out of bed, stretched, and left the room.


95 :
I started walking in the direction opposite
of the conference room.

I decided to take a walk around the complex
for fun.


96 :
I got into Ei.

I thought that it might make for a good
change of pace to walk around a floor
I hadn't spent much time on.

...That was my thinking.


97 :
I rode down to the third floor that was
flooded with water.

I wondered where I should go...

I looked around, thinking.


98 :
...It was then that it happened.

I saw 'her' again!

[Kid]
Hey!

I saw her small figure cutting across the
corridor.

I was sure of it.

It was that girl!

I chased after her.


99 :
Her skirt shook back and forth as she walked
farther and farther away.

It was almost as if she was trying to get
away from me.

[Kid]
Hey! Wait a minute!

She might not have heard me, because she didn't
show any sign of stopping.

I wondered what it was all about.

The girl that kept appearing out of nowhere
and then disappearing.

The girl that didn't register on LeMMIH's
bio scan.

No, she had registered once...


100 :
‡L'Life readings: 7'


101 :
But the more I thought about it, the stranger
everything seemed.

She only appeared in front of me, and we hardly
communicated...

Well, I couldn't worry about it. I knew it
wouldn't help.

It was something that I could solve by asking
her directly.


102 :
She headed into the Cosmic Whale room.

I followed in soon after her.


103 :
The room was dimly lit.

A massive whale floated like a majestic
phantasm in the cosmic room.

The girl was in the middle of the room.


104 :
She was facing away from me, sitting and
hugging her knees.

[Kid]
I finally... caught up...

I approached her as I caught my breath.

...I heard singing.

It sounded like phrases from a children's song.


{Y5A155}
[???]
Moon sprite... shouldering... a long bow...


{Y5A156}
[???]
Waiting... inside a dream...

I felt like...

I had heard the lyrics somewhere before.


105 :
And recently...


106 :
Somewhere, I was sure...

In the distant, distant past...


107 :
I wondered if it was my missing memory that
was making me feel that way...?

[Kid]
Hey, you.

Her shoulders jumped with shock, and she
stopped singing.


108 :
Slowly, she turned back to look at me.

It was the girl after all.

[Kid]
Why do you run away from me?

[???]
.........

[Kid]
Oh well. I guess it doesn't matter.

It really did matter to me, but since I had
finally been able to confront the girl,
I felt a surge of relief.

[Kid]
Well, why don't we go where everyone else is?

I held out my hand as I said that.

Finally, she stood up and spoke.


109 :

{Y5A158}
[???]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
...What?

[???]
.........

The girl just stared at my face.

[Kid]
L-let's go!


110 :
I took her hand and tugged it as I began
to walk.

The inside of my mind was churning...


It was because of what she had just said.

Inside of me, it felt like another 'me' was
screaming.

...That was how I felt.


111 :
[Kid]
I found another girl!


112 :
I burst into the conference room as
I shouted that.

Of course, I was still leading the girl
by the hand.

Everyone turned to look at me at once.


113 :

{Y5A159}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?


{Y5A160}
[Y¤u]
Another what?


114 :

{Y5A161}
[Takeshi]
Who are you talking about?


{Y5A162}
[Sora]
Are you talking about... THAT girl?

[Kid]
"Yeah. I found her in the Cosmic Whale room 
and brought her here."


115 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


116 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
Wh-what's the matter with everyone?

[Kid]
Why aren't you surprised?


117 :

{Y5A163}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe you'd better rest for a while.

[Kid]
What?


{Y5A164}
[???]
Hey, hey!


118 :
The girl was tugging at my sleeve.

I turned to look at her.

But...

The girl that I had brought back was...


119 :

{Y5A165}
[Sara]
"What are you doing... dragging me here all 
of a sudden?"

[Kid]
S-Sara...?


{Y5A166}
[Sara]
?

I looked back at everyone.


120 :
[Kid]
Th-this isn't right! I swear, I saw her!

[Kid]
"We were walking here hand in hand. It wasn't 
Sara..."


121 :

{Y5A167}
[Sora]
Is that right? Matsunaga-san?


{Y5A168}
[Sara]
No. I didn't see anybody else.


{Y5A169}
[Sara]
The Kid just suddenly grabbed my hand...

[Kid]
What?

[Kid]
Sara... Why are you lying...?


122 :

{Y5A170}
[Sara]
"Huh? What're you talking about? You're 
the one who's lying."

[Kid]
Wh-what...?

[Kid]
"The girl was in the Cosmic Whale room... She 
was sitting down, hugging her knees."

[Kid]
"She was singing some kind of phrases to 
a kid's song."


{Y5A171}
[Sara]
I'm telling you that was me!

Sara was red-faced and shouting.


{Y5A172}
[Sara]
You don't have to tell everybody about it!

[Kid]
.........


123 :
(Geez, what's with her...?)

(What's going on here...?)


124 :

{Y5A173}
[Y¤u]
Aaah!

Y¤u groaned as she slapped her forehead
with her hand.


{Y5A174}
[Y¤u]
"Kid? Just forget about everything else and 
get some rest."


{Y5A175}
[Y¤u]
I'll bring you some dinner later.

[Kid]
...............


125 :

{Y5A176}
[Y¤u]
What is going on with this guy...?


126 :
I thought about a lot of things as I plodded
to the infirmary.


127 :
Things leading to that point.

Things to come.

The odd things going on.

Things I couldn't figure out.

Things I needed to find out.

Things I needed to decide.

{16:4}

128 :
Everything I had been trying to avoid thinking
about all rushed into my mind at once, making
it a confused mess.

I couldn't help thinking... and
worrying... about things.

{16:4}

129 :
‡LAbout Y¤u.

What if the man who had died 34 years ago
wasn't Y¤u's father?

Then who was her real father?

Was the woman that died fifteen years ago
really Y¤u's mother?

If not, then who was?

{16:4}

130 :
‡LAbout me.

Why did I keep having premonitions of
the future? What did it mean?

Who was the girl? Why had I mistaken
Sara for her?

Why had I even lost my memory in the
first place?

What had happened to me in my past?

What did Tsugumi know about all of it?

{16:4}

131 :
And...

Why were we all trapped in LeMU?


Was it just an accident?

Or something else...

{16:4}

132 :
A few hours later, the installation started to
flood again.


133 :
'Dritter Stock‡Lfrom the partition to the
Cosmic Whale was submerged.'

'Casualties: None'

'Flooding to other rooms: None'

'Chance of damage spreading: None'

Sora's voice conveyed the situation over the
intercom in a matter-of-fact tone.

The Cosmic Whale room...

I had been there until just shortly before the
flooding.

But somehow, it felt like some event that
had taken place far, far away.

I covered my head with the blanket,
closed my eyes, and tried to sleep.

I tried to search.

...For the world I should be in.

...For the place I should return to.

...And for myself.
