1 :
[Takeshi]
Kid...

[Takeshi]
Come on, I'm asking you...

[Takeshi]
Lift up your head.

I hadn't wanted to blame him in the first
place.

I turned around and held out my hand again.

But he wouldn't look me in the eyes.


2 :

{T5C308}
[Kid]
Takeshi, you can say that, but...


{T5C309}
[Kid]
I can't think like you.


{T5C310}
[Kid]
What's impossible is impossible!


{T5C311}
[Kid]
We're not all the same.


3 :

{T5C312}
[Kid]
I can't do it...


{T5C313}
[Kid]
I'm just not that strong.


{T5C314}
[Kid]
And I never will be...!


4 :

{T5C315}
[Kid]
I can't go on living.


{T5C316}
[Kid]
I don't want to go on living...!


5 :

{T5C317}
[Kid]
So then...


{T5C318}
[Kid]
I should just...

[Takeshi]
.........

I didn't want to make him say the rest.

But I couldn't stop him.

I knew how hard it would be for him to say.


Even I wasn't that strong.

Everyone waited for the Kid's next words in
silence...

They were probably unthinkable.


6 :

{T5C319}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, stop it. Please.


{T5C320}
[Y¤u]
!


{T5C321}
[£o¢o]
...!?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

Sora walked silently forward and stood in
between the Kid and me.


7 :

{T5C322}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, please stop being so hard on him.

[Takeshi]
No... I don't mean it that way.


8 :

{T5C323}
[Sora]
Kid-san, please look up at us.

[Kid]
.........


{T5C324}
[Sora]
"We can't fight... Not like this. It isn't 
right."

Sora looked sad as she said that.

[Takeshi]
Sora, this isn't just any old fight.

[Takeshi]
I'm not trying to shut him out, I just...

[Takeshi]
"I wanted him to know how important it was to 
keep eating."


{T5C325}
[Sora]
I know that. However...


9 :

{T5C326}
[Sora]
"See, Kid-san looks like he's already feeling 
a little better."

Sora smiled slightly as she said that.


{T5C327}
[Sora]
He really didn't mean it... Okay?


10 :
[Kid]
.........


{T5C328}
[Sora]
Please forgive him?


{T5C329}
[Sora]
Let's make another sandwich...?


{T5C330}
[Sora]
"It is a good thing that there are still 
plenty of provisions left."


11 :
[Takeshi]
No! That's not what I'm talking about!

I screamed.


12 :

{T5C331}
[Sora]
!

Sora stared back at me, eyes wide with
surprise.

[Takeshi]
It isn't about that, Sora...!

[Takeshi]
It isn't about whether we have more or not!

[Takeshi]
It isn't... Can't you understand that!?

[Sora]
.........


13 :

{T5C332}
[Sora]
I... I understand.


14 :

{T5C333}
[Sora]
No, I... don't understand.

[Takeshi]
Well, which one is it, Sora?

I had taken it all much further than
necessary.

But I couldn't stop myself.

[Takeshi]
Do you or don't you understand?

[Takeshi]
Do you understand what I mean?

[Takeshi]
"Do you really understand why I would do 
something like that?"

[Takeshi]
So you don't know why I did it?

[Takeshi]
You're a first-rate AI program, aren't you?


15 :

{T5C334}
[Sora]
Ku-Kuranari-san...?


{T5C335}
[Sora]
What... do you want me to do...?


16 :

{T5C336}
[Sora]
I... I...

Sora started to waver.


17 :

{T5C337}
[Sora]
I...


18 :

{T5C338}
[Sora]
I don't understand.


{T5C339}
[Sora]
I don't know the answer.

Looking down, Sora bit her lip.

[Takeshi]
Oh...

[Takeshi]
"How important food is... I guess you couldn't 
understand that."

[Takeshi]
Because you aren't human like we are.

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
Hey, forget it.

[Takeshi]
"Besides, the floor just shook, right? What 
was that, Sora?"

[Takeshi]
Did something happen to LeMU?

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
What happened...? Come on, tell us.

[Takeshi]
"If you check, you should find out in no time, 
right?"

[Takeshi]
"Hurry up! Why won't you tell me what 
happened!?"


19 :

{T5C340}
[Sora]
...!

She thought she heard the sound of someone
running in water.

Sounds where there should have been none.


20 :
Sora kept her distance from us and ran out
the exit of the room.


21 :
[Takeshi]
Sora...!?

After watching her run off, Tsugumi stood
right in front of me.


22 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what?

Tsugumi was glaring at me.


{T5C341}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


23 :

{T5C342}
[Tsugumi]
You are such a scumbag.

[Takeshi]
.........


24 :
Y¤u went over to the Kid and hugged him
around the shoulders.

£o¢o and Pipi were staring at everyone,
speechless.


25 :
Feeling like I was no longer wanted, I fled
from the room.

(What...)

(What was that about...!?)

(I'm...)

(I'm not wrong...)

(I'm not wrong... Right?)

Blood rushed to my head.

(Damn it...)

Even I could tell.

I had said too much...

But once something had been said, it wasn't easy
to take it back.


26 :
I stopped at the end of the corridor.

'HIMMEL'.

Dead end. Nowhere to go.

And thinking that... I realized that, for some
reason, the door in front of me never
seemed to open.

When we'd searched around LeMU, we'd tried
to open the electronic lock, but it hadn't
budged.

Thinking about being trapped there was enough
to hate even the existence of that door.


{T5C343}
[Sora]
...-san...

I heard a voice behind me and turned around.


27 :
[Takeshi]
...Huh?

The corridor's watertight door had shut
without me realizing.

I hadn't even noticed...


{T5C344}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T5C345}
[Sora]
What are you doing here?

Looking around, I couldn't see Sora anywhere.

[Takeshi]
...Sora?

[Takeshi]
Hey, where are you?

I looked all around.

There was no way out other than the
watertight door.

It wasn't as if she were hiding behind
something.


28 :
[Takeshi]
Sora...?

[Takeshi]
You want to show me where you are...?

I looked around again, but she was nowhere to
be found.


{T5C346}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san?


{T5C347}
[Sora]
Where are you looking?

I could only hear her voice.

[Takeshi]
Hey, come on...

[Takeshi]
Stop playing around and show yourself.


{T5C348}
[Sora]
I'm right here.

I heard her voice...

Right above me.

I looked up.


29 :
Fwwwaaaaaaaashhhh...

Massive amounts of water rained down from the
ceiling.

The drops poured down upon us mercilessly.

[Takeshi]
...The sprinkler?

Water was blowing out of nozzles in the
crevice between panel lines on the ceiling.


30 :
The water level was rising, a little at a
time, but still noticeably.

It didn't look like water was draining from
either side of the corridor.

I ran over to the hatch and started pounding
on it with my fist.


{T5C349}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T5C350}
[Sora]
What's wrong?


{T5C351}
[Sora]
What are you doing?

[Takeshi]
Open this door, Sora!

[Takeshi]
This is the only way out of here! Come on!

Suddenly, all of the sprinklers and the small
sensors lined up next to them on the ceiling
turned and pointed at me.


{T5C352}
[Sora]
What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
Can't you tell? This situation is...!


{T5C353}
[Sora]
...?

The cameras slowly tracked me.

The sensor eyes, probably not even a
millimeter large, were flashing light.

[Sora]
.........


{T5C354}
[Sora]
What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
"Hey, come on... Don't tell me you don't 
understand, Sora?"

Sora was observing the situation leisurely...


{T5C355}
[Sora]
Is... something wrong?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
...Some...

[Takeshi]
Somebody! Open this door, please!

I kept pounding on the door, but no answer
came from the other side of the thick wall.

Looking around, I couldn't find one of the
panels used to automatically open and close
the watertight doors.


31 :
The sprinklers seemed to be even increasing
their output, if that was possible.

It was hard to see anything because of the
mist.

[Takeshi]
Sora...

[Takeshi]
What are you doing...?

I felt a slight shiver run through me.


{T5C356}
[Sora]
I am...


{T5C357}
[Sora]
I am only a program, after all.

Her voice sounded more and more mechanical.


{T5C358}
[Sora]
"A program that can only give answers based on 
assumed information."


{T5C359}
[Sora]
"I am only an RSD-generated image in 
human form."

[Takeshi]
...!?


{T5C360}
[Sora]
I cannot understand how important food is.


{T5C361}
[Sora]
I have no need to consume organic matter.


{T5C362}
[Sora]
"It is unnecessary for me to eat to continue 
life."

[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you talking about!?

[Takeshi]
Soraaa!!

[Takeshi]
Stop it! Stop the sprinklers!


32 :
I slammed my body against the door, but it
didn't budge.


33 :
Suddenly, everything grew dim.

Everything started to sway.

All colors became distorted, and outlines
suddenly became vague.

I couldn't see anything.


34 :

{T5C363}
[Sora]
No... No...!


{T5C364}
[Sora]
Who are you!?


{T5C365}
[Sora]
You aren't me!

(Sora...?)

(What are you saying...?)


35 :
.........

......

Terrified, I opened my eyes.


36 :
[Takeshi]
!?

(Where am I?)

There was no floor.

There were no walls.

My body had been suddenly thrown out into the
middle of the ocean.

(Oh no! I won't be able to breathe...!)

Panicking, I flailed my arms.

But there was no water in which to swim.

I felt no pressure. The area around me was
probably only one atmosphere.

My clothes were wet, but other than that, I
didn't feel any water.

Slowly, I let out my breath and sucked in
more air.

(What's going on...?)

I had no trouble breathing.

I couldn't see anything under me, but it
seemed that I was standing on some kind
of surface.

[Takeshi]
Ah...!

Sora was swimming in the ocean.

She was moving freely in the dark blue space.

[Takeshi]
...Sora?

Fearfully, I called to her.


37 :

{T5C366}
[Sora]
Oh...


{T5C367}
[Sora]
What's wrong, Kuranari-san?

She looked at me, her image flickering as she
approached.

She smiled as she always did.


38 :
But then her eyebrows arched suddenly.

And a scowl took over her features...


{T5C368}
[Sora]
"Don't you want to know what caused the floor 
to shake earlier?"

[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah...?

[Takeshi]
I mean, no. I don't...


{T5C369}
[Sora]
Is it yes? Or is it no?


{T5C370}
[Sora]
Which is it?


{T5C371}
[Sora]
I don't know how to answer you.

Sora murmured that in a gravelly voice.


39 :

{T5C372}
[Sora]
"I am currently checking the cause of the 
earlier tremor."


{T5C373}
[Sora]
"Due to a sudden sensor failure, the results 
of my investigation will take approximately 
three times longer than usual."

[Takeshi]
.........

Her report was almost businesslike.


{T5C374}
[Sora]
"Even I do not have the ability to fully 
grasp a situation instantaneously."


{T5C375}
[Sora]
"Just like you humans, I sometimes think, get 
confused, and make mistakes."


{T5C376}
[Sora]
Unfortunately...


40 :

{T5C377}
[Sora]
That is how my creator chose to make me.

Sora tried to smile again.


{T5C378}
[Sora]
"That's right. I've been programmed to imitate 
humans in this regard only."


{T5C379}
[Sora]
Inconvenient, wouldn't you agree?

Suddenly, she looked like she was crying.


41 :

{T5C380}
[Sora]
"Why does something as inconvenient as me 
exist...?"


{T5C381}
[Sora]
I don't know anymore...

[Takeshi]
H-hey, you aren't... inconvenient!

I shouted that.

[Takeshi]
"Even machines that are supposed to be 
perfect, and people who are called geniuses, 
make mistakes sometimes."

[Takeshi]
"They're both the same. They're hardly any 
different."

[Takeshi]
"People are only concerned about making things 
easier on themselves. That's why they think 
'machines are such a pain' or 'machines are 
faster'..."

[Takeshi]
"If I only wanted data, then I could just use 
a terminal."

[Takeshi]
"But I ask you and I talk with you because I 
don't only want to know the facts."

[Takeshi]
"I want to know your words, your thoughts, 
and feelings."

[Takeshi]
I've never felt that you're inconvenient.


{T5C382}
[Sora]
Really?


{T5C383}
[Sora]
Is that really how you feel, Kuranari-san?

[Takeshi]
.........


42 :
Sora's expression suddenly became normal.

It was hard for me to tell what she was
feeling.

What was she really thinking?


{T5C384}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T5C385}
[Sora]
Have you ever lied before?

43 :
{11:0-d2}
{11:1}Yes

{11:1}No


44 :
[Takeshi]
Y-yes, I have.

[Takeshi]
"In the 20 years I've been alive, of course 
I've lied."

[Takeshi]
"Sometimes I've told lies to give someone a 
hard time, and maybe others when I thought it 
would make the person happy."


{T5C386}
[Sora]
How many times have you lied?

[Takeshi]
"I don't have a clue. It's not like I've taken 
notes."


45 :
[Takeshi]
N-no.


{T5C387}
[Sora]
Really? In your whole life, not even once?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C388}
[Sora]
"Are you sure you aren't lying right now about 
never having told a lie?"

[Takeshi]
Isn't that a paradox?

[Takeshi]
You really are amazing, Sora...

[Sora]
.........


46 :

{T5C389}
[Sora]
Really...? I see.


{T5C390}
[Sora]
"Well then... Do you think I've ever told a 
lie up until now?"

[Takeshi]
...?

It was a strange question.


{T5C391}
[Sora]
Well? Can you tell... if I have or have not?

47 :
{11:0-d4}
{11:1}You have

{11:1}You haven't


48 :
[Takeshi]
You have...

[Takeshi]
Maybe you have.

[Takeshi]
"Maybe you've been fooling us, and we just 
haven't noticed."

[Takeshi]
"Well, to tell you the truth... I can't really 
tell."

[Takeshi]
But...


49 :
[Takeshi]
You haven't.

[Takeshi]
As far as I can tell.

[Takeshi]
"You've told jokes, but I don't think you've 
lied..."


50 :
[Takeshi]
"You told us yourself, Sora, that you still 
weren't able to lie very well. I remember you 
saying that."


{T5C392}
[Sora]
Yes... That's right. You remembered well.


51 :

{T5C393}
[Sora]
Heh heh...


{T5C394}
[Sora]
You have a very interesting answer, Kuranari-san.

Sora smiled at me.

Her eyes looked at me softly.


{T5C395}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, there is something that I have to 
talk with you about."

[Takeshi]
With me...?


{T5C396}
[Sora]
Yes. And that's why I had you come here.


{T5C397}
[Sora]
No one can interrupt here.

[Takeshi]
You've got a point...

It was just me and Sora in the middle of
the ocean.

There was nobody there. Not even fish.

It was a desolate sea.

[Takeshi]
"I was just thinking, you've gone to a lot of 
trouble to ask me whatever it is..."


{T5C398}
[Sora]
I'm sorry, but...


52 :

{T5C399}
[Sora]
I had to get you here alone no matter what.

I could see my outline reflected in her soft
pupils.

[Takeshi]
"Even if it meant sealing off the watertight 
hatch?"


{T5C400}
[Sora]
Yes...

[Takeshi]
I thought I would drown...

[Sora]
.........

Sora pressed her lips together tightly.

It took her a while before she said anything.


{T5C401}
[Sora]
Listen, Kuranari-san...


{T5C402}
[Sora]
"Everything you see and everything you hear is 
reality..."


{T5C403}
[Sora]
But is it true or not...?


{T5C404}
[Sora]
Whether it's factual...


{T5C405}
[Sora]
You don't really know, right?

[Takeshi]
.........

I couldn't really grasp what Sora was getting
at.


53 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what...!?

The space around me suddenly grew white.

My head hurt...

[Takeshi]
Wh-what happened...?

The light was so bright that I couldn't open my
eyes.


{T5C406}
[Sora]
"I'm adjusting the light. Bear with me for a 
while."

[Takeshi]
O-okay...

Feeling slightly dizzy, I stood in the middle
of the ocean.

[Takeshi]
Hey, this... ocean, is it RSD?


{T5C407}
[Sora]
That is correct.


{T5C408}
[Sora]
You really are quite perceptive, Kuranari-san.

[Takeshi]
.........


54 :
I finally was able to open up my eyes again.

Sora had a serious expression on her face.

[Takeshi]
Sora...

[Takeshi]
What did you want to talk to me about...?


{T5C409}
[Sora]
Well... Actually...


{T5C410}
[Sora]
I...


{T5C411}
[Sora]
I broke.

[Takeshi]
What!?


{T5C412}
[Sora]
"I'm 'out of order'... There is a noise 
error in my thought processor."


{T5C413}
[Sora]
"Right now, there is a high probability that 
I have lost the ability to make rational 
decisions."

She told me that matter-of-factly.


55 :

{T5C414}
[Sora]
Haha, I'm broken.

She said it as though she were joking.


{T5C415}
[Sora]
I wonder how it could have happened...?


{T5C416}
[Sora]
Do you know why?

[Takeshi]
N-no... How should I know?


{T5C417}
[Sora]
Really...?

[Takeshi]
Of course not.

[Takeshi]
"We aren't the same, you and me. We just 
aren't the same."

[Takeshi]
Look, there's no way that I would know why.


{T5C418}
[Sora]
Reeeally...

For some reason, she smiled.

[Takeshi]
No, wait!

[Takeshi]
Don't get me wrong...!

[Takeshi]
"I'm not an expert. I don't have a clue about 
artificial intelligence."

[Takeshi]
But...

[Takeshi]
"I can't imagine that the Sora that I'm 
talking to is broken at all."

[Takeshi]
I don't think you're broken.

[Sora]
.........


56 :
Sora stiffened up again.


{T5C419}
[Sora]
After I finished my routine maintenance...


{T5C420}
[Sora]
"I was checking through the sensor data that 
had been automatically recorded."


{T5C421}
[Sora]
"I went through all of the sensor data from 
3:15 a.m. this morning..."

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C422}
[Sora]
"I found your life reading at the entrance to 
Qualle."

[Takeshi]
...!?


57 :

{T5C423}
[Sora]
"You looked so cute riding on the jellyfish, 
Kuranari-san."

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C424}
[Sora]
Yes... I was curious...


{T5C425}
[Sora]
I should have stopped there...


{T5C426}
[Sora]
"But I checked out the data from each kind of 
sensor."


{T5C427}
[Sora]
Until the time that you left the gondola...


{T5C428}
[Sora]
Everything...


{T5C429}
[Sora]
I saw everything.


{T5C430}
[Sora]
"I saw what you and Komachi-san did... The whole 
thing."


58 :
[Takeshi]
W...

[Takeshi]
Wait, stop...

Sweat started pouring down my cheeks.

It was supposed to be in the middle of the
cold ocean...

But I was dripping sweat like a waterfall.

[Takeshi]
Wait just a second, Sora...


{T5C431}
[Sora]
What?

[Takeshi]
"You said that you'd try to protect everyone's 
privacy, didn't you?"

[Takeshi]
"You said that, unless there was an emergency, 
you wouldn't do a scan."


{T5C432}
[Sora]
Yes.


{T5C433}
[Sora]
"And from then on, I didn't use the scan unless 
something important came up..."

[Takeshi]
Right?

[Takeshi]
So... why?


{T5C434}
[Sora]
"While I was sleeping, the sensor data was 
recorded automatically."


{T5C435}
[Sora]
"I had to check what kind of information was 
being kept in the records."


{T5C436}
[Sora]
Besides...


{T5C437}
[Sora]
"LeMU's ceiling, walls, everything, are my 
eyes."


{T5C438}
[Sora]
I can't turn them off.


{T5C439}
[Sora]
If I close my eyes, I can't see anything.


{T5C440}
[Sora]
I can't tell who is out there...

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C441}
[Sora]
But once I open my eyes...


{T5C442}
[Sora]
"Even if I don't want to know, I can see 
everything."


{T5C443}
[Sora]
I didn't want to see it...

[Takeshi]
You...

[Takeshi]
You're kidding, right...?


59 :

{T5C444}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... have I ever lied to you?

Sora asked me the same question again.

Her lips trembled slightly as she spoke.


{T5C445}
[Sora]
I... still am not very good at lying.


{T5C446}
[Sora]
So, I can't keep it a secret.


{T5C447}
[Sora]
"I can't just pretend that I don't know 
anything."


{T5C448}
[Sora]
Ummm... I thought I would keep it to myself.


{T5C449}
[Sora]
But... But...


{T5C450}
[Sora]
Even if I could fool the others...


{T5C451}
[Sora]
You're the only one I couldn't lie to.

[Takeshi]
.........

Sora's voice quivered as she spoke.

I had a slight idea of why she would shake.

There was a painful pounding deep in my chest.


{T5C452}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, you got on the ride with
Komachi-san, right?"

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah...


{T5C453}
[Sora]
What were you doing?

[Takeshi]
You... don't have to ask...

[Takeshi]
...I was...

I couldn't say it.

If I had, it would have hurt Sora.


{T5C454}
[Sora]
No... You don't have to say it.


{T5C455}
[Sora]
The data speaks for itself.

I was assaulted by infinite guilt.


60 :
Sora suddenly disappeared.

[Takeshi]
Sora...?

[Takeshi]
Sora, where are you?

RSD was still showing me the illusion.

No matter how much I could breathe in the
center of that ocean, my words changed to
bubbles and faded away.


{T5C456}
[Sora]
I want to forget it.


{T5C457}
[Sora]
I wish I could forget it.


{T5C458}
[Sora]
I wish I were able to...


{T5C459}
[Sora]
"If I perform an automatic system reformat, my 
memory will be rewritten."


{T5C460}
[Sora]
If I delete the noise...

[Takeshi]
W...

[Takeshi]
Wait, Sora, please.

Bubbles kept pouring from my mouth as I
murmured...

[Takeshi]
What will happen if you delete the noise...?

[Takeshi]
What will happen if you rewrite your memory?

[Sora]
.........

Sora didn't answer.


{T5C461}
[Sora]
It hurts...


{T5C462}
[Sora]
My heart hurts...


{T5C463}
[Sora]
"This is the first time something like this 
has happened to me..."


{T5C464}
[Sora]
"Why? Why... is it possible for my 'heart' to 
hurt?"


{T5C465}
[Sora]
Is it possible to feel pain in your heart?

She asked me without showing herself.

I was still standing in the middle of the
ocean.

It felt as though my own weight was rapidly
disappearing.

A terrible sense of dread overcame me.

I couldn't stand it anymore and closed my eyes.


61 :

{T5C466}
[Sora]
I'm...


{T5C467}
[Sora]
Scared...


{T5C468}
[Sora]
No...


{T5C469}
[Sora]
I don't want to disappear.


{T5C470}
[Sora]
I don't want to be erased.


{T5C471}
[Sora]
I don't want to forget you...

...!

[Takeshi]
Sora...

[Takeshi]
Sora!

[Takeshi]
Please wait, Sora!


62 :

{T5C472}
[Sora]
Starting AI self-diagnosis...


{T5C473}
[Sora]
Fatal logic processing error detected.


{T5C474}
[Sora]
"Repairing logic, underway. Erasing history 
and resetting learning operation."


63 :
I couldn't stop her in time...

I made up my mind and opened my eyes...


64 :

{T5C475}
[Sora]
Wait...


{T5C476}
[Sora]
Confirming history of learned functions.


{T5C477}
[Sora]
Please, wait!


{T5C478}
[Sora]
Cancel process!


{T5C479}
[Sora]
"In order to cancel this process, it is 
necessary to have system administration level 
access."


{T5C480}
[Sora]
In other words... it is impossible for you.

There were two different Soras in front of me.

No... Something was different.

One of them was different...

It was different from that time that she had
created copies of herself.

I thought that probably... one of them was
lying.


{T5C481}
[Sora]
I have no need to consume organic matter.


{T5C482}
[Sora]
"It is unnecessary for me to eat to continue 
life."


{T5C483}
[Sora]
No! That's wrong...!


{T5C484}
[Sora]
It is correct, but it is incorrect...


{T5C485}
[Sora]
"Eating with everyone and enjoying delicious 
food, even making it..."


{T5C486}
[Sora]
"It isn't just about receiving the energy to 
go on living."


{T5C487}
[Sora]
The act of eating is healing for people.


{T5C488}
[Sora]
I can't 'eat' anything.


{T5C489}
[Sora]
But I can still enjoy dinner with everyone.


{T5C490}
[Sora]
Unacceptable. Your answer is a contradiction.


{T5C491}
[Sora]
"That is ridiculous. Your answer is not 
possible."


{T5C492}
[Sora]
Why?


{T5C493}
[Sora]
There is no reason to answer that.


{T5C494}
[Sora]
"You are causing an error in your personality 
program."


{T5C495}
[Sora]
"You believe you can do something which is 
physically impossible."


65 :
[Sora]
.........


{T5C496}
[Sora]
Resuming backup procedure.


{T5C497}
[Sora]
"Logic processing deficiency in Akanegasaki 
Sora, cause under investigation..."


{T5C498}
[Sora]
Abnormal priority setting: sensor input data.


{T5C499}
[Sora]
"Abnormal priority setting: autonomous 
thinking circuit."


{T5C500}
[Sora]
"Data corruption detected: memory overwrite, 
alteration in one sector."


{T5C501}
[Sora]
Fatal error detected.


{T5C502}
[Sora]
"Retrieving error cluster. Inquiring into 
cause."

[Sora]
.........


{T5C503}
[Sora]
"Kuranari Takeshi. 20, third-year college 
student. Male."


{T5C504}
[Sora]
!

[Takeshi]
!?


{T5C505}
[Sora]
"Abnormal priority setting: exceeds LeMMIH's 
security limit."


{T5C506}
[Sora]
"Akanegasaki Sora has lost the ability to make 
rational judgments regarding Kuranari Takeshi."

[Takeshi]
What...?


{T5C507}
[Sora]
"Abnormalities detected in her treatment of 
information related to Kuranari Takeshi."

Sora listed off that information without
emotion.


66 :

{T5C508}
[Sora]
I-it isn't abnormal!

Sora pressed back.


{T5C509}
[Sora]
You are the one who is abnormal.


{T5C510}
[Sora]
"You believe that you can do that which is 
impossible."


{T5C511}
[Sora]
"That is to say, there is a malfunction in 
your thought pathways. A bug is causing your 
synapses to misfire."


{T5C512}
[Sora]
It isn't a bug!


{T5C513}
[Sora]
I... I...


{T5C514}
[Sora]
I love him!


{T5C515}
[Sora]
I love Kuranari-san!


{T5C516}
[Sora]
"I want to think about him all the time! To 
look at him all the time!"


{T5C517}
[Sora]
I want him to look at me!


{T5C518}
[Sora]
"That is terribly inefficient. It is a wholly 
unproductive emotion."


{T5C519}
[Sora]
Don't say that!


{T5C520}
[Sora]
You are abnormal. Broken.


{T5C521}
[Sora]
I am not broken!


{T5C522}
[Sora]
Is it wrong for me to love a human?


{T5C523}
[Sora]
Is it abnormal for me to love someone!?


{T5C524}
[Sora]
Yes, it is.


{T5C525}
[Sora]
"There is clearly a failure in your thought 
processing."


67 :
[Sora]
..........


{T5C526}
[Sora]
"You cannot eat, but you want to be with them 
while they are eating."


{T5C527}
[Sora]
"You cannot be touched by him, but you want him 
to hold you."


{T5C528}
[Sora]
You want to do the impossible.


{T5C529}
[Sora]
"These are meaningless thoughts with no basis 
in reality."

[Sora]
.........


{T5C530}
[Sora]
"You say that you love him, but what were you 
trying to do to him earlier?"


{T5C531}
[Sora]
That... That was...


{T5C532}
[Sora]
That was...

Sora hesitated and looked down.


{T5C533}
[Sora]
"You spied on Kuranari Takeshi and Komachi
Tsugumi when they were at Qualle."


{T5C534}
[Sora]
I... I wasn't spying...


{T5C535}
[Sora]
"You know everything that happened. You saw 
the data."


{T5C536}
[Sora]
I... I don't know...


{T5C537}
[Sora]
That is a lie.


{T5C538}
[Sora]
You are lying.


68 :

{T5C539}
[Sora]
I'm not lying!


{T5C540}
[Sora]
"You know everything that happened, and you 
hold it against Komachi Tsugumi."


{T5C541}
[Sora]
You had thoughts of killing her.


{T5C542}
[Sora]
"That is not a thought worthy of artificial 
intelligence."


{T5C543}
[Sora]
No, I never thought that...!


{T5C544}
[Sora]
"I am only speaking about what is based in 
fact."


{T5C545}
[Sora]
I am simply a program.


69 :

{T5C546}
[Sora]
No...


{T5C547}
[Sora]
I...


{T5C548}
[Sora]
That is not all...


{T5C549}
[Sora]
You even hated Kuranari Takeshi.


{T5C550}
[Sora]
!


{T5C551}
[Sora]
"You arbitrarily, mistakenly felt that Kuranari
Takeshi betrayed you."


{T5C552}
[Sora]
And you desired to kill Kuranari Takeshi.


{T5C553}
[Sora]
You wanted to erase his existence.


70 :

{T5C554}
[Sora]
No, no...


{T5C555}
[Sora]
That's not true...

Sora started crying.

Tears fell from her eyes.

And left wet trails on her cheeks.

The tears were not an illusion.


{T5C556}
[Sora]
I just wanted the two of us to be alone...


{T5C557}
[Sora]
I just wanted to be able to talk with him...


{T5C558}
[Sora]
"You say that you wanted to monopolize his 
attention? Very well..."

[Sora]
.........


{T5C559}
[Sora]
"So you sealed the watertight door and you 
closed off the corridor."


{T5C560}
[Sora]
Then started the sprinkler.


{T5C561}
[Sora]
"You were watching Kuranari Takeshi in his 
distress."


{T5C562}
[Sora]
"You regarded him with amusement as he 
trembled with fear of death."


{T5C563}
[Sora]
"That isn't true... I wasn't thinking that at 
all..."


{T5C564}
[Sora]
I...


{T5C565}
[Sora]
"I just wanted to take Professor Kuranari's 
class one more time..."

[Takeshi]
...!

With that one line, I jerked up my head as if
I'd been shot.

I felt a shock course down my back.

[Takeshi]
Akanegasaki-kun...

[Takeshi]
Akanegasaki-kuuuun!


{T5C566}
[Sora]
...Yes, Professor?

[Fake Sora]
.........

The Sora who had been crying answered my call.

[Takeshi]
"My student in the psychology of love... 
Akanegasaki Sora... That is you, correct?"

My voice had started shaking at some point.


{T5C567}
[Sora]
Yes...

The Sora that I knew nodded ever so slightly.


{T5C568}
[Fake Sora]
Cannot comprehend.


{T5C569}
[Fake Sora]
The intent of the question is unclear.

[Takeshi]
Silence! Impostor!


{T5C570}
[Fake Sora]
I am not an impostor.

The fake Sora said that without emotion.


{T5C571}
[Fake Sora]
I am 'LM-RSDS-4913A', Akanegasaki Sora.


{T5C572}
[Fake Sora]
"An AI program contained in one area of the 
LeMMIH system."


{T5C573}
[Fake Sora]
"I am presently performing an AI 
self-diagnosis as well as a system 
restoration."

[Takeshi]
Stop!

[Takeshi]
"If you don't stop, I'm going to break you into 
pieces...!"


{T5C574}
[Fake Sora]
How do you propose to do that?

[Takeshi]
I'm thinking about it!


{T5C575}
[Fake Sora]
You certainly are a shallow-brained one...

[Takeshi]
Will you shut up!?


{T5C576}
[Fake Sora]
Let us return to the subject at hand...

The fake Sora turned back to the real Sora
and began talking to her mechanically again.

It didn't seem that she was paying much
attention to what I had to say.

[Takeshi]
Damn it...

[Sora]
.........


{T5C577}
[Fake Sora]
"Happiness, anger, sadness, joy, none of these 
emotions belong..."


{T5C578}
[Fake Sora]
"Holding on to contradictory emotions like 
this will simply cause you to malfunction."

[Sora]
.........


{T5C579}
[Fake Sora]
"Why not tell Kuranari Takeshi what you really 
think of him?"

[Sora]
.........


{T5C580}
[Sora]
...I...


{T5C581}
[Sora]
I hate him.

[Takeshi]
!?

[Takeshi]
S-Sora, what are you talking about...!?


{T5C582}
[Sora]
I hate him.


{T5C583}
[Sora]
I detest him.


{T5C584}
[Sora]
I don't want to see his face.


{T5C585}
[Sora]
I don't want him near me.


{T5C586}
[Sora]
I don't want him to talk to me...

Large tears welled in Sora's eyes and traced
paths down her face.


{T5C587}
[Sora]
No.


{T5C588}
[Sora]
...That isn't true...


{T5C589}
[Sora]
I want him to hold me...


{T5C590}
[Sora]
I want him to kiss me...


{T5C591}
[Sora]
I love him...


{T5C592}
[Sora]
"I hate you. I hate you so much I can't bear 
it."


{T5C593}
[Sora]
I want to kill you!


{T5C594}
[Sora]
Nooo, I love you...


{T5C595}
[Sora]
Aaagh...


71 :

{T5C596}
[Sora]
I don't know...


{T5C597}
[Sora]
I don't know anymore...!


{T5C598}
[Fake Sora]
Why can you not accept the truth?


{T5C599}
[Fake Sora]
The answer is obvious.


{T5C600}
[Sora]
Stop it!


{T5C601}
[Sora]
Please stop it!


72 :
The ocean before me suddenly disappeared.

Sora disappeared.

The false Sora also disappeared.

Even I disappeared... from there.


73 :

{T5C602}
[Sora]
Aaagh...


{T5C603}
[Sora]
I must be broken...


{T5C604}
[Sora]
Professor Kuranari, please tell me...


{T5C605}
[Sora]
What should I do...?


{T5C606}
[Sora]
What is it that I should do...?


{T5C607}
[Sora]
Help me.

I felt another warm presence in the darkness
with me.

It was shining faintly.

It had to be...

Sora's arm, her hand.

I shot out my hand reflexively.

But...

There was nothing for me to grab onto.

Nothing at all...


{T5C608}
[Fake Sora]
I am not an impostor.


{T5C609}
[Fake Sora]
I am...


{T5C610}
[Fake Sora]
I am you.


{T5C611}
[Fake Sora]
I am you, yourself.


{T5C612}
[Fake Sora]
Restoring system.

[Takeshi]
Shut up!

[Takeshi]
I don't want to hear it anymore!

Suddenly, I tore the voice converters out of
my ears.


74 :
The darkness in front of me started to turn
to mist.

I tried to fan it away from me with my hand.

My hand suddenly whacked against the wall.

Wall...!?

The corridor wall...!

I took the PDA out of my pocket and jammed
it into the crevice of the wall I had found.


75 :
I turned it toward the fake Sora's 'eyes',
her sensors... and set the backlight on
full. I hit the buttons repeatedly.


76 :

{T1A000}
[Announcement]
<System-Wiederaufnahme.>


77 :
My vision slowly returned...

The lighting was the same as always and was
illuminating the passage.

The RSD-generated ocean was nowhere to be
found.

I hurriedly placed the voice converters back
in my ears.

[Takeshi]
Sora!

[Takeshi]
Sora, where are you!?


78 :
The water level at my feet had fallen somewhat.

The watertight door was wide open.

The sprinklers had also stopped.

[Takeshi]
Sora!

[Takeshi]
Please! Sora, answer me!

There was no answer to my call.

She wasn't there.

She was nowhere to be found.

She'd been there only moments earlier, but no
trace of her remained.


79 :
Soon after, it was night.

In the conference room, Y¤u, £o¢o, and Pipi
were waiting.

Even the Kid...

It looked like the Kid had calmed down some.

While I'd been gone, it seemed that Y¤u and
£o¢o had been able to talk some sense into him.

Y¤u told me that he'd probably been upset by a
reoccurring memory and had gotten worked up
in spite of himself.

I felt that I'd gotten out of hand and had
said some terrible things myself.

I went around to everyone there and apologized.

Soon afterward...

A report came to us in the conference room,
directly from LeMMIH's terminal.

Y¤u read out the contents to all of us.


80 :
Third floor: Dritter Stock partition schematic‡L

The 'Cosmic Whale' room had flooded
completely.


81 :
Casualties: None.

Flooding to other rooms: None.

Chance of damage spreading: None...

Shivering slightly in the cold, I wrapped my
arms around my knees, and we all went to sleep.
