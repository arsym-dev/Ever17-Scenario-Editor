Two years later...

{YEP000}
[Y工]
Wow, this is great weather~

Y工 and I were riding on a boat.

The infinitely deep, blue ocean spread as far
as we could see.

A clear blue sky unfolded above us.

There was a pair of seagulls flying overhead.


The sea breeze whipped at us a little strongly,
and Y工 used her hand to hold her hair in
check.

She had recently started to grow her hair out.

It seemed that she was starting to look
more like 'her'.

That, and... she seemed to have become a bit
more easygoing and ladylike...


{YEP001}
[Y工]
So how is college going?

[Kid]
It's alright, I guess.

Yes. I had somehow gotten into college and
was in my first year.

Of course, I was going to a different school
than Y工, so we never had a chance to meet
on campus.


{YEP002}
[Y工]
"Why on earth did you decide to major in 
archaeology?"

[Kid]
You really want to know?


{YEP003}
[Y工]
That's why I'm asking.

[Kid]
"You know, it might be better if you didn't 
ask."


{YEP004}
[Y工]
Huh?

[Kid]
You still sure you want to know?


{YEP005}
[Y工]
W-well...


{YEP006}
[Y工]
Then I won't ask.

[Kid]
Alright. I won't tell.


{YEP007}
[Y工]
Huh?


{YEP008}
[Y工]
Why? Tell me!

[Kid]
But... you just said you weren't going to ask.


{YEP009}
[Y工]
"That's because you said I probably 
shouldn't..."

[Kid]
This is too confusing...


{YEP010}
[Y工]
"You're the one who made this conversation 
confusing."


{YEP011}
[Y工]
"Anyway, I guess I'll listen to your 
reasoning."

There she went changing her mind again.

[Kid]
You can really be twisted sometimes.


{YEP012}
[Y工]
Come on, say I'm pure at heart!

[Kid]
"What are you talking about? If you were pure, 
then I'd be..."

[Kid]
.........


{YEP013}
[Y工]
"Huh? You would be... what? Then you'd be 'the 
pure-hearted Kid'?"

[Kid]
Hey... Stop it.

[Kid]
I've changed since then...

But after that, I was reluctant to speak.

I wondered if I really was different from the
person I was at that time.

...I probably was.

Since then, no inexplicable, mysterious
things had happened to me.

I couldn't predict things anymore.

I had gotten my memory back.

...Or maybe... Maybe I was the same.

Maybe I was the same as ever.

I knew that people learned, got hurt, and lost
things... and that they changed as they
lived life.

But my basic nature hadn't changed.

Some things changed. Some things never did.

I was still 'me'... but myself in the past was
different...

If I had to explain it, I might say that it
was like 'me in another world'...

Maybe that was it.


{YEP014}
[Y工]
"You're right. You're not like you used 
to be."

[Kid]
?


{YEP015}
[Y工]
Well, for one thing you got so tall~

She stood on her tiptoes and raised her
hand over my head.

I had grown a head taller over the previous two
years.

{YEP016}
[Y工]
So are you going to tell me or not?

[Kid]
What?


{YEP017}
[Y工]
About the reason you majored in archaeology.

[Kid]
Alright... It's because...

[Kid]
I want to know myself better.


{YEP018}
[Y工]
To know yourself?

[Kid]
Yes.

[Kid]
To know more about myself at that time...

[Kid]
"At that time, I thought that it would be best 
to major in archaeology, the same as you, 
to better understand the weird stuff that 
was happening to me."


{YEP019}
[Y工]
You're not going to...


{YEP020}
[Y工]
Study the third eye?

[Kid]
I sure am.

[Y工]
............

[Kid]
I told you...

[Kid]
It was probably better that you don't ask.


{YEP021}
[Y工]
You haven't changed... A bit, I mean...


{YEP022}
[Y工]
Nope... You haven't changed at all.

[Kid]
Neither have you.

[Kid]
That reminds me. Your clothes are...


{YEP023}
[Y工]
Huh?

[Kid]
The same ones you wore then, right?


{YEP024}
[Y工]
Yeah... You're right.

There was a thin black stain on the hem of her
jacket that had remained.

It was a memorable stain.

Our memory...

I started to think as I gazed at the ocean.

I thought about the time when I met Y工.

About those unforgettable seven days...

But I should talk about the things that
happened after that.

After that...


3 :
For some time, we just stood there enjoying
the sunshine on the floating island.

The sun looked extremely bright after a week
without it. Its rays were warm.

At that moment...

Someone patted me on the shoulder.

I turned back and...

There was...


4 :

{YEP025}
[Sora]
Good morning.


5 :
[Kid]
...So-So-So-Sora!?


{YEP026}
[Sora]
"I promised you that I would see you again 
soon, didn't I?"

[Kid]
Bu-but... why are you here?


6 :

{YEP027}
[Sora]
Am I bothering you?


{YEP028}
[Y工]
No, not all! I'm glad to see you again.


7 :
Hearing that, Sora smiled gently.

I exchanged a handshake with Sora when
I met her again.


8 :
I looked up at the sky above.

The clear blue sky seemed to spread on forever.


{YEP029}
[Sora]
Doctor Tanaka is waiting for you.


{YEP030}
[Sora]
Please come this way...


9 :
[Kid]
Oh, you're...!

The person called 'Doctor Tanaka' who appeared in
front of us was the woman I'd seen on the
monitor...

It was the person who had claimed to be
Y工's mother.


{YEP031}
[Y工]
M-mother...


{YEP032}
[Doctor Tanaka]
Y工... I'm so happy you're alive...


{YEP033}
[Y工]
Why are you...?


{YEP034}
[Doctor Tanaka]
"I promised that I would tell you everything 
when you got to the floating island, right?"

[Y工]
...............


{YEP035}
[Doctor Tanaka]
It's been a long time...

[Kid]
What?

I wondered if she was talking to me.

It seemed like it was the first time that
I'd met her...

Or had I met her in the past...?


{YEP036}
[Doctor Tanaka]
"What's wrong? Is there something that 
you would like to ask?"

[Kid]
Y-yes! I have tons of things I want to ask.


{YEP037}
[Doctor Tanaka]
Fine. Don't worry, I'll tell you everything.

[Kid]
Alright then... F-first, I want to...


{YEP038}
[Y工]
Hold on!


{YEP039}
[Y工]
Wait just a minute...

[Kid]
...Y工?


{YEP040}
[Y工]
First, there's something I have to ask.


{YEP041}
[Y工]
Is that alright?


{YEP042}
[Doctor Tanaka]
Go ahead.

[Y工]
.........


{YEP043}
[Y工]
You said... that you're not my real mother.


{YEP044}
[Y工]
You also said that I was your child.

[Doctor Tanaka]
.........


{YEP045}
[Y工]
There's only one thing I want to ask.


{YEP046}
[Y工]
Are you... my real 'mother'?


10 :
[Doctor Tanaka]
...............

Doctor Tanaka looked down.

She twisted her lips sadly.


{YEP047}
[Y工]
Which is it?

I wondered why Y工 would ask such a thing.

She should've already known the answer...


{YEP048}
[Doctor Tanaka]
...<I am You>...


{YEP049}
[Y工]
...Huh?


11 :

{YEP050}
[Doctor Tanaka]
I can say this for certain now...


{YEP051}
[Doctor Tanaka]
I am... your...


{YEP052}
[Doctor Tanaka]
'Mother'... Y工...

She stared Y工 in the eye as she said that.


{YEP053}
[Y工]
...Mother...

..................


12 :
After a while, we asked Doctor Tanaka question
after question.

{16:4}

13 :
...How did we get trapped?

...Was it an accident or not?

...Why could I predict things?

...Why did I lose my memory?

...What had happened in my past?

...Did the girl I'd seen really exist?
Who was she?

...What had happened in Y工's past?

{16:4}

14 :
...Did Y工's father and mother really die?

...If so, then who was she... 'Doctor Tanaka'?


...What was the meaning of the haiku
password?

...What was Blick Winkel?

...What was the connection between the
TB virus and the accident?

And...

{16:4}

15 :
What was 'the third eye'?

.........

......

...

{16:4}

16 :


{1}{1}{1}{1}

{16:0}It was a long, long story.{16:1}

{16:4}

17 :

{YEP054}
[Y工]
"You're thinking about the things that 
happened then, aren't you?"

[Kid]
Huh? Yeah...

[Kid]
Hey, Y工?

[Kid]
"Do you know the proverb 'Water flows and 
people live'?"


{YEP055}
[Y工]
?

[Kid]
Water flows from high to lower places...

[Kid]
"But the flow, its path has an infinite 
number of possibilities."

[Kid]
"People live... Just like water, there are
infinite ways for life to flow."

[Kid]
That's what it means.


{YEP056}
[Y工]
Hmmmm.

[Kid]
"If life has infinite possibilities, there 
might be another me somewhere who has a 
different history than the me in the present."


{YEP057}
[Y工]
Somewhere?

[Kid]
Yeah, say, beyond this broad sky...

[Kid]
Beyond this limitless universe...

[Kid]
There should be another universe...

[Kid]
Another me in another universe...

[Y工]
.........

[Kid]
I was thinking about that other me.


{YEP058}
[Y工]
Another universe, huh?


{YEP059}
[Y工]
"Hey, if there is another universe like 
you say..."


{YEP060}
[Y工]
"In that other world, is there another pair of
us dating like we are now?"

[Kid]
Sure there is.


{YEP061}
[Y工]
How can you tell?

[Kid]
I can tell because I can.


{YEP062}
[Y工]
?

[Kid]
You see, if I do this...


18 :
I drew Y工 close and kissed her.


We were surrounded by the spring sun, clouds
floating in the sky, the rippling ocean, and
the song of seagulls.

I felt everything about Y工 through her skin.

Her warmth, her scent, her touch, her heartbeat,
and even the color of her heart...

I could see through Y工 completely then.

It was exactly... the third eye.

Ultimate wisdom.

Yes, if I did that...
