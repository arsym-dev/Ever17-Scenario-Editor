1 :
Moonlight shone into the sickroom.


2 :
I heard a voice crying somewhere.

The muffled voice kept sniveling and sobbing
again and again.

Who... Who was it...?

Who are you...?

I... didn't know... what I was escaping from...


3 :
Waiting... for what?

Was I waiting for me?

And where in the world was that?

It was... It was...

Just then, the scene dissolved away.


4 :

{1}{1}{1}

{S5A002}
{16:0}You ran away!{16:1}

{S5A003}
{16:0}You left that girl and ran away!{16:1}

{16:4}

5 :
That voice kept repeating itself in my head.

Wait! Tell me!

I didn't know what I had run from or to where!

What was I...?


6 :
Gradually, the scenery around me began to
change into eerie colors...


7 :
I woke up and almost leaped out of the bed.

I was in the infirmary.

My body was drenched in sweat.


8 :
‡LOuch!

A sharp pain shot through my right arm.

I looked at my right arm and stared, confused,
at the cast on it.

I didn't know why...


9 :
Then I remembered. I had broken my arm and was
resting...

I was still foggy from the drugs. A string of
hazy memories came back to me.

I remembered the scary dream I had.

I thought it was from the fever and medicine.

I was sure of it.

That was why I had such bizarre dreams.

I shook my head and tried to get a better grip
on my consciousness.

I looked at the clock on the wall. It was a
bit past two in the morning.

Normally, it would be the middle of the night...

But somehow, it didn't feel like that at all.

I tried to remember how long we had been
trapped there...

An extended stay in there, where the
cycles of day and night were meaningless, really
played with one's sense of time.

I sat up, taking care to watch out for
my broken arm.

‡LClank.

Sara's pendant was by my left hand.

It looked like I had fallen asleep with it
clasped in my hand.

[Kid]
I've gotta return this.

I slipped off of the bed.

My right arm felt slightly feverish, but
because the medicine Takeshi had injected
was probably still working, it didn't hurt
much.

But I was still unable to move it normally.

Next to the pillow was a sling for me to hang
my arm in.

I wondered if Takeshi had left it. Or maybe
Y¤u.

Either way, I couldn't just let my hurt arm
swing back and forth as I walked. I put it on.

I thought about where Sara might be...

I figured she might be asleep.

I wondered where she always slept.

An image of Sara atop the whale floated into
my mind.

I decided to try there first...

If she wasn't there, then I'd try somewhere
else.

Still a bit groggy, I left the infirmary.


10 :
I went down in the elevator and headed for
the Cosmic Whale.


11 :
I heard the sound of splashing.


It wasn't from the... generator room.

It sounded like it came from the pipe room.

[Kid]
I wonder what that is.


12 :
When I entered the room...


13 :
‡L!

[Kid]
S-Sara!

The moment I saw what was happening, I jumped
into the water.


14 :
After I jumped, I remembered that my arm
was broken, but it was too late.

I swam toward Sara, doing the best I could with
my arm.

[Kid]
Sara, grab hold!


{S5A004}
[Sara]
Huh? Kid, what're you doing?

[Kid]
Just grab hold of me!

I tried to grab Sara, but she swam away
from me.


{S5A005}
[Sara]
Just leave me alone!

[Kid]
Huh? W-w-wait, Sara?


{S5A006}
[Sara]
I said stay away from me, pervert!

[Kid]
Pervert... What?

Then I noticed something a little bit strange.

If I stretched my legs, I could just touch
the floor.


15 :
[Kid]
Sa-Sara?


{S5A007}
[Sara]
What?

[Kid]
Uh, what're you doing?


{S5A008}
[Sara]
Just what it looks like.

[Kid]
"...I don't know what it looks like. That's 
why I asked."


{S5A009}
[Sara]
I'm practicing swimming.

[Kid]
Practicing... swimming?


{S5A010}
[Sara]
Yes. Just what it looks like?


16 :

{1}{1}{1}

{16:0}(As if I would know!?){16:1}

{16:0}(Flailing around like that...){16:1}

{16:0}(Anyone would think you were drowning!){16:1}

{16:4}

17 :
That was the comeback I launched in my mind.
But what came out of my mouth was...

[Kid]
Oh... I see... Well, geez...

...Only that stupid line.


18 :

{S5A011}
[Sara]
"Well, since you've seen me, I guess I'll 
tell you."


19 :

{S5A012}
[Sara]
I actually don't know how to swim.

As she said that, Sara continued flapping
about madly in the water as if she were
sinking.


20 :

{S5A013}
[Sara]
"I realized that we have all this time... and I 
found a swimsuit in the changing room."


21 :
Distracted, I hadn't noticed...

But when she told me, I did for the first time.
Sara was decked out like a LeMU employee in a
one-piece swimsuit.

I wondered why I hadn't noticed...

I blushed with embarrassment.

{16:4}

22 :
But still...

Watching Sara's movements, it would have been
more of a stretch to imagine her swimming than
drowning.

Besides, the medicine was still affecting me...

I was making up all kinds of excuses.

{16:4}

23 :
But Sara didn't notice my confusion
and kept at it.


{S5A014}
[Sara]
"So I thought that I would try to get in a 
little swim practice."


{S5A015}
[Sara]
I mean, the water here isn't all that cold.

Once she mentioned it, I realized the
water was warmer than in the corridors.

I imagined the heat from the pipes had warmed
it.


{S5A016}
[Sara]
So I was practicing swimming all alone.

[Kid]
I thought you were a ninja? Ninja can...


24 :

{S5A017}
[Sara]
"Well, swimming is the only skill 
I'm not good at..."

[Kid]
I see...


{S5A018}
[Sara]
Just between you and me...


{S5A019}
[Sara]
"Unfortunately, my swimming was so bad that 
I wasn't promoted to a master."

[Kid]
Is that right...?


25 :

{S5A020}
[Sara]
Ah, heehee...

[Kid]
Wh-what?


{S5A021}
[Sara]
"Heehee. Kid, you take everything so 
seriously. Nin! Nin! Ninja!"

[Kid]
Oh... So... that was a joke!


{S5A022}
[Sara]
Sure it was. Me? A ninja?

[Kid]
B-but...


{S5A023}
[Sara]
Ahaha, but it's true that I can't swim.


26 :

{S5A024}
[Sara]
"And being in this situation and not being 
able to swim... It makes me nervous."


{S5A025}
[Sara]
"I think I'm probably the only one here who 
can't swim."


27 :

{S5A026}
[Sara]
You can swim, right, Kid?

[Kid]
I...

I hadn't thought about it, but I thought I'd
been swimming alright a minute ago.

That meant that I could swim.

[Kid]
Yeah... I can swim.


28 :

{S5A027}
[Sara]
That's perfect! Will you teach me?

29 :
{11:0-1a}
{11:1}Uh, I don't think so...

{11:1}I suppose...


30 :
[Kid]
Uh, I don't think so...


31 :

{S5A028}
[Sara]
Oh, why not?

[Kid]
Well, my arm is no good like this...

My broken arm actually felt like it was on
fire, probably because I had strained it
trying to swim.


32 :

{S5A029}
[Sara]
"That's okay. You can just watch and tell me 
what I'm doing wrong."

[Kid]
"But I know you won't listen to anything 
I say..."


{S5A030}
[Sara]
Sure I will! I'll listen!

[Kid]
Really?


{S5A031}
[Sara]
For sure. I promise!

[Kid]
I bet your fingers are crossed...


33 :

{S5A032}
[Sara]
Oh, there you go again!


34 :
Sara splashed water at me.

[Kid]
I'm just kidding...


{S5A033}
[Sara]
"Now you've made me mad. I can't believe you'd 
say that."

[Kid]
"So you don't want me to teach you how to 
swim?"


{S5A034}
[Sara]
Aw... You're tricky!


{S5A035}
[Sara]
"I think you've got samurai in you, so you 
better fight fair!"

[Kid]
"I'm not samurai, and I'm not fighting about 
anything."


{S5A036}
[Sara]
Ohhh! You're so difficult!

[Kid]
Difficult...?


{S5A037}
[Sara]
"Forget it! That's it, you're 
teaching me to swim."

[Kid]
Hey, it's not all up to you.


{S5A038}
[Sara]
"I didn't decide it. It's fate. Inevitable and 
decided by the stars!"

[Kid]
Uh...


35 :

{S5A039}
[Sara]
It's settled!

[Kid]
Hey, quit making up my mind for me!


36 :

{S5A040}
[Sara]
You sure whine a lot for a guy!


{S5A041}
[Sara]
When something is decided, you accept it.

[Kid]
So when exactly was this decided?


{S5A042}
[Sara]
"EXACTLY right now. I decided, so it's 
decided. Kid, you're gonna teach me to swim!"

I didn't think there was any point to
continuing the argument.

[Kid]
Alright. Fine. I'll teach you.


{S5A043}
[Sara]
"It would've been easier if you had said that 
in the first place!"


37 :
[Kid]
I suppose...


{S5A044}
[Sara]
Huh?

[Kid]
"Well, I'm already soaked to the bone... 
I might as well teach you a little."


{S5A045}
[Sara]
You mean it? Alright!


{S5A046}
[Sara]
"Wow. You're being surprisingly nice, 
aren't you?"

[Kid]
No I'm not.


{S5A047}
[Sara]
Oh! I know what it is.

[Kid]
Wh-what?


38 :

{S5A048}
[Sara]
"It's because I look so good in this swimsuit! 
Better keep your hands off!"

[Kid]
I... d-don't know what you're talking about!


{S5A049}
[Sara]
"Oh! See! I can tell I'm right 'cause you're 
getting all worked up!"


39 :
[Kid]
Fine! I won't teach you anything then!


40 :

{S5A050}
[Sara]
Oh, no, wait! Pleaaaaaaasssee~

[Kid]
.........


{S5A051}
[Sara]
I won't tease you anymore~


41 :
[Kid]
Promise?


42 :

{S5A052}
[Sara]
Yeah. I promise.

[Kid]
Hmmm.


{S5A053}
[Sara]
"I said I promise! I swear to God, to Buddha, and 
to anyone else who'll listen!"

[Kid]
Well... alright.


{S5A054}
[Sara]
Really? You know I love you, right?

[Kid]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Anyway... I should be going...


43 :

{S5A055}
[Sara]
Ohhhhh, I'm kidding! Come back here!

Sara flapped her arms about, making even more
spray.

[Kid]
Oh, alright. I'll teach you, okay?


{S5A056}
[Sara]
Yeah!


{S5A057}
[Sara]
I was so hoping that you would say that!

[Kid]
I said stop that...


44 :
[Kid]
Sara, you've gotta relax more!

[Kid]
Just be natural.

[Kid]
Sara!

I had to strain my voice to be heard over
Sara's splashing.

I had gotten out of the water.

With my right arm in a sling, there were only
so many ways to teach swimming.

I just watched what she was doing and hollered
out advice.

But... no matter what I said, she still looked
clumsy.

[Kid]
"If you keep that up, you'll never learn to 
swim!"


{S5A058}
[Sara]
Well, what am I s'posed to do? *Pant*, *pant*...


{S5A059}
[Sara]
I'm doing my best to do just like you said.

[Kid]
I see...

[Kid]
You can't swim if you're so tense!

[Kid]
You need to be smoother...


{S5A060}
[Sara]
Like this?


45 :
‡LSplish, splash, splish, splash!

She only whirled the water into a bigger froth
with more spray.

[Kid]
Whoa! S-Sara, slow down!

I shouted instructions as I avoided the spray
showering down around me.

[Kid]
Are you doing that on purpose?


{S5A061}
[Sara]
Why would I?


{S5A062}
[Sara]
Whaddya expect me to do?

[Kid]
You've gotta move more slowly... gently...


{S5A063}
[Sara]
"How am I supposed to know what you mean 
by gentle? What else can I do?"


{S5A064}
[Sara]
You're no good at teaching!

That ticked me off.


46 :
[Kid]
Oh, I know.


47 :

{S5A065}
[Sara]
What?

[Kid]
"Sara, you don't need to learn to swim, 
do you?"


{S5A066}
[Sara]
Of course I do!

[Kid]
Hmmm. Really?


48 :

{S5A067}
[Sara]
Wh-whaddya mean?

[Kid]
Listen, Sara.

[Kid]
If you REALLY want to learn to swim...

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Then you should listen to what I say.


49 :

{S5A068}
[Sara]
Oh...

[Kid]
If you can't listen to what I say...

[Kid]
Then I'll be going.


{S5A069}
[Sara]
Oh...

[Kid]
Do you want me to teach you to swim?


{S5A070}
[Sara]
...Yes.

[Kid]
So is there anything you want to say to me?


50 :

{S5A071}
[Sara]
Mmmmm...

Sara glared at me menacingly.

[Kid]
If not, then...

I pretended I was about to leave.


51 :

{S5A072}
[Sara]
Uh, I'm sorry...

[Kid]
What? Did you say something?


{S5A073}
[Sara]
I said I'm sorry!


{S5A074}
[Sara]
Now, just teach me without being mean.


52 :

{S5A075}
[Sara]
P-W-E-T-T-Y P-W-E-A-S-E!

[Kid]
Don't talk like a baby!


53 :

{S5A076}
[Sara]
A wittle bit is fine... no?


54 :

{S5A077}
[Sara]
"Besides, I think I look pretty good 
in a swimsuit."


{S5A078}
[Sara]
You should be happy just to be around me.

[Kid]
...Not even a little.


55 :

{1}{1}

Truthfully, Sara was something in a swimsuit.


But I couldn't tell her that.

I didn't want her to get full of herself.

{16:4}

56 :
[Kid]
"Now why should I be so happy about seeing 
you in a swimsuit?"


{S5A079}
[Sara]
Oh! You're such a jerk.


57 :
Sara started kicking and showered me with
water.

[Kid]
Whoa! Stop that right now!


{S5A080}
[Sara]
"Then you tell the truth! You like me 
in a swimsuit, right?"

[Kid]
Why would I? You in a swimsuit...?

I was blushing, completely giving away my
feelings.


58 :

{S5A081}
[Sara]
Oh! Look! You're getting red.


59 :

{S5A082}
[Sara]
See! You do like seeing me!

[Kid]
You're not listening to me!


{S5A083}
[Sara]
You're a guy.

[Kid]
What's that supposed to mean?


{S5A084}
[Sara]
"Well, any healthy guy in his right mind would 
like to be with a beautiful girl in a bathing 
suit."

[Kid]
It's not like that.


{S5A085}
[Sara]
"You're saying that even though you want to 
sneak a better look."

[Kid]
I said I don't!

[Kid]
I've had enough. I'm leaving!


60 :
I was embarrassed because she'd seen through
me. I really meant to leave the room.


{S5A086}
[Sara]
Aiiiieeee!

I heard Sara scream behind me.


61 :
[Kid]
Sara?

I hurriedly looked behind me.

[Kid]
Sara? Sara?

[Kid]
What's the matter?

I wondered if her leg had cramped.

I sprinted to the water's edge.

And then...


62 :
‡LSplash!

Water suddenly sprayed in my eyes, blinding me.

The next thing I knew, I had slipped and was
spinning in the air.


63 :
‡LCrasplash!

The following instant, I was in the water.

[Kid]
Aaagghhh!

It all happened so quickly that I swallowed a
ton of water. And some went up my nose.

My nose stung.

I desperately fought to get to the surface.


64 :
[Kid]
Phwaw! Sara!


{S5A087}
[Sara]
Whaaaaaaat is it?


65 :
Sara, pretending that nothing had happened,
had resumed her swim practice.

[Kid]
*Cough*, *sputter*... Sara, you're mean!

I approached Sara.


{S5A088}
[Sara]
Paaa... AHAHAhaaaaaa!

[Kid]
Wh-what?


{S5A089}
[Sara]
"You fall for EVERYTHING so easily! 
Heehee..."

[Kid]
S-Sara!


{S5A090}
[Sara]
"It would seem you're still wet behind the 
ears, Kid."


{S5A091}
[Sara]
Paaa... AHAHAhaaaaaa!

Seeing Sara laughing with such enthusiasm, I
realized that getting any angrier was
pointless.

Actually, for some reason, I started to laugh.

[Kid]
...Hee... Kyahahahaha...


{S5A092}
[Sara]
Ahahahahaha!

[Kid]
Hahahahahahahaha!

Sara and I laughed for a while.


66 :
[Kid]
Anyway...

Once my fit of laughter was done, I got out of
the water.


{S5A093}
[Sara]
Uh, Kid...

Sara called out to me shyly.

[Kid]
So should we start?


{S5A094}
[Sara]
Uh... Yeah.


67 :

{S5A095}
[Sara]
"Okay, wise teacher! Please douse me with 
swimming knowledge!"

[Kid]
"You know I'm pretty strict. You think you can 
handle it?"


{S5A096}
[Sara]
Yes, sir!

[Kid]
Okay. Then let's get started.


{S5A097}
[Sara]
Okay.


68 :
[Kid]
"Listen. I think with you, Sara, your body 
gets tight because you think you can't swim."

[Kid]
So you have to relax more.


{S5A098}
[Sara]
"But... I'm trying to do it just the way you 
say..."

[Kid]
"Yeah, but you're so stiff. Like a scarecrow, 
or you're made of wood, or something..."

[Kid]
"You need to let your legs flow freely... like 
a fish, maybe."


{S5A099}
[Sara]
A fish... Alright then, I'm a fish now.

[Kid]
Okay, Sara! You need to get pumped!


{S5A100}
[Sara]
I just can't picture what you mean.

[Kid]
"Well, if you can't imagine a fish, then how 
about a dolphin or whale... Anyway, you have 
to be relaxed and move freely."


{S5A101}
[Sara]
Uuuuh...

[Kid]
No. You're still too stiff! Relax more.

[Kid]
Just let your feet go!

Somehow, teaching her to swim had become fun.


It was fun to see Sara, who was always in
control of things, in the opposite position.

[Kid]
Sara!


{S5A102}
[Sara]
Mmmmmmm~


69 :
I waited for Sara to emerge from the changing
room.

I played with her pendant.


Looking at it without the flame or the
lighter, it was just a mirror.

I ran my finger around the edge of the pendant.


70 :
I thought about what Sara had said in the
compression chamber.


{S4A090}
[Sara]
Both of my parents are gone.

Sara had looked so sad as she'd said it.


71 :

{S5A103}
[Sara]
Sorry I took so long.


72 :

{S5A104}
[Sara]
What's wrong? Why the glum face?

[Kid]
Oh, it's nothing.

[Kid]
But I brought this...


73 :

{S5A105}
[Sara]
Oh, you brought it for me.


{S5A106}
[Sara]
"Sorry you had to stick around teaching me 
until the end."

[Kid]
You're the one that made me stay...

I mumbled that.


{S5A107}
[Sara]
Huh? What did you say?

[Kid]
Oh, nothing.


74 :

{S5A108}
[Sara]
Well, anyway, thanks a lot...


{S5A109}
[Sara]
And thanks for hanging out until the end.

[Kid]
What?

I was taken aback. I was waiting for some
witty comeback.

But Sara was sincerely saying thanks.

[Kid]
"W-wow. You're being surprisingly nice 
to me..."


75 :

{S5A110}
[Sara]
Yeah, well, I'm really grateful.


{S5A111}
[Sara]
Because I finally learned to swim by myself.


76 :

{S5A112}
[Sara]
Only a little bit, but...


77 :

{S5A113}
[Sara]
"But it was fun. I was happy you were so 
serious about it..."

[Kid]
Sara...

I got a little bit embarrassed.

Somehow, watching Sara struggle with something
when she was used to always having her way
was kind of fun.

I had taught her how to swim correctly, but I
did have an urge to be a bit of a bully about
it.

Still, I never thought that she would come out
and say, 'Thanks'...


78 :

{S5A114}
[Sara]
I really mean it. Thanks, Kid.

[Kid]
"Y-yeah. But don't let it go to your head, 
because you can't really call what you were 
doing swimming."

I was embarrassed and reflexively went into
mean mode.


{S5A115}
[Sara]
"I know. If we have another chance, I hope 
you'll teach me again."

[Kid]
S-sure.


79 :

{S5A116}
[Sara]
Next time, I'll really learn to swim.

[Kid]
Yeah. You just need a little more practice.


80 :

{S5A117}
[Sara]
Teach me again. Nin! Nin! Ninja!

[Kid]
Ahaha. Sure.


81 :

{S5A118}
[Sara]
Somehow, I'm tired out...

As she spoke, Sara took the pendant and put
it on.

Then she took it in her hand and stared at it.


82 :

{S5A119}
[Sara]
"I'll bet if my onii-chan was around it would 
be kinda like this..."

Sara mumbled it, sounding lonely.

[Kid]
Your onii-chan?


83 :

{S5A120}
[Sara]
Yes. I...


84 :

{S5A121}
[Sara]
I had an older brother...


{S5A122}
[Sara]
He was fun, strong, and I adored him...


85 :

{S5A123}
[Sara]
But when we were little, we got separated...

[Kid]
I see...


86 :

{S5A124}
[Sara]
But he promised me...

[Kid]
Promised you?


{S5A125}
[Sara]
Yeah, he promised.


{S5A126}
[Sara]
"He promised that he would come get me no 
matter what..."

[Kid]
Is that right?


87 :

{S5A127}
[Sara]
Yup...


88 :

{S5A128}
[Sara]
So... I'm waiting for him.


89 :

{S5A129}
[Sara]
Waiting for him to come save me... Always...

Sara's words brought back a vision I had
seen.


90 :

{S3B105}
{16:0x}Yeah, I promise.{16:1}



{S3B106}
{16:0x}To wait like a good girl.{1}
Until you come for me...{16:1}



{S3B107}
{16:0x}I'll wait... like a good girl...{16:1}



{S3B108}
{16:0x}I'll wait... forever...{16:1}

{16:4}

91 :
I desperately tried to shake off the vision...


92 :
The next morning, I overslept.

I thought I might be in trouble with
everyone...

But it seemed like I wasn't the only one.

The late start pushed our breakfast time back
later than usual.

{16:4}

93 :
We wanted a change of pace, to do something
fun, so we spread out a blanket in the park's
rest area.

The blanket was from a shop that stocked them
on the same floor. So it had LeMU's Myumyun
label printed on it.

Sora couldn't eat, but she sat with us
smiling just the same.

Drawn by the scent, Tsugumi appeared.

As if she didn't notice or didn't care,
Tsugumi parked herself on Myumyun's face
and started munching on a sandwich.

Of course, Takeshi started complaining, but
Tsugumi just ignored him.

Sara and Tsugumi didn't look at each other. It
seemed like they were ignoring each other.

Apparently, they still weren't getting along.

But everybody tried to make the best of it,
eating, chatting, and having fun.


94 :

{Y5A075}
[Sara]
Ready, Ro Sham Bo!


{Y5A076}
[Sara]
Ready, go!

[Kid]
I lost again!


95 :

{Y5A077}
[Y¤u]
"Kid, you're terrible at this. What is that? 
Sixteen losses in a row?"

[Kid]
Weird...


{Y5A078}
[Y¤u]
"You're too nice. You have to just throw out 
what you feel: rock, paper, or scissors."


96 :

{Y5A079}
[Sara]
He's the gullible type.

[Kid]
I am not. I'm trying to win.


97 :

{Y5A080}
[Y¤u]
Ready, go!

[Kid]
Dang it!

I just kept losing.


98 :

{Y5A081}
[Y¤u]
"Could be that, with your amnesia, your 
ability to make decisions isn't so good 
right now."


99 :

{Y5A082}
[Y¤u]
"Don't get too caught up with the trivial 
things that you can't control."


{Y5A083}
[Y¤u]
"You need to be strong. Make up your own mind. 
Or you'll just end up following everybody else."

[Kid]
I know...


100 :

{Y5A084}
[Y¤u]
That being as it is...


101 :

{Y5A085}
[Sara]
Time for the LOSER'S PENALTY!


102 :

{Y5A086}
[Y¤u]
Hand over your sandwich.

[Kid]
.........

Silently, I held out my sandwich.


{Y5A087}
[Sara]
Alrighty~


103 :
She squeezed a ton of mustard onto
my sandwich.

The penalty was mustard. And my sandwich was
already drenched in the stuff.

My mouth felt like it was on fire before I
even took a bite.

...Maybe thanks to that silly exchange, I was
able to get through the whole thing without
thinking about it too much.

Suddenly, someone cut across my field of
vision.

It was Tsugumi.

Tsugumi was walking toward Takeshi. She
extended her hand.


104 :

{Y5A088}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What's with the hand?

[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A089}
[Takeshi]
You're like a dog. Shake, girl.


{Y5A090}
[Takeshi]
"And you'll probably say 'Don't make fun 
of me!'"


105 :

{Y5A091}
[Tsugumi]
You're really dumb, you know that?


106 :

{Y5A092}
[Sora]
"Are you trying to say that you want another 
helping?"


107 :
Tsugumi nodded at Sora's extra explanation.

She had already wolfed down her first one.


{Y5A093}
[Takeshi]
"Hey... You've gotta lot of nerve... You only 
show your face at meal time, and now you're 
demanding seconds..."


108 :

{Y5A094}
[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose...


109 :

{Y5A095}
[Tsugumi]
So do you have more or not?


110 :

{Y5A096}
[Takeshi]
"I do. I thought you might want more, so 
I made a SPECIAL one for you."


111 :
[Kid]
Special?

I had a bad feeling about the whole thing.


{Y5A097}
[Takeshi]
Eat this. And no leftovers.


112 :
[Tsugumi]
...

Tsugumi took the sandwich without saying
anything.

[Takeshi]
...

Takeshi stared at Tsugumi as she took the wrap
off of the sandwich.


113 :

{Y5A098}
[Tsugumi]
...What?


{Y5A099}
[Takeshi]
"Nothing. It's just that you're so beautiful. 
I can't take my eyes off of you even when 
you're just removing a sandwich wrapper..."


{Y5A100}
[Tsugumi]
Your stupidity is terminal.


{Y5A101}
[Tsugumi]
Maybe if you died 50 times it would help.


114 :
[Takeshi]
...


115 :
I thought Takeshi would get angry.

But he was just grinning as he watched Tsugumi
start in on her sandwich.

Something was definitely not right there.
I sucked in my breath and watched.


116 :
Tsugumi bit into the sandwich.

Munch.

Chomp. Chew.


117 :

{Y5A102}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm?


{Y5A103}
[Takeshi]
Heeheee~


{Y5A104}
[Takeshi]
Fwaaahahahahaha~

[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A105}
[Takeshi]
"It's got quite a flavor, huh? That 
sandwich... Hahaha..."

Takeshi laughed so hard he cried.


{Y5A106}
[Takeshi]
"It's packed with mustard, Tabasco, pepper, 
sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, mint, and a dose of 
curry powder..."


{Y5A107}
[Takeshi]
"For good measure, I added a dose of 
mayonnaise, ketchup, sugar, salt, soy sauce, 
vinegar, and vanilla..."


118 :

{Y5A108}
[Takeshi]
And... what else? Oh, I forget...


119 :

{Y5A109}
[Takeshi]
"Anyway, I threw in every ingredient and spice 
that I could find. It's my secret 34-ingredient 
sauce."


120 :
[Tsugumi]
...


{Y5A110}
[Y¤u]
H-hey! That's just too cruel!


{Y5A111}
[Sara]
Yeah...!

[Kid]
That's going too far, Takeshi!


121 :

{Y5A112}
[Takeshi]
Shut up! I'm the cook here.


{Y5A113}
[Sora]
"Ko-Komachi-san... I highly recommend inducing 
vomiting immediately...!"


122 :

{Y5A114}
[Sora]
"Get water quickly! N-no... We'll need 
medicine first...!"


123 :

{Y5A115}
[Takeshi]
"She'll be fine. She'll get the runs, 
but she won't die."

[Kid]
That's not something you should do to a girl.

I went to grab Takeshi with my left hand.


124 :

{Y5A116}
[Tsugumi]
Wait. I'm fine.

Tsugumi mumbled that, stopping us.


125 :

{Y5A117}
[Takeshi]
Huh, well aren't you tough!


{Y5A118}
[Tsugumi]
I'm perfectly fine.


126 :

{Y5A119}
[Takeshi]
"But it still tastes terrible, right? Right? 
Tell the truth."


127 :

{Y5A120}
[Tsugumi]
I'm totally fine...


128 :

{Y5A121}
[Tsugumi]
It tastes kind of like pizza.


129 :
[Kid]
......

[Takeshi]
......

[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
............

[Sora]
...............


130 :
What?


131 :

{Y5A122}
[Takeshi]
What did you just say? What's it taste like?


{Y5A123}
[Tsugumi]
Pizza.


{Y5A124}
[Takeshi]
Are you serious?

Tsugumi nodded.


132 :
[Takeshi]
.........


{Y5A125}
[Tsugumi]
*Munch*, *munch*...


133 :

{Y5A126}
[Takeshi]
Hey... Let me see that! That can't be!


134 :
Takeshi went to grab the sandwich, but Tsugumi
was too quick for him. Not only that, Takeshi
caught his foot and fell to the floor.

In that instant, Tsugumi polished off the
sandwich.


135 :

{Y5A127}
[Tsugumi]
Thanks for the sandwich.


{Y5A128}
[Tsugumi]
You made it specially for me, right?

[Takeshi]
............

So the event ended with Tsugumi turning the
tables on Takeshi.


136 :
I ended up cleaning the area afterward.

I separated the cans and sandwich wrappers
and put them in garbage bags.

Y¤u and Sara helped.

Takeshi said he was going to start getting
ready for lunch and headed to the kiosk.

Sora said she had to do some maintenance on
LeMMIH and left for the control room.

Tsugumi disappeared to somewhere unknown.

...

But something happened when I was picking up
garbage.


137 :
{1}

{T5B003}
{16:0}Yahoo~{16:1}

138 :
[Kid]
Huh?


139 :

{Y5A129}
[Y¤u]
What? What's the matter?

[Kid]
Nothing...

[Kid]
Did somebody just call out?


140 :

{Y5A130}
[Y¤u]
What?


{Y5A131}
[Sara]
Nobody said anything.

[Kid]
Really? Must be my imagination...


141 :

{Y5A132}
[Sara]
"I'll bet you're just trying to find a way to 
get out of helping."

[Kid]
I'm not. It's not that at all.


142 :

{Y5A133}
[Y¤u]
You hearing your mystery voices again?

[Kid]
Well, I...


143 :

{Y5A134}
[Y¤u]
"Please don't do that again. Get a hold of 
yourself already."


{Y5A135}
[Y¤u]
I know you're tired, but...

[Kid]
.........


144 :
We started picking up garbage again.


145 :
We finally finished with the trash, folded the
blanket, and were done cleaning up.


146 :

{Y5A136}
[Y¤u]
Now we'll just sweep the area.


147 :

{Y5A137}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo. Can you do me a favor and get me a 
broom and dustpan? I think they're at the 
kiosk."


148 :

{Y5A138}
[Sara]
Roger that!


149 :
Sara set out for the kiosk.

[Kid]
"I was just thinking. This must be a nightmare 
for the people that clean this place."


150 :

{Y5A139}
[Y¤u]
It would be if 'people' had to do it.


{Y5A140}
[Y¤u]
"But LeMMIH usually uses a cleaning robot that 
automatically cleans the whole complex."

[Kid]
Wow.


151 :

{Y5A141}
[Y¤u]
"Well, what with the accident and all, I 
imagine the robot is a rusted pile of junk 
metal at the bottom of the ocean right 
about now."

[Kid]
I'll bet.


152 :
{1}

{T5B017}
{16:0}Here we go...{16:1}

153 :
(...What?)

I... I was hearing voices again.


154 :

{Y5A142}
[Y¤u]
"Thinking about it, I guess that LeMU is just 
one massive pile of scrap metal."


{Y5A143}
[Y¤u]
"I suppose it's just a matter of how it's 
destroyed..."


155 :

{Y5A144}
[Y¤u]
What? What's the matter?

[Kid]
Um...


156 :

{Y5A145}
[Y¤u]
You're not... Not again?

[Kid]
...


{Y5A146}
[Y¤u]
"Oh... Alright. You've done enough. Just go to 
the infirmary or somewhere and rest."


{Y5A147}
[Y¤u]
"You've got a serious condition or 
something..."

I was sure I'd heard something...

That time, I was sure it wasn't my imagination.


157 :
{1}

{T5B019}
{16:0x}I'm carving.{16:1}

{1}{1}



{T5B020}
{16:0x}Can't you see? I'm carving...{16:1}

{16:4}

158 :
(See, I really can hear something.)


159 :
{1}{1}{1}{1}




{T5B021}
{16:0x}I'm etching some marks into this stone statue.{16:1}

{16:4}

160 :
(...Stone statue?)


161 :
I looked around the four stone statues at the
edge of the open area.

And there...


162 :
Atop the pedestal of a stone statue was a girl.

She was standing next to the figure as
if clinging to it.

(Oh! It's that girl...)

It was the girl who I had seen and who had
then vanished on the first day.

[Kid]
Look, Y¤u! Right there!


163 :

{Y5A148}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
Look! Over on that statue!


{Y5A149}
[Y¤u]
What about the statue?

[Kid]
"Look! That stone statue! There's a girl 
there! See?"


164 :

{Y5A150}
[Y¤u]
Huh? I don't see anybody.

[Kid]
Not there! Over there!

[Kid]
Oh, forget it! I'll go call to her!


165 :

{Y5A151}
[Y¤u]
Kid!

I sprinted toward the stone statue.

(What could that girl be doing up there?)


{T5B023}
[???]
Well, it's because...


{T5B024}
[???]
I was feeling lonesome.

Lonesome?


{T5B025}
[???]
And anyway, I was...


{T5B026}
[???]
...Feeling sad...

Sad?

(What is she talking about?)


{T5B043}
[???]
Here we go, next...


{T5B044}
[???]
Uh-oh!

Just then, the girl lost her balance, falling
from her awkward place on the pedestal.


166 :
[Kid]
L-look out!


167 :
I ran toward her.

The water caught on my feet and sprayed
everywhere as I ran all out to where she was.

(Will I make it?)


168 :
I closed my eyes, mustered all of my power,
and sprinted.

I threw out my free left hand to where the
girl would be falling to catch her.


169 :
‡LSplash!

....

....

....

I didn't feel anything.

I thought maybe I hadn't reached her in time.

Scared, I opened my eyes.


170 :
(...What?)

There was no one in my arms.

Or even nearby.

Only the water sloshing about gently around me.


{Y5A152}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, are you alright? It looks like you took 
a pretty nasty spill..."

[Kid]
.........


171 :
I looked above me.

Of course, there was no one on the pedestal
supporting the statue.

Without saying anything, I got up and went
behind the statue.


172 :
There were scratches in the stone.

They looked like they had been deeply carved
there by something hard and sharp.


They were in the shape of people.

Really simple-looking, like stick people.

At the end of each stick was a little round
head...

There were six in all.

Looking more carefully, I could see two
unusual animal figures beside the human forms.



173 :
I looked up at the statue.

The statue was pointing diagonally upward...
to the east.


174 :

{Y5A153}
[Sara]
Hey, what are you two doing?


{Y5A154}
[Y¤u]
That's a good question...

I ignored them and gently touched the carvings
on the statue.

Without thinking, I blurted out...

[Kid]
Watch your step, okay?


175 :
{1}{1}{1}



{T5B048}
{16:0x}Okay~{16:1}

{16:4}

176 :
The answer could have been my imagination
that time...


177 :
Time passed...

We all split up and roamed around freely, doing
what we wanted to do.

Some wandered the complex, some tried to open
up communications with the outside, some tried
to think of ways to escape...

But no one gave up, and everyone was working on
ways to get out of our difficult situation.

But it was all in vain. We made no
breakthroughs...

The evening of the 5th rolled around.

{16:4}

178 :
I...

I wandered aimlessly around LeMU by myself.

Honestly, I hadn't been able to forget what
Sara had said to me the day before... or more
accurately, that morning.

I couldn't seem to clear my mind.

At breakfast, Sara was her same old self...


I thought that a little walk might make for a
change of mood...


179 :
The next thing that I knew, I was heading for
the Cosmic Whale...

I got into Ei.


180 :
I rode down to the third floor that was
flooded with water.

There was no guarantee that Sara would be
there...

I looked around, thinking.

...It was then that it happened.

I saw 'her' again!

[Kid]
Hey!

I saw her small figure cutting across the
corridor.

I was sure of it.

It was that girl!

I chased after her.


181 :
Her skirt shook back and forth as she walked
farther and farther away.

It was almost as if she was trying to get
away from me.

[Kid]
Hey! Wait a minute!

She might not have heard me, because she didn't
show any sign of stopping.

I wondered what it was all about.

The girl that kept appearing out of nowhere
and then disappearing.

The girl that didn't register on LeMMIH's
bio scan.

No, she had registered once...


182 :
‡L'Life readings: 7'


183 :
But the more I thought about it, the stranger
everything seemed.

She only appeared in front of me, and we hardly
communicated...

Well, I couldn't worry about it. I knew it
wouldn't help.

It was something that I could solve by asking
her directly.


184 :
She headed into the Cosmic Whale room.

I followed in soon after her.


185 :
I didn't see her anywhere.

Instead, I saw Sara sitting in the same place
we had sat earlier on the whale.

Sara was singing softly.


186 :

{S5A130}
[Sara]
Moon sprite shouldering a long bow.

{S5A131}
[Sara]
Waiting inside a dream.

{S5A132}
[Sara]
Tonight, a story by moonlight.

{S5A133}
[Sara]
Hoping the wait will be short.

{S5A134}
[Sara]
Sleeping curled and snug.

{S5A135}
[Sara]
Sleeping in mother's arms.

Her voice echoed quietly, as if it were seeping
into the night sky.

Somehow, it sounded faintly sad and lonely.

I couldn't make myself call out to Sara...


187 :
My eyes opened to the jarring sound of metal
screaming under strain.

I didn't know if it was because of my broken
arm or the swimming with Sara...

But I felt sluggish and feverish, so I took
some medicine and went to bed.

Vibrations shook through LeMU.

[Kid]
I wonder if something happened.


188 :
By the time I had gotten out of the infirmary,
the shaking had stopped.

I thought that if I went to the security
office I might learn what happened.


189 :
[Kid]
Tsugumi, what happened?


190 :

{S5A136}
[Tsugumi]
I don't know. I just got here myself.

Tsugumi said it coolly.

Then Sora appeared in the room.


191 :

{S5A137}
[Sora]
Komachi-san, Kid-san, so you two are here.

[Kid]
Sora, did something happen?


192 :

{S5A138}
[Sora]
Yes. Water breached the Cosmic Whale room...


{S5A139}
[Tsugumi]
Water breached it?


193 :

{S5A140}
[Sora]
"Yes. The room's wall collapsed under the 
water pressure and started flooding."

[Kid]
Are we... alright?


{S5A141}
[Sora]
"The doors to the Cosmic Whale have been 
sealed, so there will be no effect on other 
areas."

[Kid]
What about everyone else?


194 :

{S5A142}
[Sora]
"Tanaka-san and Kuranari-san are in the
control room."

[Kid]
Y¤u and Takeshi... What about Sara?


195 :

{S5A143}
[Sora]
"Matsunaga-san... Her last confirmed location is
in a corridor near the Cosmic Whale."


196 :
[Kid]
Corridor?


{S5A144}
[Sora]
"Sensors in that area are not functioning at 
full capacity... so I have not been able to 
verify this."


{S5A145}
[Sora]
Presently, it is completely cut off.

[Kid]
Where is Sara!?


197 :

{S5A146}
[Sora]
"I am unable to confirm her location 
anywhere in LeMU."

[Kid]
No way! Then she was in that room!


198 :
I couldn't stand staying in that room, so I ran
outside.

Tsugumi followed on my heels.


199 :
Tsugumi and I went down to the area housing
the Cosmic Whale room.

[Kid]
Sora, can you open the doors to the room?


200 :

{S5A147}
[Sora]
That is impossible.

[Kid]
But...


201 :

{S5A148}
[Sora]
"I am sorry... If I open these doors, 
this sector will flood as well."


{S5A149}
[Sora]
"If the generator room floods, then we will be 
powerless. I cannot do that."

[Kid]
What about Sara? Sara!


202 :

{S5A150}
[Tsugumi]
Calm down.

[Kid]
Tsugumi...


203 :

{S5A151}
[Tsugumi]
"Sora, are the emergency corridors around here 
still functioning? Is there any way to get to 
the room through them?"


204 :

{S5A152}
[Sora]
"I will check... Yes. There is a corridor 
directly above the Cosmic Whale."


205 :

{S5A153}
[Sora]
"However, it is not possible to reach the Cosmic 
Whale from there. That area is completely 
flooded."


{S5A154}
[Tsugumi]
But we could enter it by diving, right?


206 :

{S5A155}
[Sora]
Yes, but...

[Kid]
I'll go. We've got to save Sara!


207 :

{S5A156}
[Tsugumi]
With that broken arm? What're you gonna do?

[Kid]
B-but...


208 :

{S5A157}
[Tsugumi]
"You'll start drowning, and in the end I'll 
have to go save you too."

[Kid]
.........


209 :

{S5A158}
[Tsugumi]
I'll go.


210 :
[Kid]
But Tsugumi...


211 :

{S5A159}
[Tsugumi]
You're injured. So keep quiet.


212 :

{S5A160}
[Tsugumi]
"Sora, where is the nearest entrance to a 
corridor that'll get me there?"


213 :

{S5A161}
[Sora]
"Use the connecting staircase out of here and 
to the left."


214 :
Tsugumi started running before Sora was done
speaking.


215 :
I chased after Tsugumi.

[Kid]
Tsugumi, why...?


{S5A162}
[Tsugumi]
...There's no other choice.


{S5A163}
[Tsugumi]
We're in this... together.

[Kid]
Tsugumi...

Tsugumi sprinted to the emergency stairs and
climbed to the emergency corridor.

I followed right behind her.


216 :
When I got to the corridor, Tsugumi was
running for the Cosmic Whale room.

I hurriedly ran after her.


217 :
Tsugumi had turned the corner, already
opened the hatch to the room, and was
peering in.

[Kid]
Tsugumi! Wait!

Tsugumi glanced at me.


218 :

{S5A164}
[Tsugumi]
Wait here.


219 :
Saying that, Tsugumi leaped through the hatch.


[Kid]
Tsugumi!

[Kid]
Sora! Is Tsugumi okay?


{S5A165}
[Sora]
I don't know. Now we can only trust her and wait.

Only Sora's voice echoed around me.

She was speaking through a different set of
emergency speakers, and her voice crackled and
mixed with static.


{S5A166}
[Sora]
"Tanaka-san and Kuranari-san said that they will 
wait for you in the infirmary."

[Kid]
Okay...

I looked into the emergency hatch again.

Inside, the hatch was brimming with cold
water.

Frustrated and feeling powerless because
I could only wait, I tried to be patient.


[Kid]
Tsugumi, please... find Sara...

[Kid]
Sara...


220 :
Time passed.

It might not have really been that long.


But at that time, it felt like an eternity
to me.


221 :
Tsugumi came bursting out of the water.

She was carrying Sara on her back...

[Kid]
S-Sara!


{S5A167}
[Tsugumi]
*Pant*, *pant*... Let's get her out of the water.

[Kid]
Okay.

I forgot the pain in my arm and yanked Sara up.

Sara was like ice, cold and hard.

In her firmly clenched fist was the pendant.

Tsugumi put her hand on the back of her neck.


{S5A168}
[Tsugumi]
There's... no pulse.

[Kid]
No! Sara...

[Kid]
It can't be!

[Kid]
Sara! Sara! Wake up! Sara!

I shook Sara's cold body.

Tsugumi tried to calm me down and spoke.


{S5A169}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, let's get her to the infirmary.


222 :
We carried her to the infirmary and laid her
on an examination table.

Tsugumi immediately started giving her a heart
massage.

Takeshi and Y¤u were fiddling with the
machines around the examination table,
trying to learn more about Sara's status.

Takeshi got out the defibrillator.

A beep signaled that it was charged, and
Takeshi placed two pads on Sara's chest.


223 :
‡LWhaap.

Sara's body jumped.

Tsugumi put her hand on Sara's neck and shook
her head.

She went right back to massaging her heart.


{S5A170}
[Takeshi]
Damn. One more time.

The beep echoed again.

And then the electric pulse again.

Sara's face was drained of color, and her lips
were blue.

Her body was stiff and unresponsive.

All I could do was watch the three of them
busily work to save her.

There was nothing in the drawers of memory
accessible to me that told me how to act in
that situation.

Images of time I had spent with Sara up until then
flashed through my mind, and the voices in the
room barely reached me.

Finally... Tsugumi relaxed her hands.


With a look of grief, she moved away from Sara.

Takeshi also put the defibrillator back on the
table.


{S5A171}
[Y¤u]
No...


{S5A172}
[Takeshi]
Damn... Why...

[Kid]
What... happened?

[Kid]
Hey, why are you all stopping?

[Kid]
"Hey, why do you all have those looks on 
your faces?"


{S5A173}
[Y¤u]
...Kid...

[Kid]
It can't... be!

[Kid]
Sara! Sara!

[Kid]
Sara! Wake up! Wake up! Sara!

I started trying to copy Tsugumi's heart
massage.

The three of them watched with sad looks on
their faces.

[Kid]
Why... Why do you all want to give up?

[Kid]
Sara isn't going to die! She can't die here!

I continued to pump her chest frantically.


224 :
[Kid]
Sara!


225 :
[Kid]
Sara! Open your eyes!


226 :
[Kid]
Open your eyes!


227 :

{S5A174}
[Y¤u]
Kid...

Y¤u put her hand on my shoulder.

But I shook her hand off and continued pushing
on Sara's chest.


228 :
[Kid]
Don't die!

[Kid]
Open your eyes!


229 :
[Kid]
Saraaaaa!


230 :
{1}{1}{1}



{S5A175}
{16:0}Why do you care now?{16:1}

{S5A176}
{16:0}You were the one that ran away alone...{16:1}

231 :
I heard a voice.

[Kid]
No, I didn't run away!

[Kid]
I wanted to help you!

I put more power into the hand I was using to
push on her chest.

Her ribs bent under the strain.

Still, I kept pumping.

[Kid]
I told you, Sara!

[Kid]
Sara! I told you I would come... to help you!

[Kid]
I told you... I'd come to help you, didn't I?

I prayed for Sara's heart to start beating!

[Kid]
Sara!

[Kid]
You said you'd wait like a good girl...

[Kid]
You said you'd wait, didn't you?

I pushed a little harder.


232 :
‡LCough.

A little water came out of Sara's mouth.


{S5A177}
[Sara]
*Cough*...

She started breathing faintly, and more water
came out of her mouth.


{S5A178}
[Sara]
*Cough*, *cough*...

[Kid]
Sara! Sara!

I shook Sara desperately.


233 :

{S5A179}
[Sara]
Ugh... Ooooooh...

Sara's eyes opened slightly.

[Kid]
Oh, Sara!

That instant, the tension in the atmosphere of
the infirmary eased.


{S5A180}
[Sara]
Oh... Uh... I...

[Kid]
Oh, thank goodness... Sara... Sara...
