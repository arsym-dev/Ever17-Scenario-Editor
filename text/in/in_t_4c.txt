1 :
Several hours had passed since Sora's outburst.

Y¤u, £o¢o, and the Kid had finished their meal
and moved to the rest area, where they were
relaxing and letting their food digest.

[Takeshi]
Okay then...

I had almost finished tidying up the kiosk.

[Takeshi]
Heeheehee...!

I pulled out the object I had secretly hidden
behind the warmer.

Actually, there had been one sausage left at
the back of the refrigerator.

There were no hotdog buns,
so I stuffed the sausage into a bread roll.

I slapped on ketchup and mustard and took a
big bite.

[Takeshi]
Mmm... Mmm... This is so good...!

My mouth filled with the juicy flavor as I
bit down.

[Takeshi]
Mmmm... Meat... Mmm... Yum...

Fried tuna sandwiches were good, but not for
every meal every single day...

I hid in the back of the kiosk and devoured
the sausage.


2 :

{T4C000}
[Sora]
Oh, Kuranari-san, there you are.

[Takeshi]
Mmmf!?

Surprised by Sora's voice, I choked on a
piece of sausage.

Sora appeared in front of me.


3 :
[Takeshi]
......!? ......!


4 :

{T4C001}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san? Are you alright?

[Takeshi]
Aaaaaaaaagh!

[Takeshi]
A-ahgh... *cough*, *cough*...

Blinking and struggling, I finally managed to
swallow the chunk of meat.

I swallowed the rest of the sausage in one
bite to remove the evidence.


5 :
I struggled to control my breathing.

[Takeshi]
Sora...


6 :

{T4C002}
[Sora]
What is it?

[Takeshi]
Not a word about what you just saw, okay?


{T4C003}
[Sora]
Y-yes... Alright. I understand.


7 :

{T4C004}
[Sora]
"But what were you doing? Were you eating 
something?"

[Takeshi]
"Oh, well, if you don't know, it doesn't 
matter..."


{T4C005}
[Sora]
?

As usual, Sora feigned ignorance.

It looked like she didn't remember my love
psychology lecture.

It was just as well.


8 :

{T4C006}
[Sora]
By the way... I just had a talk with Komachi-san.

[Takeshi]
Oh, really?

Surprised, I blinked.

[Takeshi]
You spoke to Tsugumi?


{T4C007}
[Sora]
"Yes. She returned to the infirmary, so I 
went to see her."


{T4C008}
[Sora]
Komachi-san was actually the one to speak first.

[Takeshi]
Oh?


{T4C009}
[Sora]
"Yes, she said she was sorry for going too 
far and smashing the medical equipment."

[Takeshi]
A-apologized? Tsugumi!?


{T4C010}
[Sora]
Yes.

I was surprised.

No, I was really surprised.


9 :

{T4C011}
[Sora]
"And then she asked me a really strange 
question."

[Takeshi]
A strange question?

[Takeshi]
What'd she ask?


10 :

{T4C012}
[Sora]
Well...


11 :

{T4C013}
[Sora]
She said, 'What do you know about my past?'


12 :

{T4C014}
[Sora]
I didn't know what to say...

[Takeshi]
And?


13 :

{T4C015}
[Sora]
I told her I didn't know anything.


14 :

{T4C016}
[Sora]
...Because I didn't know anything.

[Takeshi]
Oh... Oh...

It WAS a strange question.

[Takeshi]
Where's Tsugumi now?

I said that, trying to restrain my sense of
urgency.


15 :

{T4C017}
[Sora]
She nodded at my answer and went to bed.

[Takeshi]
Bed?

[Takeshi]
"She went back to the infirmary and went to 
bed?"


{T4C018}
[Sora]
Well, yes.

[Takeshi]
Are you sure? Is that where she is now?


{T4C019}
[Sora]
Yes, probably.

[Takeshi]
Probably, huh...

[Takeshi]
"Can you check to make sure Tsugumi isn't 
wandering around instead of taking it easy?"


16 :
I nodded, but Sora looked troubled.

[Takeshi]
What's wrong? All it takes is a quick scan.


{T4C020}
[Sora]
Yes, well...


{T4C021}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san, I...


17 :

{T4C022}
[Sora]
"I don't like to scan with the sensors unless 
it's an emergency."

[Takeshi]
What?


{T4C023}
[Sora]
"There are times when even you want to be 
alone, right, Kuranari-san?"


{T4C024}
[Sora]
"And times when you want to talk about 
something secret or be alone with 
somebody...?"


{T4C025}
[Sora]
I want to protect people's privacy.


18 :

{T4C026}
[Sora]
If I scan, then I know everything.

Sora's smile was slightly uncomfortable.


19 :
Sora went to check on LeMMIH, and I went to
the second floor infirmary.


20 :
Several hours went by...

In the end, I hung around in LeMU by myself
and just killed some time.

I didn't see Tsugumi during that time...

I decided to have an early dinner.

Y¤u, £o¢o, and the Kid had finished their meal
and moved to the rest area, where they were
relaxing and letting their food digest.

[Takeshi]
Okay then...

I had almost finished tidying up the kiosk.

[Takeshi]
Heeheehee...!

I pulled out the object I had secretly hidden
behind the warmer.

Actually, there had been one sausage left at
the back of the refrigerator.

There were no hotdog buns,
so I stuffed the sausage into a bread roll.

I slapped on the ketchup and mustard and took
a big bite.

[Takeshi]
Mmm... Mmm... This is so good...!

My mouth filled with the juicy flavor as I
bit down.

[Takeshi]
Mmmm... Meat... Mmm... Yum...

Fried tuna sandwiches were good, but not for
every meal every single day...

I hid in the back of the kiosk and devoured
the sausage.


21 :

{T4C027}
[£o¢o]
Oh, Takepyon, there you are.

[Takeshi]
Mmmf!?

Surprised by £o¢o's voice, I choked on a
piece of sausage.

£o¢o appeared in front of me.


22 :
[Takeshi]
......!? ......!


23 :

{T4C028}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon? Are you alright?

[Takeshi]
Aaaaaaaaagh!

[Takeshi]
A-ahgh...*cough*, *cough*...

Blinking and struggling, I finally managed to
swallow the chunk of meat.

I swallowed the rest of the sausage in one
bite to remove the evidence.


24 :
I struggled to control my breathing.

[Takeshi]
£o¢o...


25 :

{T4C029}
[£o¢o]
What?

[Takeshi]
Not a word about what you just saw, okay?


26 :

{T4C030}
[£o¢o]
Um, okay sure, but...


{T4C031}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you didn't eat your sandwich 
before..."


27 :

{T4C032}
[£o¢o]
Oh, I see. You were saving it to eat later?

[Takeshi]
Ah, yeah. That's it.


{T4C033}
[£o¢o]
That was all? Oh, good~


{T4C034}
[£o¢o]
"I was worried about you. I thought you'd 
lost your appetite."

[Takeshi]
No, I'm fine. I ate.

I scratched my head.

(Sorry, £o¢o... I was selfishly eating a
sausage all by myself. Please forgive me...)

Inside, I apologized silently to her.


28 :

{T4C035}
[£o¢o]
Oh, that reminds me...


{T4C036}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon. Takepyon! I talked to Sora-san.


{T4C037}
[£o¢o]
"And guess what? Sora-san said she spoke to 
Tsugumin."

[Takeshi]
Oh, really?

Surprised, I blinked.

[Takeshi]
She spoke to Tsugumi?


29 :

{T4C038}
[£o¢o]
Yeah. When she went back to the infirmary.

[Takeshi]
Really...


{T4C039}
[£o¢o]
"And when Tsugumin ran into Sora-san in the 
infirmary."


30 :

{T4C040}
[£o¢o]
"She apologized for going all crazy and 
smashing the stuff. She even cleaned up the 
mess."

[Takeshi]
A-apologized? Tsugumi!?


{T4C041}
[£o¢o]
Yup. That's what I heard.

I was surprised.

No, I was really surprised.

[Takeshi]
What else? Did you hear anything else?


31 :

{T4C042}
[£o¢o]
Anything else? Umm... Well...


{T4C043}
[£o¢o]
"Sora-san said Tsugumin was asking questions and 
stuff."

[Takeshi]
Asking questions?


32 :

{T4C044}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, she asked her a really silly question.

[Takeshi]
A strange... question?

[Takeshi]
What'd she ask?


33 :

{T4C045}
[£o¢o]
Um, what was it...? Oh, yeah!


34 :

{T4C046}
[£o¢o]
She said, 'What do you know about my past?'


35 :

{T4C047}
[£o¢o]
Or something like that...

[Takeshi]
And?


36 :

{T4C048}
[£o¢o]
Sora-san said she didn't know anything.


{T4C049}
[£o¢o]
I guess Tsugumin was satisfied.

[Takeshi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
Is that it?


37 :

{T4C050}
[£o¢o]
Yup, that's it.

[Takeshi]
Oh.


{T4C051}
[£o¢o]
"Come to think about it, that is kind of a 
silly question."

Yes... It was very weird.

[Takeshi]
£o¢o, where's Tsugumi now?

I said that, trying to restrain my sense of
urgency.


38 :

{T4C052}
[£o¢o]
I think she's still in the infirmary.


{T4C053}
[£o¢o]
"She went to bed. At least that's what Sora-san
said."

[Takeshi]
Bed?

[Takeshi]
"She went back to the infirmary and went to 
bed?"


{T4C054}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, I think.

[Takeshi]
Are you sure? Is that where she is now?


39 :

{T4C055}
[£o¢o]
Uuum, probably.

[Takeshi]
Probably, huh...

[Takeshi]
"Alright then. I think I'll go and check 
on her."


40 :
[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
"What is it? What, £o¢o? Is there something 
on my face?"

For some reason, £o¢o was staring at my face.


41 :
She laughed quietly.


{T4C056}
[£o¢o]
You like Tsugumin, don't you?

[Takeshi]
...Huh?

[Takeshi]
Y-you gotta be kidding me! There's no way!


{T4C057}
[£o¢o]
Really? I wonder?


42 :

{T4C058}
[£o¢o]
"It seems to me like it's written aaAAaall 
over your face."

[Takeshi]
Huh!?

Flustered, I rubbed at my face.

Nothing came off on my hands.

At least nobody had been writing on my face
again...


43 :
£o¢o, watching me, had a smile as bright as
the sun.


44 :
I left £o¢o and went to the second floor
infirmary.


45 :
I hope she's resting properly...


46 :
[Takeshi]
Heeey, Tsugumi, can I come in?

I spoke into the intercom and opened the door.


47 :
The infirmary was quiet again.

All the smashed equipment had been tidied up.


Sure enough...


48 :
Tsugumi was there.

[Takeshi]
Oh, you really are in bed!

[Takeshi]
I don't believe it!


49 :
Perhaps sensing my presence, Tsugumi opened
her eyes.


{T4C059}
[Tsugumi]
What? Could you keep it down...?

Her voice was normal.


{T4C060}
[Tsugumi]
Am I not supposed to be here or something?

[Takeshi]
No! No, not at all!

[Takeshi]
I was just surprised, that's all.


50 :

{T4C061}
[Tsugumi]
Surprised?

[Takeshi]
Um, yeah, surprised...

[Takeshi]
You came back.


{T4C062}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... Well...


{T4C063}
[Tsugumi]
"I had to come back from that sector. There 
was nowhere to go."

[Takeshi]
"Hey, that's not what I... Ah, no, never 
mind."

[Takeshi]
Anyway, I'm glad you're back.


{T4C064}
[Tsugumi]
Glad...?

[Takeshi]
Yeah. Glad. Relieved?


{T4C065}
[Tsugumi]
...Oh really.

Tsugumi looked at me intently.


51 :
As she spoke, she lay back down and slowly
closed her eyes.


52 :

{T4C066}
[Tsugumi]
Keep your voice down, okay?


{T4C067}
[Tsugumi]
My head hurts a little. Noise makes it worse.

[Takeshi]
Oh? Yeah, I'm sorry.

[Takeshi]
Hey, you hungry?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
You want me to make you a sandwich?

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T4C068}
[Tsugumi]
Yes, please...

[Takeshi]
Okay. I'll go get you one.

[Takeshi]
"Wait right here. I'll be back soon, okay? So 
don't move."

I tried not to make any noise as I left.


53 :
As soon as I got out of the infirmary I
sprinted to the third floor.


54 :
The kiosk had been cleaned up, but I turned
the fryer back on and heated up the tuna.

I hurried, but worked carefully.

I heated the bread and browned it slightly.

I spread on the special sauce and chose the
best piece of lettuce.

Hurriedly wrapping the hot sandwich, I left
the kiosk.


55 :
I sprinted back to the infirmary. I had been
away less than ten minutes.

She was probably sick of waiting.


56 :
I punched the open button until the door
opened.


57 :
[Takeshi]
Sorry I took so long...

I called out softly as I approached the quiet
bed.

[Takeshi]
"I took more trouble with this than usual. 
It's a masterpiece."

[Takeshi]
Eat it before it gets cold...

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Maybe she was asleep.

I approached the bed, but there was no answer.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumiiii...

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, here's your food...

[Takeshi]
"A delicious sandwich, get it while it's 
hot..."

I called softly, but there was no response.

[Takeshi]
TSUGUMI!

I tried yelling.

[Takeshi]
I said HERE'S YOUR FOOD!

[Takeshi]
Are you going to eat it? Say something!

[Takeshi]
.........


58 :
GRAB!!

I pulled back the blanket on the bed.


59 :
Tsugumi wasn't there.

The bed was still slightly warm...

[Takeshi]
She's gone!

[Takeshi]
I told her not to move!

I let out a deep sigh.

I held my head in my hands.

I resisted the urge to throw the sandwich
against the wall.

[Takeshi]
"Where on earth did that stupid girl run off 
to...?"

Without thinking about it, I stamped my foot.


60 :
Crunch!

I felt something hard under my shoe.


[Takeshi]
Huh...?

I lifted my foot and looked down.

Whatever I had stepped on was pulverized
under my feet.

The small pieces smelled faintly.

I bent down and spread them out on my hand.

[Takeshi]
...Looks like nuts...

Glancing under the bed, I found a rolled-up
sheet stuffed underneath.

I pulled it out.

I found a bag, which had probably contained
the nuts, and an empty box.

They looked like souvenirs bought at some shop.


(Were these here when we searched the place?)

Had Tsugumi smuggled them in?

(Was she eating them in secret...?)

No, that explanation didn't feel quite right.

(Ah...)

I thought the nuts were crushed because I had
stepped on them...

But there was also a large amount of powder
under the bed. Someone had deliberately
crushed the nuts.

I pulled the box out from under the bed and
glanced inside.

A section of the lid had been torn off.
The box was filled with cotton, with a soft
hollow in the center.

It looked like the nest of some small animal.


61 :
[Takeshi]
Hmmmm...

I considered the evidence..

The cotton in the box and the scattered
pieces of nut...

(Did Tsugumi have some kind of pet?)

It seemed like a reasonable conclusion.

In that case...

[Takeshi]
Maybe she's gone looking for her pet?

But where exactly?

[Takeshi]
I couldn't ask Sora...


62 :
I called Sora from the infirmary terminal,
but she didn't appear.


63 :
[Takeshi]
Maybe...!?

Once I thought about it, I remembered
having seen a rat running out of the infirmary.

(So was Tsugumi keeping a rat in here...?)


The evidence would seem to point to that.

In that case...

[Takeshi]
Has she gone looking for her pet?

But where exactly?

[Takeshi]
Maybe I should ask Sora.


64 :
I called Sora from the infirmary terminal.

But she didn't appear.

[Takeshi]
Huh? Is this broken?


65 :
I looked at the map of LeMU on the monitor,
but I could detect no signs of life.

Was there anywhere nearby that could operate
LeMMIH with a large terminal?

[Takeshi]
Of course... the security office!

If I went there, I would probably learn
something.


66 :
I left the infirmary and turned left down a
corridor.


67 :
When I arrived at the security office, I
opened the door and flew inside.


68 :
There was somebody already there.


69 :
Tsugumi was sitting in a chair in front of the
console.

She was engrossed in something and didn't
notice me come in.


70 :
She was doing something at the console.

On the screen was a zoomed-in section of a map.

A strange point of light was moving across the
enlarged section of the map.

The light indicated a sign of life.


71 :
She hit the key.

One portion of the screen changed, and the
remote camera zoomed in on whatever was
reacting.

A living creature was visible on the monitor.


{T4C069}
[Tsugumi]
Phew...

Tsugumi breathed a sigh of relief.

[Takeshi]
A rat.


72 :
At the sound of my whisper, Tsugumi swung
around.

She blinked.

[Takeshi]
It's a rat, isn't it?

[Tsugumi]
..........

A grey rat was running along a pipe.

The map showed the isolated sector on the
third floor.

[Takeshi]
Is it that rat you're looking for?


73 :

{T4C070}
[Tsugumi]
...O-of course not!

Tsugumi was obviously flustered.

[Takeshi]
I looked under your bed and saw the box.

[Takeshi]
There were nuts everywhere...


74 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

She looked away.

[Takeshi]
"You don't have to answer if you don't want 
to."

[Takeshi]
"Anyway, I wonder how that dirty rodent got 
here?"


75 :

{T4C071}
[Tsugumi]
DIRTY RODENT!?

Tsugumi's voice was suddenly hysterical.

I was a little taken aback.

[Takeshi]
It's not a rat?


76 :

{T4C072}
[Tsugumi]
It's a Djungarian hamster!


77 :

{T4C073}
[Tsugumi]
...I think...

[Takeshi]
Reeeally...

[Takeshi]
"Oh, so that's what it's called, a Djungarian, 
huh...?"

[Takeshi]
You're pretty knowledgeable, Tsugumi.


78 :

{T4C074}
[Tsugumi]
...E-everybody knows what they're called...

Her chest puffed out slightly.

[Takeshi]
So you were looking for that rat?


79 :

{T4C075}
[Tsugumi]
No!


{T4C076}
[Tsugumi]
I told you it's not a rat!

[Takeshi]
Oh, sorry, uh, not rat, but hamster.


80 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
You were looking for the hamster?


81 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi seemed to nod her head, reluctantly.

The movement was so small I wasn't even sure
if she had made it.


82 :
Tsugumi looked back at the monitor.


{T4C077}
[Tsugumi]
He probably traveled through some pipe.

[Takeshi]
Pipe?


{T4C078}
[Tsugumi]
"The pipes with the electric cables or the 
power sockets."

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.


83 :
Her finger traced the map.

Nobody could walk to where the hamster was.


The top right of the screen showed an area
underwater. It seemed there was one room
still empty.

It was even farther away than the isolated
area on the third floor.

It wasn't very clear on the map, but there
was one emergency corridor in the sector.

(Hmmmm...)


84 :
I committed LeMU's map to memory...

[Takeshi]
Geez. I guess I'll just have to...

I grabbed a plastic bag from the trash can and
headed for the exit.


85 :

{T4C079}
[Tsugumi]
Where do you think you're going?

[Takeshi]
"Where do you think I'm going? I'm going to 
go get him."


{T4C080}
[Tsugumi]
Who?

[Takeshi]
That funny-looking hamster.


86 :

{T4C081}
[Tsugumi]
There's no way you'll make it!


{T4C082}
[Tsugumi]
"There's a section underwater between here and
there!"



{T4C083}
[Tsugumi]
And no human could fit through the pipe!

I ignored her and left the security office.


87 :
I began to walk toward the place I had in mind.


88 :

{T4C084}
[Tsugumi]
Wait!

Tsugumi caught up with me and grabbed my arm.

[Takeshi]
What now?

[Takeshi]
"If I don't get going, Hammy is going 
to move to another place."


89 :

{T4C085}
[Tsugumi]
How do you plan to get in there?

[Takeshi]
How else...? Swim.


90 :

{T4C086}
[Tsugumi]
Huh!?

Tsugumi's hand relaxed.


91 :
Still in her grip, I kept moving.

Tsugumi came with me.


92 :

{T4C087}
[Tsugumi]
W-wait!


{T4C088}
[Tsugumi]
Are you out of your mind?

[Takeshi]
I'm going through with this.


93 :

{T4C089}
[Tsugumi]
That's the reason why I think you're stupid.


{T4C090}
[Tsugumi]
"If you open those floodgates, you'll be 
overwhelmed by the seawater‡Lthe pressure is 
six atmospheres!"

[Takeshi]
You don't have to worry about that.


94 :
[Takeshi]
"Hammy's in an area directly connected 
to the flooded emergency corridor."

[Takeshi]
"The water in that area is one atmosphere of 
pressure, so the flooded corridor should be 
about the same."

[Takeshi]
"Besides, the floodgates on either side of 
the corridor are firmly shut."

[Takeshi]
"That corridor is completely isolated from the 
outside seawater."


95 :
[Takeshi]
The entrance on the other side is open.

[Takeshi]
"If I use the flooded corridor beneath the 
room, I can get into the next area..."

[Takeshi]
Why don't you go back and check the map?


96 :

{T4C091}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{T4C092}
[Tsugumi]
"How far do you think it is to get to the 
area?"

[Takeshi]
51 meters.

[Takeshi]
I made sure to check it before.


97 :

{T4C093}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, but 51 meters is a long way...

[Takeshi]
It'll be alright.

[Takeshi]
"Actually, I swam down and back in a 25-meter 
pool once."

[Takeshi]
"I kicked off the far wall coming back, but 
still..."

I mimed swimming as I spoke. Tsugumi's
expression hardened.


98 :

{T4C094}
[Tsugumi]
You...


{T4C095}
[Tsugumi]
You are crazy.


99 :

{T4C096}
[Tsugumi]
Are you trying to kill yourself?


100 :
Tsugumi breathed in sharply.

[Takeshi]
I'll be alright.

[Takeshi]
"It's alright, I won't die. I promise I'll 
come back."


101 :

{T4C097}
[Tsugumi]
Why are you doing this?


{T4C098}
[Tsugumi]
"Why are you doing this for one little 
hamster?"

[Takeshi]
What else can I do?

[Takeshi]
We're all in this together.


102 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Maybe you're not one of us...

[Takeshi]
But any pet you have is one of us.

[Takeshi]
"In Japan, people with the same goal are 
called friends..."


103 :

{T4C099}
[Tsugumi]
...You're an idiot.

[Takeshi]
That doesn't bother me.

[Takeshi]
"I'd rather be a cheerful idiot than some 
warped genius."


104 :
We took Ei down to the third floor.

From there, we walked along the corridor to the
isolated sector.


105 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Anyway, you may as well eat this.

The fried tuna sandwich was still in my
hand. I shoved it at Tsugumi.

[Takeshi]
Here, before it gets cold.


106 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi's face showed no reaction as she
silently accepted the sandwich.

Tsugumi slowly unwrapped the sandwich.

She cautiously sniffed it.


107 :

{T4C100}
[Tsugumi]
*MUNCH*

Tsugumi suddenly took a huge bite.


108 :

{T4C101}
[Tsugumi]
Mmm...


109 :

{T4C102}
[Tsugumi]
Mmmff... nnn...

She ate it fast.

The sandwich disappeared before my eyes.


110 :

{T4C103}
[Tsugumi]
...Whew.

[Takeshi]
How was it? Good, huh?


111 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi didn't reply, but balled up the
sandwich wrapping paper and threw it back at
me.

But seeing how happily she ate, I didn't need
words to know how she felt.

I was pleased.


112 :
We arrived at the pipe room.


113 :
We searched the floor and opened the hatch of
the manhole that led to the emergency corridor.

We peered inside.


114 :
A tube of about 70 centimeters in diameter
stretched down below us.

A simple ladder was fixed on one side of the
tube. About two meters down, we could see the
submerged emergency light shining.

We could find no signs that the water was
backflowing as we peered through the hatch.

That meant that the water pressure inside the
corridor was balanced against the pressure
around us.

[Takeshi]
"I wonder if there's something I can use to 
guide me back?"

Fortunately, there was a rope with a hook on
it which looked as if it was a lifeline for
the maintenance crew. I decided to hold onto
it when I went in.

Checking that the rope was long enough, I
firmly tied it to a pipe nearby.

If I tied it to the hook where I came out,
then it should be easy to return.

[Takeshi]
Alright then...

I did some light stretching exercises to warm
up.


115 :

{T4C104}
[Tsugumi]
Wait!


116 :

{T4C105}
[Tsugumi]
I should... go instead.

[Takeshi]
Huh?

Tsugumi stared me square in the face.


117 :

{T4C106}
[Tsugumi]
Don't get me wrong.


{T4C107}
[Tsugumi]
"I just don't want to watch you pull this 
hypocritical stunt, that's all."


{T4C108}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't want to see you kill yourself 
because you believe this hypocrisy."

[Takeshi]
How can you say that?

[Takeshi]
That's not a nice thing to say!

I laughed at her as I loosened my limbs and
body.


118 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"I'll be fine. You go back to the security 
office."


{T4C109}
[Tsugumi]
What?

[Takeshi]
"When I get through to the other side, you 
can tell me where Hammy is."

[Takeshi]
"We won't be able to locate him without 
LeMMIH, will we?"

[Takeshi]
"So unless someone who can operate LeMMIH 
stays behind, it won't work."


119 :

{T4C110}
[Tsugumi]
But...

[Takeshi]
Okay then. It's settled.

I finished warming up and adjusted the voice
converter in my ear.

Sora had told me that the earphone was
pressure-resistant but hadn't said anything
about whether it was waterproof.

[Takeshi]
See you later!


120 :
I ruffled Tsugumi's hair and started to climb
down the ladder.


121 :
My toes reached the bottom of the ladder.

I let go of the ladder and leaped into the
emergency corridor.

{16:4}

122 :
(Wow, it's COLD...!)

It was like swimming in ice water.

The water there was much colder than the water
higher up.

I had greatly miscalculated.

{16:4}

123 :
And that wasn't the only thing I'd
miscalculated.

The corridor was pitch black inside.

I tried to use my PDA backlight.

I could see that there were parallel walls on
either side and that part of the corridor was
straight.

But that was all I could see. I knew nothing
of what was beyond that.

{16:4}

124 :
At that point, my PDA batteries ran out.


(Oh, crap... No using this for a while...)

There was nothing for it but to grope my way
forward.

How far had I swum? How much farther did I
need to go?

I had no way of guessing.

I didn't even know if I was swimming in the
right direction.

{16:4}

125 :
I just kept swimming in the darkness.

It was terrifying.

As my breath got tighter, I could feel the
fear spreading through my body.

(I might just die here.)

As afraid as I was, I was able to consider
dying quite calmly.

I was caught in the illusion that I was
sinking farther and farther down.

{16:4}

126 :
The darkness penetrated to my very core.

The shadow of death crept through my whole
body...

Eroding my every cell...

{16:4}

127 :
(I can't... last... much longer...)


128 :
Just as my fear reached its peak, I glimpsed
a spot of light.

The exit!

Was it 10 meters? Or 20, maybe?

My vision was cloudy, and I couldn't judge the
distance.

I was reaching my limit. No, I had probably
already exceeded it.

{16:4}

129 :
The light was shining beyond the darkness.

My body was screaming as my cramping fingers
stretched out to the light.

A little farther, just a little farther, the
light was right...


130 :
‡LThwump!

My hand grabbed the ladder.

I wasted no time in fixing the rope on the
hook.

I pulled myself upward.

{16:4}

131 :
I scaled the ladder as quickly as I could
and burst out into the corridor.

[Takeshi]
Ggga... ha... nnggaah!

I breathed deeply, in and out.

I coughed and spat.

I felt like I was going to cough the darkness
right out of my lungs.

[Takeshi]
Uh... ugh...


132 :
But contrary to my expectations...

[Takeshi]
...Gagh...


133 :
What erupted from my mouth were
the semi-liquid remains of my hotdog.


134 :
I was a little cold, but I shook my head to
clear it and continued my search for Hammy.


The floodgates on either side of the
corridor were shut tight.

There was only one other door.

I went through.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Hammy!

That probably wasn't its name, but never
mind...

It was better than yelling 'Djungariaaan!'


{T4C111}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, are you alright?

I heard Tsugumi's voice come out through a
speaker somewhere in the room.


{T4C112}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm picking up your sound on the monitor. If 
you can hear me, answer."

[Takeshi]
Okay, Tsugumi, I can hear you.


{T4C113}
[Tsugumi]
What can you see?

[Takeshi]
"The room is pitch black. I can't see a thing. 
Either the lights are broken, or there's not 
enough power."

[Takeshi]
My trusty PDA is out of power...

[Takeshi]
I should have brought some fireflies with me.


{T4C114}
[Tsugumi]
Did you say something?

[Takeshi]
"Nothing. If you pick up Hammy's 
location, let me know."


{T4C115}
[Tsugumi]
Okay...


{T4C116}
[Tsugumi]
Go straight ahead, about three meters.

[Takeshi]
1, 2, 3... Okay!


{T4C117}
[Tsugumi]
Turn right 40 degrees.

[Takeshi]
40 degrees? What kind of angle is THAT?


{T4C118}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, you just turned left, not right!

[Takeshi]
Are you sure? The other way?


{T4C119}
[Tsugumi]
Are you sure you're okay?

[Takeshi]
"It was just the wrong direction. I'm fine. 
Look, I'm facing the right direction now."


{T4C120}
[Tsugumi]
Oooh...!


{T4C121}
[Tsugumi]
"Go straight ahead another four meters... There's 
a step there, be careful."

[Takeshi]
"What? How can I be careful in the dark...!? 
Wagh!"


135 :
[Takeshi]
........


{T4C122}
[Tsugumi]
What happened?


{T4C123}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi? Takeshi? Are you alright?


{T4C124}
[Tsugumi]
Hey! Talk to me! Takeshi!


{T4C125}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi?

[Takeshi]
Uh...

[Takeshi]
It's alright, I'm alive.

[Takeshi]
"Can you let me know how high the steps are 
going to be? I didn't realize I'd be smashing 
my knee against it."


{T4C126}
[Tsugumi]
...I'm sorry.

[Takeshi]
"Okay, okay, go on. Is Hammy still 
here? He hasn't run away?"


{T4C127}
[Tsugumi]
He's still there.

[Takeshi]
Okay, navigate me.


{T4C128}
[Tsugumi]
Alright.

On I went like that...

[Takeshi]
Alright, I've got you!

I successfully trapped the hamster in the
plastic bag.

[Takeshi]
"I'm on my way back. Wait for me in the pipe 
room."


{T4C129}
[Tsugumi]
Alright.


136 :
I went out into the light of the corridor and
checked the hamster.

Okay. He was quiet, but seemed healthy.


I blew more air into the bag and tied the
mouth of it shut tight.

Tired as I was, could I get back the way I
had come?

I hesitated, but unless I went back, it was all
pointless.

If I followed the rope, I would be able to
get back faster than I had come.

I tied the bag to my waist, took a deep
breath, and jumped into the water.


137 :
[Takeshi]
Faagh!?


138 :
I climbed up the pipe ladder and stuck my
head out of the hatch.

I had made it back safely to the area I had
started from.

[Takeshi]
Honey, I'm hooome!


139 :
Tsugumi was waiting beside the hatch.

[Takeshi]
"Look what the cat dragged in... me. Well, 
here I am. I'm back."


140 :

{T4C130}
[Tsugumi]
W-welcome back..


141 :
I closed the hatch and stood up.

I opened the plastic bag at my waist and
took out the hamster.


142 :

{T4C131}
[Tsugumi]
Ah...

Tsugumi grabbed the hamster.

Lovingly, she stroked his damp fur.


{T4C132}
[Tsugumi]
Thank you...

Tsugumi whispered her gratitude without
looking at me.

[Takeshi]
What's his real name?

I looked at the hamster.


{T4C133}
[Tsugumi]
...Now, don't laugh?

[Takeshi]
Okay. I won't.


{T4C134}
[Tsugumi]
You promise?

[Takeshi]
I promise.


{T4C135}
[Tsugumi]
His name's Chami.


{T4C136}
[Tsugumi]
Chami. Because he's charming.

.........

Chami.

[Takeshi]
That's cute. What a good name!

How... cute.

That was what I thought.

I did my best to stifle my laughter.


143 :

{T4C137}
[Tsugumi]
Hey! You promised not to laugh!

[Takeshi]
I'm not laughing!

I tried to keep a straight face...

But the corners of my mouth started to twitch.

Chami.

Charming Chami. Well...

'Chami-chan, Chami-chan, it's din-din time.'

I could just imagine Tsugumi baby-talking to
it.

[Takeshi]
Chami-chan, Chami-chan...

[Takeshi]
Mffff, hahaha...


{T4C138}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaaaah...!


{T4C139}
[Tsugumi]
That's why I didn't want to tell you!

Sullen, Tsugumi was red-faced...

...But she held out the bath towel she had
behind her back.

[Takeshi]
Oh, thanks!

I took the towel and wiped myself down.

[Takeshi]
Phew...

I breathed deeply, feeling reborn, as I
glanced at Tsugumi's profile.


144 :
She was playing with the hamster in her hand,
and her cheeks were bright.

She looked so happy...

It was the first time I'd ever seen her smile
like she meant it.

145 :

{T4C140}
[Tsugumi]
Don't get me wrong.


{T4C141}
[Tsugumi]
"I didn't purposely try to get you to do 
something that I knew you couldn't do."


146 :

{T4C142}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not like you. I'm not stupid.


147 :

{T4C143}
[Tsugumi]
You and I are different up here.

Tsugumi tapped her head.


148 :

{T4C144}
[Tsugumi]
I'm going.

[Takeshi]
"What's your problem? I can't believe you're 
being like that at a time like this..."

[Takeshi]
That's not a nice thing to say!

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"I'll be fine. You go back to the security 
office."

[Takeshi]
"When I get through to the other side, you 
can tell me where Hammy is."

[Takeshi]
"We won't be able to locate him without 
LeMMIH, will we?"


149 :

{T3A107}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm, yeah...

[Takeshi]
"Hmmm, yeah, is it? Why don't you use that 
superior intellect of yours to think of 
something?"

[Takeshi]
"Unless someone who can operate LeMMIH stays 
behind, it won't work."


150 :

{T4C146}
[Tsugumi]
Hahaha...

Tsugumi laughed.


{T4C147}
[Tsugumi]
It's no problem.


{T4C148}
[Tsugumi]
"I've learned from you. I'll show you what I 
can do with a little courage and guts."

[Takeshi]
Now, wait just a‡L


151 :
Ooomph!

[Takeshi]
Ugh!

She punched me.

Tsugumi punched me.

[Takeshi]
‡L‡L‡L‡L!?


152 :

{T4C149}
[Tsugumi]
See you later...

Tsugumi took the rope hook and went down the
ladder.


153 :
Before long, she disappeared from view.

The rope stretched into the water.

Holding my stomach, I sunk to my knees.

She'd got me with a solid body blow and I
couldn't stand up.

She really hit hard.

(I can't believe her...)

I seemed to remember getting punched like
that... by someone wearing a mascot costume...

(Was that Tsugumi...!? Ughg...)


154 :
I was suddenly dizzy.

My stomach was in agony.

Not where I'd been punched...

I was suffering from a totally different pain.

I reached for the pipe and tried to stand up.

But my hand grasped at thin air.

My vision clouded.

I coughed and spat.


155 :
[Takeshi]
...Gagh...


156 :
What erupted from my mouth were
the semi-liquid remains of my hotdog.

(Wha-what the...?)

I felt a chill as I lost consciousness...


157 :
When I regained consciousness, I was lying
half in a pool of water.

(Where am I...?)


158 :
(Oh, it's the pipe room...)

(What happened to Tsugumi...?)

In front of me, I could see the rope
disappearing into the hatch.

[Takeshi]
That's right! She's looking for Hammy!

[Takeshi]
"I have to get to the security office! 
Tsugumi will need navigation!"


159 :

{T4C150}
[Tsugumi]
...You're too late.

[Takeshi]
Sorry, I'll be right there!

[Takeshi]
...Huh? What?


160 :

{T4C151}
[Tsugumi]
I've already been there and back.

With a startled look on her face, Tsugumi
peered out of the hatch.


161 :
She pulled up the rope as she stood up and
closed the hatch.

I slowly got off the floor.

[Takeshi]
Ho-how'd it go, Tsugumi?


162 :

{T4C152}
[Tsugumi]
"I found him. He was in the corner of the 
room. But I couldn't catch him."


{T4C153}
[Tsugumi]
I think he ran this way.

[Takeshi]
Oh...

I hoped we could catch him.

[Takeshi]
Just let me check then...

[Takeshi]
What does this hamster look like?


163 :

{T4C154}
[Tsugumi]
He's just a normal Djungarian.


{T4C155}
[Tsugumi]
"Gray color, black stripe on his back, small
enough to sit in the palm of your hand..."


[Takeshi]
Hmmmm...

[Takeshi]
Like that?

I pointed at a small rodent running along a
nearby pipe.


164 :

{T4C156}
[Tsugumi]
...Huh?


{T4C157}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


165 :

{T4C158}
[Tsugumi]
...Grab him!

[Takeshi]
What?

Seeing the rodent, Tsugumi's eyes got huge.

I had no idea what to say.

The small furry animal noticed Tsugumi and me
and froze, his eyes fixed on us.

[Takeshi]
Well then.

I reached out my hand.

Gotcha.

(What? Just like that?)

I didn't think I'd catch him so quickly.

The stunned hamster lay quietly in my hand.

[Takeshi]
Woah! Nice catch!


166 :

{T4C159}
[Tsugumi]
Aaagh!


167 :

{T4C160}
[Tsugumi]
No! Be careful! Don't squeeze him so hard!

[Takeshi]
What?


168 :
Tsugumi snatched the 'rat' from my hand.

She stroked it gently as if she was
consoling it.


169 :

{T4C161}
[Tsugumi]
Did it hurt? I'm sorry...

[Takeshi]
Huh? What?

[Takeshi]
"Is that really a rat? I mean, what are you 
doing with that thing in the first place!?"

I was taken aback.


170 :

{T4C162}
[Tsugumi]
No!


{T4C163}
[Tsugumi]
I keep telling you!


171 :

{T4C164}
[Tsugumi]
This is not a rat, it's Chami!


{T4C165}
[Tsugumi]
He's a Djungarian hamster!

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi spat the words out. She pouted as she
glared at me.

[Takeshi]
Okay, he's not a rat, he's Chami...

[Takeshi]
...Chami?

[Takeshi]
That hamster's name is Chami?


172 :

{T4C166}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't say that.


173 :

{T4C167}
[Tsugumi]
I never said that...

Embarrassed, she bowed her head.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
I, uh...

[Takeshi]
Anyway, that's what you were looking for?


174 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

She nodded silently.

[Takeshi]
Okay, well, great...

[Takeshi]
That was lucky, wasn't it!

[Takeshi]
Anyway, we've caught him.


{T4C168}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... Ah... Um...


175 :

{T4C169}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, I... Thank you... I guess.

Her voice was quiet and expressionless.


176 :
[Takeshi]
Ouch!


177 :
She knocked me down and bolted from the room.


She was soaking wet and still clutching Chami.


178 :
(What is with that chick...?)

I had wanted to tell her how glad I was that
she was okay.

It seemed I had missed my chance.

Stunned, I listened to her footsteps grow
fainter.


179 :
[Takeshi]
...So that's what happened.


180 :

{T4C170}
[Sora]
Oh, I see...

Several hours had elapsed since the hunt for
Chami.

I had asked to Sora to come with me to the
souvenir kiosk on the second floor.


181 :

{T4C171}
[Sora]
Isn't it great that Komachi-san found her friend?

[Takeshi]
Ahh, yeah.

Her friend, huh... Well, as far as Tsugumi
was concerned, it was her friend.


{T4C172}
[Sora]
Anyway, Kuranari-san...


{T4C173}
[Sora]
"Weren't we going to search this kiosk for 
food?"

[Takeshi]
Uh, was that right?


182 :
It was quiet all around.

There was no one around.

Y¤u, the Kid, and £o¢o were in the conference
room, preparing for bed.

Tsugumi was probably asleep in the infirmary.

[Takeshi]
"We looked pretty thoroughly last time and 
didn't find anything..."


183 :

{T4C174}
[Sora]
"But there are nuts and cookies here. I saw 
them right away, look."

Sora pointed to the packets in the kiosk.

[Takeshi]
Oh, really?

There was a mountain of packets just like the
one I had found under the bed in the infirmary.


[Takeshi]
"I guess we were all half-asleep when we 
looked last time."

[Takeshi]
"Well, we don't need to worry about food for 
the time being."


184 :

{T4C175}
[Sora]
"You can all keep eating the fried tuna
sandwiches, can't you?"

[Takeshi]
"Yes, there are plenty. I don't know what the 
expiration date on them is, but there should 
be enough for two or three more days."


{T4C176}
[Sora]
Oh...

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

We kept talking for a while.

It was an ordinary conversation with no fixed
theme and nothing to do with the topic of
escape.

[Takeshi]
I wonder what the weather is like up there...


185 :

{T4C177}
[Sora]
"I have no way of knowing what the 
situation's like up on the surface..."


{T4C178}
[Sora]
"...But judging from what it's like 
underwater, it's quite calm. It's unlikely to 
get worse any time soon."

[Takeshi]
That's reassuring...


186 :

{T4C179}
[Sora]
Yes...


187 :
Half the meaning was probably lost.

I thought that perhaps that conversation
could be an opportunity.

I searched for the right words.


188 :
[Takeshi]
Listen, Sora.

[Takeshi]
I want to talk about something serious.


189 :

{T4C180}
[Sora]
You do too, Kuranari-san?


190 :

{T4C181}
[Sora]
Actually... so do I.

[Takeshi]
R-really?

[Takeshi]
Okay, after you... Ladies first.


{T4C182}
[Sora]
No, Kuranari-san, you go first.

[Takeshi]
"To tell you the truth, I'm a little 
embarrassed."


191 :

{T4C183}
[Sora]
So am I...

192 :
{11:0-c4}
{11:1}Okay, me first

{11:1}Sora first

{11:1}Both at the same time


193 :
[Takeshi]
Okay, I'll go first...

[Takeshi]
It's about the lecture today.

[Takeshi]
The 'Love Psychology' lecture.

I scratched my head as I spoke.

[Takeshi]
Did you forget it already...?


194 :

{T4C184}
[Sora]
No...


{T4C185}
[Sora]
I was thinking about it too.

Sora's cheeks were bright red.


195 :
[Takeshi]
You go first.


{T4C186}
[Sora]
Me first...?


{T4C187}
[Sora]
Well, um...


{T4C188}
[Sora]
It's about today's lecture...


196 :

{T4C189}
[Sora]
'Love Psychology'...

Sora's cheeks were bright red.

[Takeshi]
Ah...

[Takeshi]
That's what I wanted to talk about too.

I was probably a little red as well.


197 :
[Takeshi]
Well, let's both say it at the same time.


{T4C190}
[Sora]
Alright.

[Takeshi]
Okay, together then. 3, 2, 1, go!

[Takeshi]
It's about the lecture today...


{T4C191}
[Sora]
...It's about the lecture today.

Ah, I had spoken a moment sooner.

...Well, okay.


198 :

{T4C192}
[Sora]
'Love Psychology'...

Sora's cheeks were bright red.

[Takeshi]
Ah, that...

I was probably a little red too.


199 :

{T4C193}
[Sora]
Teehee...


200 :
We were reflected on the glass of the kiosk.

Sora twinkled as she spoke.


201 :

{T4C194}
[Sora]
I... wanted to speak about the lecture.


{T4C195}
[Sora]
"£o¢o-chan was afraid of me, and Tanaka-san seemed
mad about something..."


{T4C196}
[Sora]
"But what you said wasn't wrong... At least 
I don't think so."

[Takeshi]
Hmm, neither do I...

[Takeshi]
"I think my examples may have been a little 
extreme, but I think my basic message was 
right."


202 :

{T4C197}
[Sora]
Yeah?

[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{T4C198}
[Sora]
Professor...


{T4C199}
[Sora]
I would like you to finish the lecture...


{T4C200}
[Sora]
Teach me everything.


{T4C201}
[Sora]
Teach me what I don't know.

[Takeshi]
Alright then, Akanegasaki-kun.


203 :
The lecture resumed.

After-hours studies.

She was the only one participating in my
lecture. No one else was listening.

It was a one-on-one lecture.

[Takeshi]
"Well, Akanegasaki-kun, we're going to get 
back to the basics."

I played it up a little.


204 :

{T4C202}
[Sora]
Professor! I have a question!

[Takeshi]
Mm, what is it?


205 :

{T4C203}
[Sora]
You weren't acting like this earlier today!

[Takeshi]
Ahem!

I pretended to clear my throat.

[Takeshi]
"The professor is practicing speaking like a 
professor!"

[Takeshi]
Let's not worry about how to talk!

[Takeshi]
"The way you're talking is fine. There are 
gentlemen who prefer gentle voices."


206 :
I went into the kiosk alone.

The inside of the kiosk, which had not been used
since the second flood, was strewn with
colorful stationery and merchandise.


207 :

{T4C204}
[Sora]
Professor, what should I do?

[Takeshi]
Just stand there.


208 :

{T4C205}
[Sora]
Alright.

Sora was waiting just outside the kiosk.


209 :
I jumped over the counter.


210 :
I brushed aside the stuff that was lying
around and went over to the window.


211 :
[Takeshi]
Alright then, Akanegasaki-kun...


{T4C206}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it, Professor?

[Takeshi]
Come a little closer.

From inside the kiosk, I beckoned to Sora.


Sora approached the glass.

She stopped about a meter away.


212 :

{T4C207}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, if I go any closer, the RSD image 
will..."

[Takeshi]
"Don't be so unromantic or you'll spoil the 
mood."


213 :

{T4C208}
[Sora]
But I'll probably start to look flat...

Embarrassed, she bowed her head.

[Takeshi]
It's fine, it's fine. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
Repeat after me: 'It's fine, it's fine!'


214 :

{T4C209}
[Sora]
I-it's fine, it's fine...

Blushing furiously, Sora timidly approached
the window.

Slowly, one step at a time.

[Takeshi]
That's it.


215 :
Before long...

Sora and I faced each other through the thin
sheet of glass.


{T4C210}
[Sora]
Here I am.


{T4C211}
[Sora]
Um, do I look strange, Professor?

[Takeshi]
Don't worry.

[Takeshi]
I told you it was alright, didn't I?

Her image was warping a little, but it was
nothing serious.

[Takeshi]
Alright then, practice.


{T4C212}
[Sora]
Uh, um, I'm a little nervous...

[Takeshi]
Well, don't let me make you nervous.

[Takeshi]
Relax, relax. Okay, repeat.


{T4C213}
[Sora]
Relax, relax...

In my hand, I held a marker pen that I had
picked up off the floor.

It was a red, water-based pen.

[Takeshi]
"Alright then. You know, I thought you were 
a traditional Japanese girl."


{T4C214}
[Sora]
R-really?

[Takeshi]
Ah. Pure and sincere. Lovely.

[Takeshi]
"But I felt that, as a 24-year-old, you were 
lacking a little something."


{T4C215}
[Sora]
What...?

[Takeshi]
Color... The look of a grown woman.

Sora was standing on the other side of the
spotless glass.


216 :
I took the cap off the pen and traced the
line of Sora's lips.

[Takeshi]
The fastest way to give you color...

[Takeshi]
...Is with makeup!

[Takeshi]
"With conservative makeup like yours, you 
won't even attract doctors or lawyers!"

[Takeshi]
Your makeup has to be more... feminine.


{T4C216}
[Sora]
Professor...


{T4C217}
[Sora]
I don't understand what you mean.

[Takeshi]
A picture is worth a thousand words.

I carefully drew her lipstick.


{T4C218}
[Sora]
That tickles.

[Takeshi]
Stand still, Akanegasaki-kun.

[Takeshi]
This is difficult.


{T4C219}
[Sora]
I'm not moving!

Maybe my hand wasn't used to the angle;
anyway, it was shaking a little.

I drew her eyeline, gave her mascara and
rouge, and colored in her eyebrows.


217 :
[Takeshi]
Alright, you're done!

Finished!

What a work of art.

If I would give it a title...

I'd call it...

Yes, I'd call it...

'Butterfly of the Night'.


218 :

{T4C220}
[Sora]
Uh, Professor...


{T4C221}
[Sora]
Is... this feminine makeup?

[Takeshi]
Um, well...

[Takeshi]
Not quite...


{T4C222}
[Sora]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Um...

[Takeshi]
It's actually...

Over the top.

REALLY over the top.

It was a complete failure.

It looked like a child's scribbling.


{T4C223}
[Sora]
"I've never looked like this! This is a 
change!"

[Takeshi]
"I've never seen anything, uh, quite like 
this..."


{T4C224}
[Sora]
I think I like it.

[Takeshi]
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Akanegasaki-kun.

[Takeshi]
You really, truly think so...?


{T4C225}
[Sora]
What!? You don't... like it?


{T4C226}
[Sora]
...I-I thought so!

[Takeshi]
What do you mean?

[Sora]
.........

[Takeshi]
...Akanegasaki-kun...?

[Sora]
.........


219 :
[Takeshi]
Aaaargh!

[Takeshi]
It's all wrong!

I tried to rub the lipstick off with my hand.

But it wouldn't come off.

The more I tried to wipe it off, the more the
lipstick spread on her face.


{T4C227}
[Sora]
Professor!


{T4C228}
[Sora]
Is this feminine makeup?

All around Sora's mouth was stained red.

[Takeshi]
Akanegasaki-kun...

[Takeshi]
Not exactly.

Without meaning to, I laughed.


{T4C229}
[Sora]
P-Professor?

[Takeshi]
Mm... mhhh... haaa... haaaa...

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry...

[Takeshi]
But it's certainly a change. Haaa... haaa!

I was apologizing, but I couldn't stop
laughing.


{T4C230}
[Sora]
Ooohh! Professor!


{T4C231}
[Sora]
Stop playing with my face!


220 :
Then Sora started to laugh as well.


{T4C232}
[Sora]
Teeheehee...


{T4C233}
[Sora]
Hahaha...!

We both collapsed laughing.

The sound of our laughter filled the silence
of the nighttime kiosk.

It had been ages since I had laughed like that.


And after we had laughed for a while...

Sora moved over to the next window.


221 :

{T4C234}
[Sora]
Please do it properly this time.

Sora's face became serious.

[Takeshi]
Alright, okay, okay...

[Takeshi]
"This time, I promise you perfect 
feminine beauty..."

I picked up the pen again and faced the glass.

[Takeshi]
........

I faced it, but...


{T4C235}
[Sora]
What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
Nothing...


222 :
I didn't draw anything with the pen.

I stared deep into Sora's eyes through the
glass.


{T4C236}
[Sora]
Professor... Kuranari?

Her glossy lips were forming my name.


{T4C237}
[Sora]
Uummmm...

[Takeshi]
Let's not do this.


{T4C238}
[Sora]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
You don't need makeup...

[Takeshi]
"You don't need makeup, Sora. You're already 
beautiful."


223 :

{T4C239}
[Sora]
Professor...


{T4C240}
[Sora]
Don't tease me.

[Takeshi]
I'm not teasing you, I mean it.


{T4C241}
[Sora]
Don't say that, Professor.

I could see Sora blushing.


{T4C242}
[Sora]
"If you say that, Professor, I'll start to 
take you seriously..."

She bowed her head, her eyes searching around.


{T4C243}
[Sora]
I...

[Takeshi]
No more playing teacher.


{T4C244}
[Sora]
Professor?


{T4C245}
[Sora]
Uh... Kuranari-san?

Sora slowly raised her head and looked me in
the eyes.

[Takeshi]
Sora...

[Takeshi]
Your hands...


{T4C246}
[Sora]
Hmmm?

[Takeshi]
Put your hands here.


224 :
I put my hands against the glass.

Sora placed her hands where mine were.


Right against left, left against right.

Separated only by a pane of glass, our hands
were touching.

It felt strange.

What should be a barrier between us was
actually the only thing joining us.

Without something between us, we couldn't
touch.

But on either side of the glass, we were
able to confirm the existence of the other.


It felt as if my hands were touching Sora's
body.

Sora's face was there in front of me, mere
centimeters from me.

We were so close, it felt like I could hear her breathing.

I thought that I could probably even take her
in my arms.


{T4C247}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{T4C248}
[Sora]
May I ask you something?

[Takeshi]
Go ahead...


{T4C249}
[Sora]
I feel warm...


{T4C250}
[Sora]
I feel really warm...


{T4C251}
[Sora]
From my fingers... and in my heart...


{T4C252}
[Sora]
What's happening...?


{T4C253}
[Sora]
Why do you think...?

[Takeshi]
.........

I couldn't answer.

Sora's eyes glistened with tears as she
stared at me.

The glass in the window was shaking.

Sora's warmth spread to my hand.

But it was just an illusion.

If I closed my eyes, Sora disappeared.

But in my hand I could feel the warmth like
sunshine.

Even if the warmth was just an illusion...

Sora existed there and then. Of that, I was
certain.
