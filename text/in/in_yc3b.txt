1 :
After that...

Y¤u and I headed to the conference room.

We didn't have any specific objective in mind.

Actually, we made for the conference room
precisely because we didn't have any objective.

It wasn't that anyone had said we would meet
there; somehow, it had just become our meeting
place and hangout.

{16:4}

2 :
We were all there.

Sora and Takeshi teased me, saying that the
night before, I had been flailing around like
a crab on its back.

They said that I had worried them, but that
they thought I seemed better.

It was almost exactly the same thing I had
heard from Sara.

They asked why I had gone crazy when I saw
the mirror‡LI avoided giving a clear-cut
answer.

{16:4}

3 :
I didn't think that I could get them to
understand a situation as complex as that by
just telling them the real reason up front.

It appeared that Takeshi and Sora were
satisfied with my evasive explanation.

{16:4}

understand a situation as complex as that by
just telling them the real reason up front.

It appeared that Takeshi and Sora were
satisfied with my evasive explanation.

{16:4}

7 :
And then... small talk started.

Strangely, we only talked idly, gossiping
about things and not touching on LeMU at all.

We talked about the best movies we'd ever
seen, and why whales stranded themselves on
the beach in groups...

And what the truth behind the assassination
of JFK was, as well as whether forks or
chopsticks were better.

{16:4}

8 :
Topics changed often, and we talked about a
wide range of things, from the serious to
the silly.

In short, we were just killing time.


We tried to fill in the time by keeping our
mouths moving.

I didn't participate much in the conversation, just
kind of nodding from time to time and laughing along
with everyone.

{16:4}

9 :
It wasn't that I was necessarily thinking about
anything else, I just thought of it all as a
painless way to kill time.

In the group, there was one other person who
was just as quiet as myself... even more so,
since she didn't open her mouth once.

{1}

10 :
It was Tsugumi.

{16:4}

11 :
Tsugumi looked as furious as ever.

She had a constantly dissatisfied look,
making it seem as if she had been
dissatisfied from the day she was born and
was probably destined to stay that way.

I figured if she was that annoyed, she
shouldn't come to where everyone had
gathered, but of course, I couldn't say that
to her.

Tsugumi glanced at me at a rate of once every
two minutes. I counted.

{16:4}

12 :
In the afternoon two days before, May 1st,
she had been short with me.

{1}

She had told me not to talk to her.

{1}

However, her looking at me about once every
two minutes was totally at odds with those
words and seemed like a sign saying, 'Speak
with me.'

Her glances unnerved me, and I was unable to
focus my attention on the conversation.

{16:4}

13 :
.........

Eventually, the four others got tired of
talking, and gradually the conversation slowed
down.

Finally, the talking ground to a halt
completely.

Five hours had passed since we had come to the
conference room.

{16:4}

14 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Sara]
.........


15 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


16 :
[Kid]
.........

Everyone was silent.

Y¤u rested her chin on her hands and watched
a plant in the corner of the room.

Sara put her face on the table and closed her
eyes.

Takeshi stood by the window and stared at the
ocean.

Sora wasn't there. She had gone back to the
control room.

Tsugumi... had just stood up.

She headed toward the exit.

She touched the panel to open and close the
door.


17 :
Just before she left the room, she looked at
me again.


18 :
It bothered me. I couldn't let it not bother
me.

A while after Tsugumi had gone out, I...


[Kid]
I'm going to the bathroom...

Saying that to everybody, I followed Tsugumi.


19 :
I followed the sound of water splashing and
soon found Tsugumi.

She was walking ahead of me in a curved
corridor.


20 :
I ran to Tsugumi and asked her.

[Kid]
Hey, why did you keep looking at me?


21 :
Tsugumi didn't stop walking. She didn't even
look at me.


22 :
I stepped ahead of her and stood in her way.


23 :
[Kid]
"You were shooting sideway glances at me, 
right?"

[Kid]
"And then you glanced at me when you left the 
conference room."


{C3A242}
[Tsugumi]
So what?

[Kid]
So... well...


{C3A243}
[Tsugumi]
Yes, I was looking at you.


{C3A244}
[Tsugumi]
But you watched me as well, didn't you?


{C3A245}
[Tsugumi]
If not, you wouldn't have noticed my glance.

[Kid]
You're right...


{C3A246}
[Tsugumi]
So we're even.

[Kid]
But you started watching me first.


{C3A247}
[Tsugumi]
Is that a problem?

[Kid]
No problem, but...


{C3A248}
[Tsugumi]
"What? Are you afraid you'll turn into a 
pillar of salt if someone looks at you?"

[Kid]
No...


24 :

{C3A249}
[Tsugumi]
Fine then.


25 :
Saying that, Tsugumi started to walk.

I blocked her way, holding out my arm.


26 :
[Kid]
Wait a minute.

[Kid]
Don't change the subject.

[Kid]
"What I wanted to know was the reason why you 
were glancing at me."


{C3A250}
[Tsugumi]
Do I need a reason?


{C3A251}
[Tsugumi]
Do you need a reason to look at someone?

[Kid]
You're trying to change the topic again...


{C3A252}
[Tsugumi]
"Then why are you asking me such a stupid 
question?"

[Kid]
Because I want to know.


{C3A253}
[Tsugumi]
To know what?

[Kid]
About you, Tsugumi...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
"Tsugumi, you want to say something to me, 
don't you?"


27 :
Tsugumi looked down.

She dragged her leg slightly on the ground
behind her.

There, ripples spread over the surface of water.

Tsugumi's eyes absently followed the directions
that the ripples spread in.


28 :
She looked up.

We stared at each other.

Tsugumi pushed her hair back softly with her
little finger and said...


{C3A254}
[Tsugumi]
I have many things I want to say.


{C3A255}
[Tsugumi]
But I can't say them yet.

She spoke in a mild, calm tone.

[Kid]
"Hey, Tsugumi? Why do you keep trying to hide 
so many things?"

[Kid]
You can't trust us yet?


{C3A256}
[Tsugumi]
No.

[Kid]
"Then why did you help us with repairs when 
the flooding accident happened today?"


{C3A257}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't help you.

[Kid]
What?


{C3A258}
[Tsugumi]
I did the repairs and everyone else helped me.

[Kid]
"You can look at that any way you want. It's 
not important."

[Kid]
"What is important is that you tried to help 
us anyway, right?"


{C3A259}
[Tsugumi]
Yes.

Tsugumi said it simply.


29 :

{C3A260}
[Tsugumi]
I just don't trust you guys.


{C3A261}
[Tsugumi]
It's not that I have a grudge against you.


{C3A262}
[Tsugumi]
"There's nothing special about helping 
someone during an emergency, is there?"


{C3A263}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't care about what happens to myself, 
but... I can't just sit around doing nothing when 
someone is going to die."


{C3A264}
[Tsugumi]
Especially in circumstances like this...

It was an unexpected answer.

Little by little, Tsugumi might have been
seeing our side of things.

[Kid]
Okay.

[Kid]
I'll ask you a different question...

[Kid]
"You show yourself around us often even though 
you're saying that you don't trust us, right?"

[Kid]
"If you doubt us, you don't have to hang out 
with us."

[Kid]
You can act on your own.

[Kid]
"Tsugumi... you actually want to be 'buddies' 
with us, don't you?"

I was kind of taking a gamble.

If she had answered back like something like
'Fine. If that's what you want, I'll never
show my face again'‡Lthen that would have
been the end of things.

I waited for her reaction.


30 :

{C3A265}
[Tsugumi]
Heh heh...

Tsugumi laughed.


{C3A266}
[Tsugumi]
Hehehehehehehehe...

She kept shaking her head and laughing hard.


[Kid]
Wh-what's so funny?


{C3A267}
[Tsugumi]
Because... you said 'buddy'...


{C3A268}
[Tsugumi]
We're not school kids, you know...


{C3A269}
[Tsugumi]
I am much older than you think.

Tsugumi covered her mouth as she kept laughing.

[Kid]
H-hey, stop laughing!

[Kid]
I... I'm being serious!


{C3A270}
[Tsugumi]
Heeheehee...

[Kid]
If I'm wrong, then what is it...?

[Kid]
"If you don't want to be 'buddies' with us 
then why do you come to where everybody is?"


31 :

{C3A271}
[Tsugumi]
Do you really want to know?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...


{C3A272}
[Tsugumi]
I can tell you why if you want, but...


{C3A273}
[Tsugumi]
"I want you to answer this question in 
exchange."

[Kid]
?


{C3A274}
[Tsugumi]
Do you know about Jewel chocolate?

[Kid]
...What?


{C3A275}
[Tsugumi]
Jewel chocolate.


32 :
{11:0-dd}
{11:1}I know about it

{11:1}I don't know about it


33 :
[Kid]
Y-yeah... It's a kind of chocolate bar, right?

[Kid]
A toy ring comes with it as an extra surprise...


{C3A276}
[Tsugumi]
Right.


34 :
[Kid]
I don't know...

I answered honestly.


{C3A277}
[Tsugumi]
Jewel chocolate is an ordinary chocolate bar.


{C3A278}
[Tsugumi]
"But the special thing is that a toy ring 
comes with it as an extra surprise."

[Kid]
I see...


35 :

{C3A279}
[Tsugumi]
"There are 34 types of the toy rings in 
total."


{C3A280}
[Tsugumi]
"If you want to collect all of the rings, 
then you have to keep buying the chocolate."


{C3A281}
[Tsugumi]
But don't you think that's a little odd?


{C3A282}
[Tsugumi]
The relationship is backwards here.


{C3A283}
[Tsugumi]
"Really, the chocolate should be the primary 
reason for buying it, and the ring should 
be secondary."


{C3A284}
[Tsugumi]
"But for people that collect rings, the 
chocolate is kind of a secondary benefit."

[Kid]
"So you mean that chocolate becomes 'something 
extra' after the rings?"


{C3A285}
[Tsugumi]
That's right.

[Kid]
"But... so what...? What does that have to do 
with what we were talking about?"


36 :

{C3A286}
[Tsugumi]
Don't you get it?

I tilted my head.


{C3A287}
[Tsugumi]
"The primary reason that I go to everybody is 
not to see them."

[Kid]
?


37 :

{C3A288}
[Tsugumi]
I just...

Tsugumi stopped talking. The smile was gone
from her face.


38 :
She stared at me with a serious look.


It was a tense look.

Just looking at her deep and dark-colored
eyes, I felt as if I were about to be absorbed.

But I couldn't look away. I couldn't even
budge.

My body was stiff, like a pillar of salt.


{C3A289}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just...


{C3A290}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just collecting rings.


{C3A291}
[Tsugumi]
The chocolate is an added benefit.

As she said that, I didn't know why, but
she suddenly touched my ear.

She traced the outline of my ear and pinched
my earlobe tenderly.

In that moment, my body burst into fragments.


39 :
I didn't remember what happened after that.

I just found myself in the middle of the
corridor standing in a daze.

Tsugumi had disappeared at some point.


{C3A290}
[Tsugumi]
I'm just collecting rings.

Tsugumi's voice echoed in my head.


40 :
I wobbled back to the conference room.


41 :
When I entered the room, only Y¤u and Sara
were there.

They were lying on the table and breathing as
if they were asleep.

Their legs were facing me.

I could almost see their underwear.


But I wasn't interested in it.

(Not interested?)

Pretending not to be interested, I walked around
the table and shook Y¤u's body slightly.



42 :

{C3A292}
[Y¤u]
Ah, aaaah...

Y¤u opened her eyes, rubbing one of them with
her hand.


43 :

{C3A293}
[Y¤u]
Hey... Kid... Welcome back...

[Kid]
"You'll catch a cold sleeping in a place like 
this."


{C3A294}
[Y¤u]
I'm alright...


{C3A295}
[Y¤u]
Mayo's body is... warm, so...


44 :
Saying that, Y¤u hugged Sara's body tightly.

Sara said something in delirium, but she
didn't seem to wake up.

I figured they both had to be tired...

[Kid]
What about Takeshi?


{C3A296}
[Y¤u]
I think he went to... the merry-go-round...

[Kid]
"You mean... the merry-go-round with the 
dolphins?"


{C3A297}
[Y¤u]
Yeah...


{C3A298}
[Y¤u]
That's what he said... before he left...

[Kid]
Did he go alone?

As I asked, I realized that I'd already known
the answer.

Sora was in the control room. I had met
Tsugumi a minute ago.

Y¤u and Sara were holding each other like
koalas in front of me...


{C3A299}
[Y¤u]
He went alone...

Y¤u answered me.


{C3A300}
[Y¤u]
Alright then...


{C3A301}
[Y¤u]
"Can you let me sleep... now? I'm having a nice 
time..."

Having a nice time?

Y¤u might have been half in a dream.


45 :
She closed her eyes slowly.


46 :
I went up the emergency stairs and headed for
the merry-go-round.

I thought briefly that it would be nice to go
to sleep between Y¤u and Sara. Unfortunately,
I wasn't sleepy at all.

Besides, I was curious about what Takeshi was
doing at the merry-go-round.

If I remembered correctly, Takeshi had been
sitting on a dolphin earlier in the day as
well.

Sara had told me that.

I wondered if riding on the merry-go-round
alone was fun.

If that was something fun for him, Takeshi
was kind of freaky.


47 :

{C3A302}
[Takeshi]
Kyahahaha! Kyahahahaha!


{C3A303}
[Takeshi]
I am the king of the dolphin kingdom!


48 :
I could imagine Takeshi having fun by himself.

But if he wasn't there for his amusement,
then I wanted to know the reason why he was
going to the merry-go-round so often.

Anyway, I was itching to find out the truth.


That was why I didn't mind climbing up seventeen
meters of stairs.


49 :
I came out on a straight corridor.

After I walked for a while, I could see a door on
the left side.

There was a dolphin merry-go-round through the
door.

The door had been left open.

I sneaked into the room, trying not to make a
sound.


50 :
Takeshi was there.

He was alone, as I expected.

Takeshi was all alone...


51 :

{C3A304}
[Takeshi]
Where are you!?


{C3A305}
[Takeshi]
Hey! You!


52 :

{C3A306}
[Takeshi]
Oh, come on! What IS this!?

He was wandering around in front of the
merry-go-round as he screamed nonsense.

It was as if he were chasing something
invisible...

He might have thought he was chasing
butterflies over the flower garden.

That was what it looked like to me.


{C3A307}
[Takeshi]
You've known it all along, right?


53 :

{C3A308}
[Takeshi]
There's no way I can catch you...


{C3A309}
[Takeshi]
"No matter how hard I try... I can't 
catch... you..."

Takeshi was talking to a fake dolphin,
tropical fish, and seaweed.

There was obviously something wrong with him...

He was sicker than I imagined.

It was no time to laugh. I was paralyzed with
fear. I didn't even have the presence of mind
to feel sorry for him.

(He's gone crazy because he's locked up in a
place like this...)

(We didn't even notice, but somewhere along
the line, he just snapped...)


{C3A310}
[Takeshi]
Is something wrong?


{C3A311}
[Takeshi]
Are you worn out?


{C3A312}
[Takeshi]
Nothing bad's happened, has it?

It seemed that Takeshi was worried about the
dolphins.

I clasped my hands together as if in a prayer
pose.

I decided to leave without saying anything.

I decided to pretend I hadn't seen it and
keep it to myself.


54 :
I started walking toward the exit.

As the distance between myself and Takeshi
grew, I couldn't hear what he said.

Only one thing reached me...


{C3A313}
[Takeshi]
Clone Law?


55 :
And then my vision twisted crazily.

Wait, maybe the attack hit before his voice
did.

I didn't know...

I didn't know... but in any case, I lost my
sense of balance.

I couldn't tell what was up or down.

It was such a sudden change that it threw me.

I felt an urge to vomit... and a headache...

[Kid]
Who... are you?

[Kid]
Who... am I?

It was my voice, but it wasn't mine...

I lost consciousness...

I crashed to the floor.

Was it me that fell? Or someone else that
wasn't me?

I felt myself sinking into the ground.

Was I sinking? Or was the floor trying to
swallow me?

I didn't know... I didn't know... I didn't
know...


{C3A314}
[Takeshi]
Clone Law?


{C3A315}
[Takeshi]
C-L-O-N-E LAW?


{C3A316}
[Takeshi]
C-L-O-N-E L-A-W?


{C3A317}
[Takeshi]
C-L-O-N-E L-A-W?

I melted into the pure white darkness.


56 :
[Takeshi]
Clone Law?


{C3A318}
[Sora]
Yes... the 'Clone Law'.

[Takeshi]
I dunno. I mean, I forgot.


{C3A319}
[Sora]
In 2010...


{C3A320}
[Sora]
"Human cloning, which had been illegal up 
until then, was allowed by law."


{C3A321}
[Sora]
"Currently, as long as anyone receives the approval 
of the authorities, they can undergo clone 
fertilization as a way to treat infertility."


{T3B901}
[Sora]
"The nucleus is taken from an already-
cultivated somatic cell and inserted
into an egg that has had its original
nucleus removed."

{T3B9019012}
[Sora]
"Then it is implanted into 
the mother's womb..."

[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right, I remember now!


{C3A323}
[Sora]
Do you understand?

[Takeshi]
But what does that have to do with this?

[Takeshi]
"Clones develop separately. In other words, 
they're different entities."

[Takeshi]
"They're not the same person. They're more 
like twins..."


{C3A324}
[Sora]
But their source is the same.

Sora spoke almost casually.


{C3A325}
[Sora]
"Let's go back to what we were talking 
about..."


57 :

{C3A326}
[Sora]
I am‡Lomnipresent.


{C3A327}
[Sora]
"There can be several of me existing in the 
same space at the same time."


{C3A328}
[Sora]
"For example, in front of you and in front of 
£o¢o-chan."


{C3A329}
[Sora]
There and here, there are two of me.


{C3A330}
[Sora]
But they are definitely not 'W'...


{C3A331}
[Sora]
But 'Y'.

[Takeshi]
'Y'?


{C3A332}
[Sora]
You see... Please think of it this way.


{C3A333}
[Sora]
"What if you could be copied exactly, just 
the way you are?"

[Takeshi]
?


{C3A334}
[Sora]
For instance...


{C3A335}
[Sora]
"For instance, what if every recollection, 
thought, feeling, character trait, 
personality, and emotion that is etched into 
your mind..."


{C3A336}
[Sora]
"In other words, your whole intelligence 
could be perfectly, exactly extracted..."


{C3A337}
[Sora]
"And then duplicated in some kind of 
storage medium, even reproducing all your 
abilities..."


{C3A338}
[Sora]
Then where is the real 'you'?


{C3A339}
[Sora]
"The 'you' who stays in your body, is that the 
real 'you'?"


{C3A340}
[Sora]
Or is the duplicate character, in fact, 'you'?

[Takeshi]
.........


{C3A341}
[Sora]
"The answer is, in any case, that 
the real 'you' does exist in both."


58 :

{C3A342}
[Sora]
Yes... You have divided into two.


{C3A343}
[Sora]
"Historically, and from that moment forward, 
the two of you are traveling down the time 
axis as separate entities."


59 :

{C3A344}
[Sora]
"But if you turn around and look at the 
journey you have taken, you will see that the 
two of you were joined together at one point."


60 :

{C3A345}
[Sora]
"It is split like a 'Y', with two points 
emerging from one line. Not a 'W', with two 
separate points of origin."


61 :

{C3A346}
[Sora]
"You may be unable to imagine two of yourself 
splitting apart and going different ways at a 
particular base point."


{C3A347}
[Sora]
"But that is something that has already 
happened."


62 :

{C3A348}
[Sora]
"You are always, constantly, approaching a 
choice in each present moment that becomes 
the past the instant you visit it."


{C3A349}
[Sora]
"Will you choose path A? Will you choose 
path B?"


{C3A350}
[Sora]
"The 'you' that is standing here may have come 
down path A, but in another time axis, there 
may be a 'you' who is going down path B."


{C3A351}
[Sora]
"And both the 'you' on path A and the 'you' on 
path B are still 'you'."


63 :

{C3A352}
[Sora]
"Except that the 'you' on path A doesn't know 
about the 'you' on path B."


{C3A353}
[Sora]
Because there is no way to know.


{C3A354}
[Sora]
"In the same way, the 'you' on path B 
probably isn't aware of the 'you' on path A 
either."


64 :

{C3A355}
[Sora]
Do you know why that is?

[Takeshi]
Uh... Tell me if this is basically it.

[Takeshi]
"The 'me' on path A that you are talking about 
is one of the branches of the 'Y', and the 'me' 
on path B is the other branch."

[Takeshi]
"To make it easier to understand, let's say 
that this is all two-dimensional, or on a flat 
plane."

[Takeshi]
"In this case, both my A and B selves would be 
two-dimensional beings."

[Takeshi]
"As two-dimensional beings, they wouldn't have an 
accurate awareness of their two-dimensional 
world at any time."

[Takeshi]
"Just like a person in a three-dimensional world 
can't keep track of all six sides of a die in 
real time."

[Takeshi]
Uh... That means... Let's see...

[Takeshi]
Dang! I lost my train of thought!

[Takeshi]
In other words, basically... it means this!

[Takeshi]
"The person at one end of the 'Y' and the 
person at the other end of the 'Y' can't 
really be aware of each other in real time."

[Takeshi]
"In order to know what's happening at the 
other end of the 'Y'..."

[Takeshi]
"You'd have to extract yourself from the 
two-dimensional plane and view the 'Y' from a 
three-dimensional space."

[Takeshi]
"Until you can do that, even if you 
understand it mentally, there's no way to 
confirm whether both A and B selves exist."


{C3A356}
[Sora]
Well, that is just about right.


{C3A357}
[Sora]
To pick up there...

Sora said that in a matter-of-fact tone.


65 :

{C3A358}
[Sora]
As you have just been saying...


{C3A901}
[Sora]
"Until a being existing in the second dimension 
removes themselves from the second dimension and 
views it from the third-dimensional space 
above..."

{C3A902}
[Sora]
"That person will never fully be able 
to grasp the second dimension."

66 :

{C3A360}
[Sora]
"When that individual gets out of the second 
dimension, only then do they realize that 
there is another branch of the 'Y'..."


{C3A361}
[Sora]
"And realize, too, that there is another 
'you' who took a different branch of the 'Y'."


{C3A362}
[Sora]
Let's try to pull this together.


{C3A363}
[Sora]
"In order to be fully aware of one's 
dimension, one must view it from the next 
dimension, 'n+1'."


67 :

{C3A364}
[Sora]
"Of course, this also applies to three-dimensional 
space."


{C3A365}
[Sora]
"For a person to be fully aware of the third 
dimension, he or she needs to enter the fourth 
dimension."


{C3A366}
[Sora]
"In other words, for you to realize that 
there is another of yourself that has 
branched off..."


{C3A367}
[Sora]
"You must get into the fourth dimension and look 
down into the third dimension."


{C3A368}
[Sora]
"In this case, the fourth-dimensional space 
becomes a type of 'Minkowski Space'... but 
let's not get into that."

[Takeshi]
.........


{C3A369}
[Sora]
So...


{C3A903}
[Sora]
"So with this, I think I have gotten you to 
understand that there can be versions of 
yourself with different histories..."

{C3A904}
[Sora]
"In different worlds and existing in different 
spaces."

{C3A371}
[Sora]
You are omnipresent in the world.


{C3A372}
[Sora]
And in the same way, so am I.


{C3A373}
[Sora]
You and I...


{C3A374}
[Sora]
We are just branches of the 'Y'...


{C3A375}
[Sora]
However...


{C3A376}
[Sora]
These divided selves can become one...


68 :

{C3A377}
[Sora]
"If the self you don't know were to become 
inseparably bound with you..."


{C3A378}
[Sora]
"If you could stand in a place where you 
could see and understand all the others that 
were 'you'..."


{C3A379}
[Sora]
"Then all the experiences of your other selves 
would become like your own experiences."


{C3A380}
[Sora]
In the truest sense, you would become one.

I let out a long sigh.

[Takeshi]
Listen...

[Takeshi]
Can I ask you just one thing?


{C3A381}
[Sora]
Please do...

[Takeshi]
Why are you telling me all of this...?


69 :

{C3A382}
[Sora]
Hmm... That's a good question...

Sora turned in a full circle right where she
was and smiled.

70 :

{C3A383}
[Sora]
It is a legend.


{C3A384}
[Sora]
"It is a legend passed down through the Lemurian
continent... and is the origin behind LeMU."


{C3A385}
[Sora]
Let's just leave it at that.


71 :

{C3A386}
[Sora]
...And you must understand, it is a secret.

Sora held up one finger in front of her mouth.


72 :
And then, without a sound, she vanished.


73 :
For a while, I just stood there, lost in thought.

There was 'doorbell ditching' and 'dining and
dashing', but I figured there wasn't a phrase
like 'chat and run' or 'debate and dash'.

But that was exactly what Sora had just done
to me.

[Takeshi]
Oh well...

Letting out a sigh, I made for the exit.

As I walked, I reflected back on what Sora had
said.

Clones... and dividing selves... Walking in
different times... Simultaneous copies of
Sora... The ubiquitous Sora...

I wondered if Sora was just trying to say that
everything was all the same.

So, maybe Sora, with all her incomprehensible
and special attributes, not having one single self
was really not all that different.

I wondered if that was what Sora had wanted
to say.

I wasn't sure...

But I didn't see much use in thinking any
more about things that I didn't understand...

And then...

Squish.

My foot came into contact with something soft.

It felt as if I were stepping on a person...

[Takeshi]
That's not a person, is it?

One of my feet was standing on the Kid's
small back.

[Takeshi]
Hey! Kid! Kid! Are you alright?

I kneeled down next to him and raised his
body up.


74 :

{C3A387}
[Kid]
Huh...?


75 :

{C3A388}
[Kid]
Ah... Takeshi...

[Takeshi]
Whaddya mean, 'Ah... Takeshi'!?

[Takeshi]
"What're you doing collapsed in a place like 
this?"


76 :

{C3A389}
[Kid]
Place like this?

The Kid bounced up like he had been shocked.


77 :

{C3A390}
[Kid]
Oh yeah...


78 :

{C3A391}
[Kid]
"I don't know what happened. All of a 
sudden, my head hurt and..."


{C3A392}
[Kid]
And then I fell down here.

[Takeshi]
Your head? That could be bad news.


79 :

{C3A393}
[Kid]
No, I'm alright.


{C3A394}
[Kid]
I think a little sleep refreshed me.

[Takeshi]
You sure? You sure you're fine?


80 :

{C3A395}
[Kid]
Yeah...


{C3A396}
[Kid]
But my back kinda hurts...

I decided not to tell him I'd been stepping
on it.


{C3A397}
[Kid]
"And... I'm starved. My stomach won't stop 
growling."

[Takeshi]
I... I see...

[Takeshi]
"Well if you've got an appetite, then you're 
probably okay, but..."

[Takeshi]
"But maybe you should have Sora take a look 
at you?"

[Takeshi]
"Healthy people don't just get headaches and 
collapse all of a sudden."


81 :

{C3A398}
[Kid]
Yaaaawwwwwwwwwnn...

[Takeshi]
Hey! Are you listening to what I'm saying!?


82 :

{C3A399}
[Kid]
Hmm? What?

[Takeshi]
.........


83 :

{C3A400}
[Kid]
Takeshi, you worry too much. I said I'm fine.


{C3A401}
[Kid]
I'm just a little anemic, that's all.


{C3A402}
[Kid]
"And if it's not that, then I'm probably 
tired or hungry."


{C3A403}
[Kid]
"Anyway, the only thing that hurts right now 
is my back."

(Yeah... I just can't bring myself to tell him
I've stepped on it...)


84 :

{C3A404}
[Kid]
"But enough about that, let's get to the 
kiosk!"


{C3A405}
[Kid]
I'm starving!


85 :
Saying that, the Kid made for the exit,
walking briskly.

Shrugging, I watched him go.


86 :
I was famished as well, but there was one
more place I had to go before I went to the
kiosk.

Of course, it was to see Tsugumi.

Her surgery was finished a long time before
Sora's talk about 'W and Y'... over seven
hours before.

I'd asked Sora about Tsugumi's condition.


{T3A199}
[Sora]
"It required a total of 40 stitches and will 
take two months to heal completely."


{T3A200}
[Sora]
"And it will take her a few more months to be 
able to walk normally..."


{T3A201}
[Sora]
"Until a rescue team arrives at LeMU and we 
can get her out of here, she's going to have 
to rest."

We were lucky that there was no damage done
to her brain or organs.

Only her right thigh was injured.

Maybe 'only' wasn't the best way to put it...

In any case, she had a complex fracture and
a severed artery... and if we had taken
any longer to treat her... she might have died
from blood loss.

I was thankful to Y¤u from the bottom of my
heart.


87 :
I entered the infirmary.

Tsugumi was sleeping quietly on the bed in
the far side of the room.

It wasn't my first time visiting her since the
surgery.

I had been in and out from that afternoon to the
evening, again and again.


Thinking about it then, it seemed to me that
the reason Sora had suddenly called me and
explained about the whole 'W and Y' thing...

Had probably been to take my mind off of
Tsugumi.


88 :
Her condition hadn't changed.

She looked peaceful and was breathing steadily.

A white blanket was covering her, and her foot
peeked out from under it.

She had a cast and bandage wrapped around her
right leg.

It looked painful.

The smell of medicine continued to assault my
nose.

The scene was fairly raw, with traces still
visible of where blood had been wiped away.

I reached my hand under the blanket and
gently took Tsugumi's palm in my hand.

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry...

[Takeshi]
I'm so sorry...

All I could do was repeat that mantra over
and over to the resting Tsugumi.


89 :
After eating dinner at the kiosk, the four of
us (Y¤u, £o¢o, the Kid, and myself) moved to
the rest area.

The Kid...


90 :

{C3A406}
[Kid]
Whooooooa, waaaaiiiit~


91 :

{PIPI_10}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!

He was chasing Pipi around, weaving through
the statues.

They looked like they were having fun.

Y¤u...


92 :

{C3A407}
[Y¤u]
I'm going to go look in on Sora.


93 :
With that said, she headed to the control room.

£o¢o...

(Huh?)

I didn't see £o¢o anywhere.

I decided to look into the nearby kiosk.


94 :
But she wasn't there...

No one was.


95 :
I emerged in the corridor.

Squinting, I looked down to the end of the
corridor, but there was no sign of anyone.


Nearby was the entrance to the Lemurian Ruins.

The door was open.

I could hear a small splashing sound coming
from the area.

I entered the room as if it were inviting me
in.


96 :
£o¢o was standing in the center of the room.

She was standing on a stone that was just
above the water's surface... her feet together.

[Takeshi]
£o¢o...


97 :
£o¢o lifted her face. She looked lonely.

I approached her.

[Takeshi]
What... are you up to...?

£o¢o just stood there silently, eyes on the
surface of the water.

Looking closer, I saw that she was clutching
'something' in her left hand.

Then, £o¢o took that 'something' in her right
hand and let loose with it, tossing it into
space.


98 :
‡LSplish.

With a light splashing sound... that 'something'
hit and sank in the water.

It disappeared amidst a circle of expanding
ripples.

‡LSplish.

£o¢o threw something again.

There was a small spray of water.

The lights' reflection on the water shook
uncertainly.

Splish... splish... splish...

Just as the waves were about to die away, £o¢o
launched something into the water.

But the area was dark, and I couldn't see what
it was.

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o?


99 :

{C3A408}
[£o¢o]
Hmmmmm?

[Takeshi]
What... is that?

£o¢o opened her hand and showed me.

In her palm were tiny, pebble-sized pellets.


I wondered if they were glass. They were
transparent and shaped like water droplets.

Crystal teardrops... that was how they looked.


It was as if she had a handful of tears.

[Takeshi]
Glass tears?

[£o¢o]
.........

£o¢o flicked one of them with the tip of her
finger.

‡LSplish.

And that 'tear' sank into the water.


100 :

{C3A409}
[£o¢o]
I...


{C3A410}
[£o¢o]
I've been thinking about Tsugumin...

£o¢o said that, ignoring my question.


{C3A411}
[£o¢o]
It's my fault...

[Takeshi]
...What?


{C3A412}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin... She was just trying... to save me...


{C3A413}
[£o¢o]
She was trying to help me...


{C3A414}
[£o¢o]
That's why... Tsugumin... Why Tsugumin...

£o¢o's shoulders shook.


{C3A415}
[£o¢o]
Really... I should have been the one who got hurt...


{C3A416}
[£o¢o]
No...


{C3A417}
[£o¢o]
"If Tsugumin hadn't saved me... I might have 
died..."

‡LSplish.

The 'tear' traced an arc through the air
before falling into the water.


{C3A418}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin...


{C3A419}
[£o¢o]
I wonder if she's angry...

[Takeshi]
Don't be silly.

[Takeshi]
Why would Tsugumi be angry with you?

[Takeshi]
"Even if she was angry with anyone, it would 
be me."

[Takeshi]
I mean, my carelessness caused everything...

[Takeshi]
I'm the one to blame...

I thought that the sadness £o¢o was
feeling... was all my fault as well...


101 :

{C3A420}
[£o¢o]
No... No...


{C3A421}
[£o¢o]
It's not your fault...


{C3A422}
[£o¢o]
It was me... I'm to blame...


102 :

{C3A423}
[£o¢o]
It's because I wasn't paying attention...


{C3A424}
[£o¢o]
"That's why... Tsugumin had to get hurt instead 
of me..."

£o¢o let the 'tears' she was holding fall,
scattering below her.

A burst of white spray erupted from the
water's surface below her.


103 :

{C3A425}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon!

Jumping off of the rock, £o¢o came bounding
into my chest.


{C3A426}
[£o¢o]
I'm going to go apologize to Tsugumin...


{C3A427}
[£o¢o]
I'm going to go tell her... that I'm sorry...


{C3A428}
[£o¢o]
That I'm sorry... Just real sorry...

£o¢o continued to bury her face in my chest,
crying.

£o¢o's tears seeped through into my skin and
into my core, like rain falling on my heart.

Cold rain.

The small ripples on the water continued to
fan out, never disappearing.


104 :
£o¢o and I went to the infirmary.

Inside the room was silent.

We approached Tsugumi's bed carefully, so as
not to make a sound.


105 :
Tsugumi's eyes were open.

She turned her face toward us.


{C3A429}
[Tsugumi]
What...?

[Takeshi]
We came to see how you're doing.

[Takeshi]
How are you?


{C3A430}
[Tsugumi]
Same as I look...


{C3A431}
[Tsugumi]
No more, no less.

[Takeshi]
I see...


{C3A432}
[Tsugumi]
Is that all?

[Takeshi]
No...

I didn't know how to say what had to be said.

I didn't think that just saying 'I'm sorry'
and bowing my head would get my feelings
across.

I wanted to choose my words carefully.

But...


{C3A433}
[£o¢o]
I... I...


{C3A434}
[£o¢o]
"I came because I want to apologize to you, 
Tsugumin..."

£o¢o opened her mouth before I could speak.


{C3A435}
[Tsugumi]
Apologize?


{C3A436}
[£o¢o]
Y-yes...


{C3A437}
[£o¢o]
"Because, because... you were trying to help 
me..."


{C3A438}
[£o¢o]
"So... that's why... I have to say I'm 
sorry... I'm so sorry..."


{C3A439}
[£o¢o]
And... And besides that...


{C3A440}
[£o¢o]
I wanted to say thank you...


{C3A441}
[£o¢o]
"I wanted to say sorry and thank you. Sorry 
and thank you, Tsugumin..."

£o¢o's voice shook, and she almost sobbed as
she tied her words together.


106 :

{C3A442}
[Tsugumi]
Ha. You silly girl...

Tsugumi's expression hinted at a smile.


{C3A443}
[Tsugumi]
£o¢o. You don't have to say 'thank you'.


{C3A444}
[Tsugumi]
"Of course, you don't have to apologize 
either."


{C3A445}
[Tsugumi]
Because you didn't do anything wrong, £o¢o...


{C3A446}
[£o¢o]
But... But...


{C3A447}
[Tsugumi]
Please, don't look so sad. Alright?

Tsugumi extended one of her arms from the bed.


She touched her palm to £o¢o's cheek.


{C3A448}
[Tsugumi]
"Everything happened because it was supposed 
to."


{C3A449}
[Tsugumi]
It's no one's fault.

I had never seen Tsugumi be so nice, so gentle.


Her piercing gaze and sharp tongue... they
could have belonged to an entirely different
person.

For an instant, I wondered what would have
happened if I had come to see her alone.

Maybe Tsugumi was opening up to £o¢o.


{C3A450}
[Tsugumi]
"Hey, £o¢o? Try to remember that time and what 
happened."


{C3A451}
[Tsugumi]
Who asked £o¢o to hold the pipe?


{C3A452}
[£o¢o]
It was...


{C3A453}
[Tsugumi]
Me...


{C3A454}
[Tsugumi]
I asked you to.


{C3A455}
[Tsugumi]
"So, the reason that you were standing there 
was because I told you to."


{C3A456}
[Tsugumi]
So... it was my fault.


{C3A457}
[£o¢o]
That has nothing to do with it!


{C3A458}
[Tsugumi]
"Yeah, maybe you're right... Maybe it 
doesn't..."


{C3A459}
[Tsugumi]
"So that would mean me pushing you out of the 
way and all those scrap materials 
falling was nobody's fault... right?"


{C3A460}
[Tsugumi]
"That's how the cause and effect of things 
works."


{C3A461}
[Tsugumi]
"If you look for the cause, it just leads 
everywhere, to no end..."


{C3A462}
[Tsugumi]
"The cause of the cause of the 
cause... Chasing after that and thinking in 
that way is kind of pointless, right?"


{C3A463}
[Tsugumi]
That's why I said what I did.


{C3A464}
[Tsugumi]
"Everything happened because it was supposed 
to."

[£o¢o]
.........


{C3A465}
[Tsugumi]
Besides...


{C3A466}
[Tsugumi]
"What I did helped minimize the number of 
injuries, and I think it was a good decision."


{C3A467}
[Tsugumi]
I helped you.


{C3A468}
[Tsugumi]
And I... I am still alive...


{C3A469}
[Tsugumi]
So... that makes everything okay...


{C3A470}
[Tsugumi]
Do you see what I'm saying?

After thinking it over for a while, £o¢o
nodded without much confidence.


{C3A471}
[Tsugumi]
"It's alright if you don't understand it 
right now."


{C3A472}
[Tsugumi]
You're probably still too young to understand it.

[£o¢o]
.........


{C3A473}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, just don't blame yourself.


{C3A474}
[Tsugumi]
And don't get that sad look either.

Tsugumi gently pinched £o¢o's cheek with her
fingers.


{C3A475}
[Tsugumi]
Alright? You got it?


{C3A476}
[£o¢o]
Yeah...

£o¢o furrowed her brow and gave a solid nod.


[Takeshi]
Uh...

Looking for a good time to chime in, I
finally found my voice.

Tsugumi had said it was all nobody's fault,
but I still felt I had to apologize to her.


I was the one that had created the
opportunity that made the accident possible.


{C3A477}
[Tsugumi]
What is it?

Tsugumi's expression was as mild as before.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi...

Just as I was about to say I was sorry...


107 :
The shrill scream of a warning siren rang
loudly in my ears.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what's that!?


108 :

{C3A478}
[£o¢o]
Oh no! Not more flooding!?

£o¢o's face went pale.


109 :
Focusing her eyes on one point on the wall,
Tsugumi raised her body up.


110 :
[Takeshi]
W-wait! Tsugumi, what are you doing!?


{C3A479}
[Tsugumi]
I'm gonna see what's going on.

[Takeshi]
"S-stupid! You have to rest! You can't go 
moving around!"


{C3A480}
[Tsugumi]
I'm fine. This injury is no big deal...

[Takeshi]
No big deal?

[Takeshi]
"You're really something! I can't believe 
you're so stupid!"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Just stay here and take it easy!

[Takeshi]
I'll go check things out.


{C3A481}
[Tsugumi]
But...

[Takeshi]
No buts!

[Takeshi]
"Got it? I don't want you moving a single millimeter! 
Because if you do, you have to deal with me!"


111 :
I put my hand on Tsugumi's shoulder and laid
her back on the bed.

[Takeshi]
"As soon as I figure out what's going on, 
I'll come back."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.

Saying that, I jetted out of the room.


112 :

{C3A482}
[£o¢o]
Uh, wait! I'm coming too! I'm coming!


113 :
I dashed out of the infirmary.

I looked to the left and the right.

£o¢o, trailing behind me, grabbed and
squeezed my hand.


114 :

{C3A483}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon... What're we gonna do...?

£o¢o sounded scared.

[Takeshi]
For now, we'll go to where everybody else is!


115 :
I pulled along £o¢o as I ran.


116 :
I headed for Dritter Stock.

I descended the stairs in a blur.


117 :
I peeked into the control room...

No one was there.


118 :
Kicking up water, I sprinted down the corridor.

The alarm was still blaring.

I strained to listen.

I didn't hear the sound of seawater rushing
in or the sound of the partitions squeaking
under pressure.

But...


119 :
But... there was something that I heard in the
gaps between the siren.

It sounded like rain.

Like water droplets pouring down on water and
the sound of the wind cutting through the sky.


120 :

{C3A484}
[£o¢o]
What? What is that sound?

A winded £o¢o asked me that.

We were getting closer to the sound of the
rain.

A low sound, it drowned out the sound of the
siren.

Left of the corridor stood a gaping
entranceway...

Dashing into it, our eyes met with a
surprising sight.


121 :
Fwwwaaaaaaaashhhh...

Massive amounts of water rained down from the
ceiling.

It was the rest area.

The whole area was obscured in a fine mist...

And smack in the middle of it...


122 :

{C3A485}
[£o¢o]
S-Sora-san!

Sora was shining like a rainbow.

We worked our way toward Sora through the
rain, trying to avoid the moisture as much as
possible.

£o¢o and I were already drenched.

[Takeshi]
Sora, what in the world...?

Sora looked up at the ceiling.

I followed her gaze and looked upward.

Among the countless drops of mist...

Something was faintly visible on the other
side.

[Takeshi]
Sprinklers?


{C3A486}
[Sora]
Heehee...

Sora just laughed. She didn't try to answer.

Just then...


{C3A487}
[Y¤u]
H-hey, what's happening!?

Y¤u frantically came running into the room.

She was holding a fire extinguisher in her
hands.

She had already removed the safety pin, aimed
the nozzle, and was ready to let loose with it.


It was a pretty clumsy-looking attempt.


123 :

{C3A488}
[Sora]
I apologize for causing you undue worry.


{C3A489}
[Sora]
I felt sorry for them, so I...


{C3A490}
[£o¢o]
Felt sorry?

Sora turned her gaze to the flowerbeds on the
ground.

[Takeshi]
Was this... all just to water the flowers...?


{C3A491}
[Sora]
Hehe...

Sora just smiled. She didn't try to explain.


{C3A492}
[Y¤u]
"There isn't a fire, or an explosion, or 
anything like that?"


{C3A493}
[Sora]
Correct...


{C3A494}
[Sora]
I am very sorry.

But Sora's face didn't look like she was sorry.

Rather, it looked like Sora was enjoying the
droplets showering down from the sprinklers.


{C3A495}
[Y¤u]
Geez, don't scare me like that...


{C3A496}
[Y¤u]
"The monitor in the security room showed a fire 
alarm, so I came running..."

Y¤u replaced the nozzle of the fire
extinguisher and the safety pin.

[Takeshi]
"Well, at least it was nothing serious. 
Better than the alternative."


{C3A497}
[Y¤u]
I suppose...


{C3A498}
[£o¢o]
Yeah...

£o¢o, Y¤u, and I heaved a sigh and sat down
where we were.

The sprinklers hadn't stopped.

Sora was staring at the flowers with a look
of pity.

It looked as if the grass and flowers were
dancing, reveling in the newfound moisture.


{C3A499}
[£o¢o]
Hey? What happened to Kiddo and Pipi?

I looked around the room.

I saw them.

The Kid and Pipi were still running around the
statues.


{C3A500}
[Kid]
It's raining~ It's pouring~


{PIPI_10}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!


{C3A501}
[Kid]
The old man is snoring~


{PIPI_18}
[Pipi]
*Bowwww*!


{C3A502}
[Kid]
"And I'm singing in the rain~ Because I like 
the rain~"


{PIPI_02}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


{C3A503}
[Kid]
Delicious rain! *Gulp*, *gulp*, *gulp*!


{C3A504}
[Kid]
"What a glorious feeling~ But I don't wanna 
catch a cold~"


{PIPI_20}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof*!


{C3A505}
[Kid]
I'm going to get you now!


{C3A506}
[Kid]
It's an acid rain shower!


{PIPI_16}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow-wow*, *bow-wow-wow*!


{C3A507}
[Kid]
"I'm singing in the rain~ What a glorious 
feeling~"


{PIPI_21}
[Pipi]
*Woooof*, *wooof*!

The Kid and Pipi were running about in the
downpour, screaming out joyfully.

It went beyond playfulness. It was close to
pathological.

(I wonder if the Kid has finally taken the
plunge off the deep end...)

I clasped my hands together as if praying for
his recovery.


124 :

{C3A508}
[Kid]
"Rain, rain, don't go away, come again 
some other day~"


{PIPI_18}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


{C3A509}
[Kid]
"Not a sprinkle, but a shower~ An excuse to 
get drenched and skip school~"


{PIPI_03}
[Pipi]
*Woof*?


{C3A510}
[Kid]
"*Gulp*, *gulp*, *gulp*... Delicious rain. Used to 
make beer~"


{C3A511}
[Kid]
"*Hic*, *hic*, *hic*... But if I drink it, the police will 
come~"


{PIPI_22}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!


{C3A512}
[Kid]
Time to run! Gotta escape!


{C3A513}
[Kid]
And don't forget the umbrella~


{PIPI_16}
[Pipi]
*Woowooowooof*! *Woowooowooof*!


{C3A514}
[Kid]
"I'm singing in the rain~ What a glorious 
feeling~"


{PIPI_20}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!


{C3A515}
[Kid]
"Rain, rain~ Sweeeeet rain~ Come again another 
day~"
