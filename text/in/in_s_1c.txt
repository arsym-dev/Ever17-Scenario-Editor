1 :
We arrived at Zweiter Stock...

And when we did, a voice came from the speaker
above the corridor.


{S1C000}
[Sora]
Right now, Komachi-san...


{S1C001}
[Sora]
...Seems to be in the security office.

I figured Sora was using the complex's
intercom system to announce
Tsugumi's location.

2 :

{S1C002}
[Takeshi]
Got it. The security office, huh?

Takeshi said that toward the ceiling.


3 :
On the way to the office...

Y¤u said...


4 :

{S1C003}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari, I've got an idea...


5 :

{S1C004}
[Takeshi]
?


{S1C005}
[Y¤u]
"I think this kinda thing is, well, better 
with just girls."


6 :

{S1C006}
[Takeshi]
Just girls?


7 :

{S1C007}
[Y¤u]
I think just Mayo and I should go.


8 :

{S1C008}
[Y¤u]
"That way, it might be easier to talk to 
Tsugumi..."


9 :

{S1C009}
[Y¤u]
Mayo, you're okay with that, yeah?


{S1C010}
[Sara]
Sure, I'm fine with that.

[Kid]
Why can't Takeshi and I come along?


10 :

{S1C011}
[Y¤u]
"This kinda thing gets messy when there are 
guys around."


11 :

{S1C012}
[Sara]
"Four against one triggers fear, you know? 
Fight or flight reactions."


12 :

{S1C013}
[Y¤u]
That and... let's call it female intuition.

[Kid]
Intuition?


13 :

{S1C014}
[Y¤u]
"I've got a hunch that Mayo and I can fix this 
misunderstanding."


14 :

{S1C015}
[Takeshi]
Misunderstanding, huh...?


15 :

{S1C016}
[Y¤u]
"That's what it is, isn't it? We haven't done 
anything to make her angry, so..."

[Kid]
That's true.

[Kid]
"It might be better to just let the two girls 
go instead of going in a group."

For some reason, I didn't have any confidence
in my ability to get Tsugumi to open up to us,
and I was sure that type of thing wasn't one
of Takeshi's strong points either.


16 :

{S1C017}
[Takeshi]
Then I guess we'll leave it up to you.


17 :
So with that, Y¤u and Sara headed to the
security office.

Takeshi and I were left in the middle of the
corridor...


18 :
...At a loss as to what to do.


{S1C018}
[Takeshi]
So... What now?

[Kid]
What do you say?


{S1C019}
[Takeshi]
Wanna wait in front of the security office?

[Kid]
"I don't think that would accomplish anything, 
but..."


{S1C020}
[Takeshi]
Then what?

[Kid]
I don't know...


19 :

{S1C021}
[Takeshi]
For now, we could take a look around.

[Kid]
I've had enough of that.


20 :

{S1C022}
[Takeshi]
Well, I haven't.

[Kid]
"Y¤u, Sara, and I walked so much that we just 
about wore holes in our shoes."

[Kid]
Zweiter Stock, Dritter Stock, everywhere.


21 :

{S1C023}
[Takeshi]
"In that case, why don't we give the 
merry-go-round a shot?"

[Kid]
"I don't know. Two guys on the 
merry-go-round sounds kinda..."


22 :

{S1C024}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


23 :

{S1C025}
[Takeshi]
"Well, anyway, I've decided to take a look 
around inside LeMU."


{S1C026}
[Takeshi]
"I'm the kind of guy that just has to see 
things with his own two eyes."


24 :
So Takeshi and I split up to search.

We agreed to meet up at 9:30 p.m.

We were to meet in front of the security
office.


25 :

{S1C027}
[Sora]
"LeMU has three layers below the ocean's 
surface."


{S1C028}
[Sora]
Erster Boden, Zweiter Stock, Dritter Stock...


{S1C029}
[Sora]
"There are seventeen meters between each floor. 
If you go down a floor, then you go seventeen 
meters deeper."


26 :

{S1C030}
[Sora]
"Thus, the third floor, Dritter Stock, is 51 
meters deep."

With all of that time on my hands, I visited
Sora in the control room.

Sora politely, and in an easy to understand way,
explained to me about LeMU, of which I was
almost entirely ignorant.


{S1C031}
[Sora]
"Outside of Dritter is a total of six atmospheres 
of pressure‡Lfive atmospheres water pressure 
and one atmosphere air pressure."


{S1C032}
[Sora]
"Even if, hypothetically, you were to suddenly 
go out into the ocean from Dritter..."


27 :

{S1C033}
[Sora]
"Your lungs would be crushed to about 
one-sixth of their size, and approximately 
five-sixths of them would be flooded. 
You would likely die in a matter of minutes."

[Kid]
Uh, can I ask a question?


28 :

{S1C034}
[Sora]
Go ahead...

[Kid]
"How much pressure, exactly, is five atmospheres 
of water pressure? It's hard to imagine..."


{S1C035}
[Sora]
"One atmosphere is one kilogram of weight per 
square centimeter."


{S1C036}
[Sora]
"The difference in pressure inside and outside 
of LeMU is five atmospheres, or a multiple of 
five. Please think of it as five kilograms of 
weight per square centimeter."

[Kid]
Five kilograms of weight per square centimeter...

[Kid]
"So for each meter, it would be 100 times 
100, or..."

[Kid]
Fifty tons!?


29 :

{S1C037}
[Sora]
That's correct.

[Kid]
B-but...

[Kid]
What about those people that skin dive?

[Kid]
"They can dive to depths of about 30 meters, 
right?"


30 :

{S1C038}
[Sora]
"The current world record for free diving is 
150 meters."


{S1C039}
[Sora]
"With an aqualung and pauses along the way, 
probably just about anyone could dive around 
35 meters."


{S1C040}
[Sora]
"However, the air sent to your lungs would be 
highly pressurized gas."


{S1C041}
[Sora]
"But with skin diving, they don't stop to 
breathe along the way. Amateurs can't 
make it past 20 meters."


{S1C042}
[Sora]
"Any deeper than that requires intensive 
training."

[Kid]
Wow. Is that right...?


31 :

{S1C043}
[Sora]
And there is one other important thing.


{S1C044}
[Sora]
"Even if you could withstand the water 
pressure..."


{S1C045}
[Sora]
"Could you really swim over 51 meters to 
the surface?"

[Kid]
51 meters?

[Kid]
How high is that? 51 meters?


32 :

{S1C046}
[Sora]
Imagine a fifteen-story building.


{S1C047}
[Sora]
"Or five three-story school buildings stacked 
on top of each other."

[Kid]
Five schools stacked...

[Kid]
No way. I couldn't swim that.


33 :

{S1C048}
[Sora]
Well, then how about a ten-story building?


{S1C049}
[Sora]
"The depth of Zweiter Stock only amounts to
34 meters."

[Kid]
34 meters...

34 :
{11:0-42}
{11:1}Even that would be impossible

{11:1}I might be able to handle that


35 :
[Kid]
I think even that would be impossible.


36 :

{S1C050}
[Sora]
I think you are probably correct.

[Kid]
"So basically, what you're trying to say is 
that we can't escape by swimming. Right, Sora?"


{S1C051}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Kid]
"I guess in the end, all we can do is wait 
for help to arrive."


37 :

{S1C052}
[Sora]
That's what it comes down to.


38 :
[Kid]
Well... somehow, I think I could...


39 :

{S1C053}
[Sora]
"What? You'd have to swim it, you know. 
This isn't walking or running."

[Kid]
"But... 34 meters... that's right over 
there..."

[Kid]
"Well, I would float... Actually, I think it 
would be easier than walking the distance 
on land."


40 :

{S1C054}
[Sora]
"You don't have any idea how severe water 
pressure is at a 34 meter depth, do you, Kid-san?"

[Kid]
Huh? N-now hold on just a minute...

[Kid]
"Just a second ago... you were talking about 
even if one could endure the water pressure."


41 :

{S1C055}
[Sora]
"That type of hypothetical talk is 
meaningless."


{S1C056}
[Sora]
"You can't discuss this problem without water 
pressure."

[Kid]
But, Sora, you said...


42 :

{S1C057}
[Sora]
Listen. Try to imagine it just one more time.


{S1C058}
[Sora]
"You are 34 meters deep... could you swim to 
the top of a ten floor building?"

There was a severe edge to Sora's way of
putting it.

I felt like there was something of a warning
contained within her words.

[Kid]
...S-Sora, you don't...

[Kid]
"You don't really think that I would try 
to break out of Zweiter Stock and swim to 
freedom, do you?"


43 :

{S1C059}
[Sora]
You wouldn't, would you?

[Kid]
Hahaha. No way.

[Kid]
"Why would I do anything that reckless and 
crazy?"


44 :

{S1C060}
[Sora]
Well, I should hope not...

[Kid]
It's fine. I understand.

[Kid]
"Right now, all we can do is patiently wait for 
help... Right?"


45 :

{S1C061}
[Sora]
That's right.

Saying that, Sora gave a big nod.


46 :
As I was so involved in my chat with Sora,
I had missed the appointed meeting time.

I left the control room and headed toward the
meeting point‡Lin front of the security
office.

But...


47 :
Takeshi was nowhere to be seen.

[Kid]
Hey! Takeshi!

I called out to him, but there was no answer.


Glancing at the door of the security office,
I saw that it was open.

I decided to take a peek inside the room.


48 :
No one was there...

Not Y¤u, Sara, nor Tsugumi.

[Kid]
Hey, Sora! Sora, everybody? Where are you?

I looked up at the bare ceiling and called out.

I figured Sora would be in the control room
monitoring me.

But apparently she wasn't...

The speakers in the ceiling remained painfully
silent.


49 :
[Kid]
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do.

I thought as I wandered walking through the
corridors.


50 :
First...

51 :
I thought I would go somewhere else.

52 :
{11:0-44}
{11:2-d0}To the merry-go-round

{11:2-d1}To the Jellyfish Gondola

{11:2-d2}To the warehouse

{11:2-d3}To the control room

{11:2-d4}To the security office


53 :


54 :
‡LThe merry-go-round.

Several dozen dolphins were connected in a
circle.

There were no horses. No carriages.
There were no children's voices.

And the blue ocean was just one paneling
of wall away...

We were all trapped in that place...


Thinking that, it was hard to believe that the
scenery spreading before me was reality.

(What... what am I doing here...?)


That thought popped into my mind.

What I was experiencing there seemed much
more bizarre to me than the fact that I'd lost
my memory.

In other words, my doubts about the past were
less than my sense of unease about the present.

I was overcome by a sense that my existence
was floating away.


55 :

{S1C062}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kid.


{S1C063}
[Y¤u]
Are you spacing out there?

Y¤u was peeking out at me from the shadow of
a rock.

[Kid]
Uh, not exactly...


56 :

{S1C064}
[Y¤u]
Really?


57 :
[Kid]
"Oh. I talked to Sara, and she said that things 
were no good with Tsugumi."


58 :

{S1C065}
[Y¤u]
Well... You could say that.

[Kid]
What exactly happened?


59 :
[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me, how were things with 
Tsugumi?"


60 :

{S1C066}
[Y¤u]
Well...


61 :

{S1C067}
[Y¤u]
In a nutshell, it was like we whiffed.

[Kid]
What do you mean?


{S1C068}
[Y¤u]
"We started with light conversation about how 
old she was, where she lived, if she was 
hungry. We were biding our time, waiting 
for the right pitch."


{S1C069}
[Y¤u]
"Ultimately... Mayo asked her straight out 'Why 
are you so mad?'..."

[Kid]
And? What did she say?


{S1C070}
[Y¤u]
I said we whiffed, right?


62 :

{S1C071}
[Y¤u]
"It was like we waited and waited for a good 
pitch. But we didn't get anything, so we swung."

[Kid]
So it was a big zero?


{S1C072}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know if it was a zero. 
But we sure didn't hit a home run."


{S1C073}
[Y¤u]
"All we can do is wait for her to get careless 
and throw the right pitch."

[Kid]
And get her out...


63 :

{S1C074}
[Y¤u]
No, get a hit.

[Kid]
?


64 :

{S1C075}
[Y¤u]
"I just wanted to get a sense... To feel what 
she is all about."


{S1C076}
[Y¤u]
"Reasons aside, there's just something 
unpleasant about being disliked."


65 :
Saying that, Y¤u started walking.

She got on the platform of the merry-go-round
and petted the fin of a dolphin.

I followed after Y¤u and jumped on the back
of a dolphin.


66 :

{S1C077}
[Y¤u]
Kid, incidentally, what were you doing here?

[Kid]
"I was looking for everyone. When I went to 
the security office, nobody was there..."

[Kid]
What about you, Y¤u? What were you doing?


{S1C078}
[Y¤u]
"I was just hanging around this area, near the 
merry-go-round."


67 :

{S1C079}
[Y¤u]
I just wanted to be alone, so...

[Kid]
Alone?

Y¤u cast a lonely look at the dolphin as she
patted its smooth skin.


68 :

{S1C080}
[Y¤u]
Hey. Why doesn't this dolphin move?

[Kid]
"Probably because it's not turned on. There 
should be an operating panel around somewhere."


{S1C081}
[Y¤u]
"You think if we turn it on, then the dolphin 
will move?"

[Kid]
Yeah, probably.


69 :

{S1C082}
[Y¤u]
"And swim in the ocean and catch fish and 
stuff?"

[Kid]
...What?


70 :

{S1C083}
[Y¤u]
I was just thinking...


{S1C084}
[Y¤u]
"Because, inside LeMU, there are dolphins and 
whales and fish and clams and octopuses. 
There are even jellyfish and sea anemones, 
but..."


{S1C085}
[Y¤u]
But none of them are real living creatures.

[Kid]
"Of course not. They were all made 
by people..."


71 :

{S1C086}
[Y¤u]
I wonder?

[Kid]
?


72 :

{S1C087}
[Y¤u]
"For example, deep in a forest, it would be 
harder to find something that's not alive 
than something that is, right?"


{S1C088}
[Y¤u]
"There are trees and grass, birds and bugs, 
soil and little living creatures inside of it. 
Everything is alive."


73 :

{S1C089}
[Y¤u]
But how about here?


{S1C090}
[Y¤u]
"The only thing that's alive in this vast 
space is us."


{S1C091}
[Y¤u]
"And they call this an underwater paradise? A 
'utopia'?"


{S1C092}
[Y¤u]
"So in this 'utopia', living things are 
outnumbered by nonliving things."


{S1C093}
[Y¤u]
Which, in a way, means we're...


{S1C094}
[Y¤u]
We're 'intruders' in this world of the dead.

Y¤u petted the dolphin.

The dolphin's deformed plastic smile didn't
move at all.

A steel rod was stuck into its belly.


[Kid]
Do you hate LeMU, Y¤u?


74 :

{S1C095}
[Y¤u]
Well...


{S1C096}
[Y¤u]
It's hard to say...


{S1C097}
[Y¤u]
It's not that I like or dislike it...

[Kid]
"But you liked it enough to start working 
here, right?"


75 :

{S1C098}
[Y¤u]
No.

[Kid]
No? You didn't?


{S1C099}
[Y¤u]
No.

[Kid]
Well, then why...?


76 :
With my question, Y¤u tilted her head.

Then she just clammed up and started wandering
around one of the dolphins.

Finally, her feet stopped, and Y¤u quietly
faced me.


77 :

{S1C100}
[Y¤u]
I'm looking for something important.

[Kid]
Something important?


{S1C101}
[Y¤u]
A clue about my father.

[Kid]
?


78 :

{S1C102}
[Y¤u]
"Actually, my father worked in the research 
and development division of LeMU."

[Kid]
Research and development?


{S1C103}
[Y¤u]
I don't know the details...


{S1C104}
[Y¤u]
"It seems like my father made the LeMMIH 
program."

[Kid]
"LeMMIH... LeMMIH? Wasn't that LeMU's central 
computer?"


{S1C105}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


79 :

{S1C106}
[Y¤u]
Of course, he didn't do it alone.


{S1C107}
[Y¤u]
"He was one of the members involved in 
developing the project."

[Kid]
Huh? Is that so...?

[Kid]
But what did you mean by 'clue'?


80 :

{S1C108}
[Y¤u]
My father...


81 :

{S1C109}
[Y¤u]
My father... disappeared one day.


82 :
[Kid]
...What?


{S1C110}
[Y¤u]
He just went missing...

[Kid]
Wh-when?


{S1C111}
[Y¤u]
He...


83 :

{S1C112}
[Y¤u]
"He's been missing as long as I can 
remember..."


{S1C113}
[Y¤u]
"It was when I was one year old, seventeen years 
ago..."

[Kid]
So you don't remember... your father?


84 :

{S1C114}
[Y¤u]
No...


{S1C115}
[Y¤u]
I've only seen pictures and movies of him...


{S1C116}
[Y¤u]
I don't really have any memories...


{S1C117}
[Y¤u]
"Everything I just told you, I heard from my 
mother..."

[Kid]
But why? Why did he disappear?


85 :

{S1C118}
[Y¤u]
If I knew that, I wouldn't have come here.

[Kid]
What do you mean?


86 :

{S1C119}
[Y¤u]
The last time my father was seen was in LeMU.


{S1C120}
[Y¤u]
"So I thought that if I came here, maybe I 
would find some clue about my father..."


{S1C121}
[Y¤u]
"It seems like my mother has already given up, 
so I can't count on her..."

[Kid]
...?


{S1C122}
[Y¤u]
"My mother has convinced herself that my father is 
already dead..."

The word 'dead' had a heavy ring to it.

Y¤u looked straight at me as her eyes watered.


87 :

{S1C123}
[Y¤u]
But, you know?


88 :

{S1C124}
[Y¤u]
I believe!


{S1C125}
[Y¤u]
I know that my dad is still alive somewhere!


{S1C126}
[Y¤u]
He has to be!


89 :

{S1C127}
[Y¤u]
"My father just went missing... and his remains 
were never found..."

I couldn't find any words.

I didn't know what to say to her.


She might have been waiting for me say
something like 'You're right! He's probably
alive somewhere!'

But I couldn't say it.

I just nodded and couldn't even look back
into her eyes.


90 :
Finally... we promised to meet later in the
conference room and split up.


91 :
‡LThe Jellyfish Gondola.

Tsugumi was there.

Her back was to me, and she was looking at the
entrance.

I called out to her loudly.

[Kid]
Want to ride the gondola?

Tsugumi turned to look at me.

But she immediately turned on her heel and
walked away.

[Kid]
Wait a minute...


92 :

{S1C128}
[Tsugumi]
I already told you.

[Kid]
?


{S1C129}
[Tsugumi]
I said don't ever talk to me again.

[Kid]
But...


93 :
Tsugumi started walking again.

[Kid]
Hey! I said wait!


94 :

{S1C130}
[Tsugumi]
What is it!? You're so irritating!

[Kid]
You met Y¤u and Sara, right?


95 :

{S1C131}
[Tsugumi]
So what?


96 :
[Kid]
What did you talk about?


97 :
[Kid]
Why didn't you listen to them?


98 :

{S1C132}
[Tsugumi]
It's none of your business...


99 :

{S1C133}
[Tsugumi]
Is that why you stopped me?

[Kid]
No...

[Kid]
The real reason is something else...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
"Before, you said something about 'those guys' 
or something, right?"

[Kid]
What... did you mean by that?


100 :
Tsugumi stared at me intently.

She narrowed her eyes almost as if she was
appraising me.

Intimidated by her intense glare, my body
stiffened, and I swallowed.


101 :

{S1C134}
[Tsugumi]
What is with you...?

[Kid]
I don't know.

[Kid]
I wish I did know...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Tsugumi]
...............

[Kid]
...............


102 :

{S1C135}
[Tsugumi]
Fine.


{S1C136}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, if you aren't lying... then I'll 
warn you about one thing."


103 :

{S1C137}
[Tsugumi]
You are... just being used by them.

[Kid]
U-using me?

[Kid]
"So... So who do you mean when you say 
those guys?"


104 :

{S1C138}
[Tsugumi]
I can't say more than that.


{S1C139}
[Tsugumi]
I still don't trust you 100% yet.


105 :

{S1C140}
[Tsugumi]
And I don't want you trusting me either...

[Kid]
.........


106 :

{S1C141}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, look after yourself.


{S1C142}
[Tsugumi]
"If something happens, I'm not going to 
help you..."


107 :
Saying only that, Tsugumi turned and left.

Having no idea what had just happened,
I simply stood there.


108 :
I wound up in front of the warehouse.

(I don't expect anybody is here, but...)

(...What's that?)

The watertight door at the entrance was
slightly open.

I was sure it was closed when I had come
by there with Y¤u and everyone.

[Kid]
Is anyone there?

I softly opened the door.


109 :

{S1C143}
[Sara]
Ah.

[Kid]
Huh? Sara?

Sara was inside.

She was sitting on top of a pile of boxes.

I didn't know if I'd surprised her,
but her face seemed to stiffen.


110 :

{S1C144}
[Sara]
Oh, Kid... Don't scare me like that.

[Kid]
S-sorry...

After shooting me a slight glare, Sara stuck
her hands in her pockets and dropped to the
floor.

[Kid]
But what are you doing here?


111 :

{S1C145}
[Sara]
Huh? Oh... I just wanted some time alone.

[Kid]
Alone?


112 :
(Y¤u had said almost the same thing...)

[Kid]
What happened with Tsugumi?


{S1C146}
[Sara]
Nothing, really.

[Kid]
Well, you seem pretty down...


113 :

{S1C147}
[Sara]
"In the end, she didn't tell us anything. 
We were just running in circles... and it wore 
me out..."

[Kid]
I see...


114 :

{S1C148}
[Sara]
"Actually, Nakkyu said that she wanted to be 
alone, so we just went our separate ways."

[Kid]
Hmmm.

[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me, how were things with 
Tsugumi?"


115 :
[Sara]
...

Sara sighed slightly and held her hands out,
palms facing up.

[Kid]
I see...


116 :
Feminine intuition aside, not even the two
girls had been able to get through to her.
Even though there was no apparent reason for
Tsugumi to hold a grudge...

What could Tsugumi have been so angry with
us about?


117 :
Finally... we promised to meet later in the
conference room and split up.


118 :
I went to the control room again.

[Kid]
What's up? Any progress?


119 :

{S1C149}
[Sora]
Unfortunately, no...


{S1C150}
[Sora]
"It appears that even LeMMIH is not able to 
accurately gauge the situation."


{S1C151}
[Sora]
"This is... It is something that would 
normally be unthinkable."


120 :
[Kid]
Oh, that reminds me. Sora, did you know...?


121 :

{S1C152}
[Sora]
Know? Know what?

[Kid]
That Y¤u's father made LeMMIH.


122 :

{S1C153}
[Sora]
Huh? Is that right? That's... news to me.

[Kid]
Of course, he didn't make it all by himself.

[Kid]
"She said her dad was a member of the 
development project team."


{S1C154}
[Sora]
Is that right...?


123 :

{S1C155}
[Sora]
That's very interesting.


124 :
I turned my eyes to the massive monitor behind
Sora.

A flat map of LeMU's Zweiter Stock and Dritter
Stock floors was displayed.

LeMMIH was monitoring LeMU, wall-to-wall,
24 hours a day.

If LeMMIH couldn't survey the situation, then
what in the world...?


125 :
[Kid]
By the way... Why is LeMMIH called 'LeMMIH'?


126 :

{S1C156}
[Sora]
Oh, haven't I told you?

[Kid]
No. I haven't heard...


127 :

{S1C157}
[Sora]
LeMMIH's proper name is...


128 :

{S1C158A}
[Sora]
"<Leiblich Medizin: Multiverfahren{1}

{S1C158B}
Intelligentes Hirnsystem.>{1}

{S1C158C}
...That is its name."

129 :
[Kid]
"Uh... what was that? Can you give it to me one 
more time?"


130 :

{S1C159A}
[Sora]
"<Leiblich Medizin: Multiverfahren{1}

{S1C159B}
Intelligentes Hirnsystem.>{1}

{S1C159C}
...That is its name."

131 :
[Kid]
What language is that?


{S1C160}
[Sora]
It's German.

[Kid]
What does it mean?


132 :

{S1C161A}
[Sora]
"The first part,

{S1C161B}
<Leiblich Medizin>, indicates{1}

{S1C161C}
the name of a pharmaceutical company."

133 :

{S1C162}
[Sora]
"The bit after that means something along the 
lines of 'parallel processing artificial 
intelligence system'."


{S1C163}
[Sora]
"The first letter of each word created the 
acronym 'LeMMIH', so they called the 
system 'LeMMIH'."

[Kid]
Uh-huh... I see.

[Kid]
"Hey, there are two things I wanted to 
ask you..."


134 :

{S1C164}
[Sora]
What might they be?

[Kid]
That Leibl... Uh... What was it again?


135 :

{S1C165}
[Sora]
"<Leiblich Medizin>... In Japan, it is known as 
Leiblich Pharmaceuticals."

[Kid]
"So what is the relationship between Leiblich 
and LeMU?"


{S1C166}
[Sora]
"The company managing this theme park is 
called LeMU."


{S1C167}
[Sora]
"And the largest stockholder is Leiblich 
Pharmaceuticals."

[Kid]
I see...

[Kid]
"So essentially, I guess that Leiblich has the 
right to say whatever happens at LeMU."


136 :

{S1C168}
[Sora]
"I suppose that is a reasonable 
interpretation."


137 :

{S1C169}
[Sora]
The origin of the name of this theme park...


{S1C170}
[Sora]
"The official line is that it was named 
after the phantom continent Lemuria."


{S1C171}
[Sora]
"But actually, I've heard that it is just a 
combination of the first letters of <Leiblich 
Medizin> and <utopie>."


{S1C172}
[Sora]
<Utopie> means 'utopia'.


138 :

{S1C173}
[Sora]
"In other words, Leiblich created this place 
to be a dream-like utopia..."


{S1C174}
[Sora]
So that is why they named it that.

[Kid]
A utopia, huh...?


139 :

{S1C175}
[Sora]
And what was your second question?

[Kid]
Uh, well...

[Kid]
It's about German...


140 :

{S1C176}
[Sora]
German?

[Kid]
Yeah.

[Kid]
"You just said that LeMMIH's official name is 
German, right?"

[Kid]
"And all around LeMU are these German signs 
and stuff..."

[Kid]
I just... I wondered why German...


141 :

{S1C177}
[Sora]
"That's because Leiblich Pharmaceuticals is a 
joint venture between a Japanese and a 
German company."


{S1C178}
[Sora]
"Its headquarters are in Frankfurt and the 
majority of officials are German."

[Kid]
So that's why it's all in German...

[Kid]
"So Leiblich Pharmaceuticals has a pretty 
strong relationship with LeMU, then?"

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
Since I'm asking, can I ask one more thing?


142 :

{S1C179}
[Sora]
Go ahead.

[Kid]
"Why did Leiblich Pharmaceuticals want to run a 
theme park anyhow?"

[Kid]
"I mean, we're talking about Leiblich 
Pharmaceuticals. They make medicine, right? 
That doesn't seem to have anything to do 
with a theme park."

[Kid]
"And, and this is right in the middle of the 
ocean, right? Why go to all of the 
trouble of..."


143 :

{S1C180}
[Sora]
Because...


{S1C181}
[Sora]
Because...


{S1C182}
[Sora]
I'm sorry.


{S1C183}
[Sora]
I can't answer that question.

[Kid]
...What...? Why not?


144 :

{S1C184}
[Sora]
It is confidential information.


145 :
[Kid]
Confidential?

[Kid]
Haha. What in the...

[Kid]
Who could I possibly tell?

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
"I can't imagine that a 'kid' like me finding 
out could cause any damage."

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
You really can't even tell little old me?

[Sora]
.........

Sora had gone quiet and wasn't answering.


[Kid]
Okay. I understand.

[Kid]
We'll just forget about it...


146 :

{S1C185}
[Sora]
I'm really sorry.

[Kid]
It's alright. You don't have to apologize...

[Kid]
"You have to keep the secret as part of your 
job, right? There's nothing you can do about 
it..."

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Sora]
...............

[Kid]
...............


147 :

{S1C186}
[Sora]
Alright. I'll tell you one thing.


148 :

{S1C187}
[Sora]
"LeMU does not rely on energy provided from 
the outside, but generates all of its energy 
in this complex."


{S1C188}
[Sora]
"And directly under us, at a depth of 119 
meters, is the seafloor..."


149 :

{S1C189}
[Sora]
"There is a thermal vent on the surface of the 
sea floor where water of several hundred 
degrees is pumped out, and heat from that is used 
to operate generators."


150 :
I waited for the rest of the explanation.

But Sora didn't say anything more.

[Kid]
"And? What does that have to do with what we 
were just talking about?"

Sora let the question go...


151 :

{S1C190}
[Sora]
Do you mind if I get back to work?

[Kid]
Oh? Uh... Sorry to bother you.

[Sora]
.........

I gave up and left.


152 :
LeMU was controlled by a Japanese-German joint
venture called Leiblich Pharmaceuticals...

Why would they build a theme park?


And what could it have to do with the fact
that they generated their own energy...?

I left with that mystery spinning in my mind.


153 :
(Oh... Takeshi!)

I was surprised upon returning to the security
office.

Takeshi was there.

(I wonder what he's up to...)

He had both hands on the operating panel and
was staring into the monitor intently.

I was about to call out to him...

But I hesitated.

The gaze that Takeshi had leveled on the
monitor...

It was so intense that it made my spine
tingle...

He had the eyes of a hawk scouring the
horizon for prey.

[Kid]
...Take... shi...

I finally got out the words.

Takeshi slowly looked back at me.

[Kid]
.........


154 :

{S1C191}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Kid, you finally made it. I'm beat from 
waiting."

The look on Takeshi's face was his normal old
goofy expression.

I felt relieved.

[Kid]
"What were you doing? You looked so intense 
that it was scary."


155 :

{S1C192}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Scary?

[Kid]
Yeah. Just now. You looked scary.


156 :

{S1C193}
[Takeshi]
"That's kind of rude. What's so scary about 
my face?"

[Kid]
It's different now, but before it was scary.


157 :

{S1C194}
[Takeshi]
Then how about you show me how scary it was?

[Kid]
Huh? Uh... Um...

[Kid]
"I think your face was kind of like 
this... Glaring at the monitor..."

I tried to mimic how Takeshi had looked by
using my fingers to pull up both of my eyes.


158 :

{S1C195}
[Takeshi]
GAHAHAHA... That? That's not scary at all.

[Kid]
Don't try to pretend it was nothing!


{S1C196}
[Takeshi]
Oh, sorry, sorry. I...


159 :

{S1C197}
[Takeshi]
...I was looking for you, my dear.

[Kid]
For me?


{S1C198}
[Takeshi]
"Because you never showed up. I thought 
I'd call you on the complex intercom system."

[Kid]
Huh?


{S1C199}
[Takeshi]
"I figured you were probably lost somewhere 
and crying yourself silly..."

[Kid]
"What are you talking about? I was about to 
say the same thing to you!"

[Kid]
"You weren't here at the time we set up. Where 
have you been until now?"


160 :

{S1C200}
[Takeshi]
"Stupid! You're the one that wasn't here, 
right? You're totally late."

[Kid]
"Oh... Sorry... about that. B-but you could have 
waited a little longer."


161 :

{S1C201}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, I'm a busy guy. I'm not here to look 
after you."

[Kid]
Busy...? You?


{S1C202}
[Takeshi]
Yup. I'm horribly busy.

[Kid]
"Liar. Until a while ago, we were wasting 
time together."


162 :

{S1C203}
[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
.........


{S1C204}
[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
..............


163 :

{S1C205}
[Takeshi]
...Hey.

[Kid]
?


{S1C206}
[Takeshi]
Can we stop this meaningless conversation?

[Kid]
Y-yeah. It is kind of stupid.


164 :

{S1C207}
[Takeshi]
Isn't it?

We both laughed wryly.

That dissolved any tension that was in the
atmosphere.

I didn't get it...

But at some point, I had begun to feel
comfortable with him.

I thought there was something about
him... Something like me, maybe...


165 :

{S1C208}
[Takeshi]
"So how's your condition coming along? 
Any changes?"

Saying that, Takeshi sat down in a chair.

His eyes were at the same height as mine.

[Kid]
Any changes... You mean my memory?

Takeshi nodded.

I shook my head.


166 :

{S1C209}
[Takeshi]
I see.


167 :

{S1C210}
[Takeshi]
"Well, don't force it. It's like Sora said. 
Memory loss can be totally cured with 
no warning."

[Kid]
Easy for you to say. It's not your problem...


168 :

{S1C211}
[Takeshi]
Sure. It's not my problem.

[Kid]
You say it like you've seen it happen.


169 :

{S1C212}
[Takeshi]
Well, I've been around the block a few times.

[Kid]
Sure, sure... Tell me about it.

I didn't feel like prying.


170 :

{S1C213}
[Takeshi]
"Well, for now... why don't you just try to 
remember things, starting with stuff familiar 
to you?"


{S1C214}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, things like your birthday...

(My birthday...)

[Kid]
.........


171 :

{S1C215}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What's wrong?

[Kid]
Hey, what year is it?


172 :

{S1C216}
[Takeshi]
You forgot that, too?

[Kid]
Yeah...


173 :

{S1C217}
[Takeshi]
It's 20...


174 :

{S1C218}
[Takeshi]
...Uh, what year IS it?

Saying that, Takeshi fished his entrance ticket
stub from his pocket...


175 :

{S1C219}
[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right.


{S1C220}
[Takeshi]
It's 2017.

Takeshi crumpled the stub back up and pushed
it back into his pocket.

[Kid]
2017...


176 :

{S1C221}
[Takeshi]
Is there something up with that?

[Kid]
Yeah, kind of.


177 :

{S1C222}
[Takeshi]
Kind of?

[Kid]
"I thought that if I heard the year, then 
I might be able to remember at least 
my birthday."


{S1C223}
[Takeshi]
"I see. Come to think of it, you don't even 
know how old you are, huh?"

[Kid]
No...


178 :

{S1C224}
[Takeshi]
"By the looks of it, I'd say you're not 
a day over 42."

[Kid]
What!?


179 :

{S1C225}
[Takeshi]
HAHAHA. I'm kidding! Relax!


180 :

{S1C226}
[Takeshi]
There's no way.


{S1C227}
[Takeshi]
"You're probably in the neighborhood
of fourteen or fifteen."


{S1C228}
[Takeshi]
If you're eighteen, then you've got a baby face.

[Kid]
Fourteen or fifteen, huh...?

I muttered that.


181 :

{S1C229}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I'm getting out of here. Actually, 
I haven't finished looking around."

[Kid]
"Oh hey, Takeshi! It seems like everybody is 
scattered all over right now..."


182 :

{S1C230}
[Takeshi]
"Yeah? We'll have to arrange to meet somewhere 
sooner or later."

[Kid]
I think the conference room would be good.


{S1C231}
[Takeshi]
"Got it. If I see the others, then 
I'll give 'em the word."


183 :
Takeshi left.

I also decided to go somewhere else.


184 :
On the way down the corridor...

I noticed a sound.

I looked for the source of the sound.

Someone was crossing the corridor where it
came to a T ahead of me.

A girl!?

It was a girl that I had never seen before.

I followed after her as if
I were being pulled in by her.

[Kid]
Hey! Hey! Wait! You there!


185 :
The girl went into the infirmary.


186 :
No one was inside...

I carefully crept toward the rear of the room.

I noticed a squarish hole cut out of the floor.


I peeked inside.

Down below, a small lift was stopped.

It appeared that there was another room
directly below the infirmary.

I pushed the button calling the lift
and hopped in.


187 :
In the darkness, a girl sat on a bed.


188 :
[Kid]
Uh, um... I...

I was at a loss for words.

I didn't know where to start.

[Young Girl]
.........

The girl just stared at me intently.

[Kid]
It's... al-alright...

[Kid]
Don't worry... Everything is alright...

She didn't answer.

[Kid]
Uh... Um...

[Kid]
Anyway, let's go to where everybody else is!


{S1C232}
[Young Girl]
Everybody?

[Kid]
Yeah, it's not just me.

[Kid]
There are lots of other people...


{S1C233}
[Young Girl]
Help...? Did you come to help?

[Kid]
Y-yeah... That's right.


189 :

{S1C234}
[Young Girl]
But... it's probably impossible...

[Kid]
Huh?


{C1S299}
[Young Girl]
There is... no way out anymore...

The girl's eyes were sad and moist.

[Kid]
Why do you say that?

[Kid]
"We'll be fine! A rescue team should be here 
any time!"


190 :

{S1C236}
[Young Girl]
Liar...

[Kid]
It's not a lie!

[Kid]
"The people who escaped know that we're 
here..."

[Kid]
Someone will come for sure!

[Young Girl]
.........

[Kid]
Why are you saying that's wrong?


{S1C237}
[Young Girl]
Because... Because...

191 :
Then, suddenly, a shocked look appeared on the
girl's face as her eyes focused behind me.

I followed her gaze.


192 :
On the other side of the door... was Takeshi,
peeking in.


193 :

{S1C238}
[Takeshi]
Who are you talking to?

[Kid]
Takeshi! What great timing...!

[Kid]
"It seems like this girl here didn't get out 
either..."


194 :

{S1C239}
[Takeshi]
Girl?


{S1C240}
[Takeshi]
What girl...?


195 :

{S1C241}
[Takeshi]
...There's nobody there.

[Kid]
Huh!?


196 :
I looked back.

The girl had vanished, and there was no sign
that anyone had been sitting where she had
been.

[Kid]
Im-impossible...


197 :

{S1C242}
[Takeshi]
"Stop it already. What? Are you tired of 
memory loss and working on hallucinations now?"


{S1C243}
[Takeshi]
You're worse off than we thought...

[Kid]
No! No! I'm not seeing things!

[Kid]
"There was a girl here! She was sitting on 
this bed!"


198 :

{S1C244}
[Takeshi]
Listen, Kid...

[Kid]
Wh-what...?


199 :

{S1C245}
[Takeshi]
Aren't you hungry?

[Kid]
Hungry...?

[Kid]
Wh-who cares about that right now?

[Kid]
There was a girl here... A girl, I tell you...


200 :

{S1C246}
[Takeshi]
I know, I know.


{S1C247}
[Takeshi]
There was a girl there. I heard you...

[Kid]
You don't get it at all!


{S1C248}
[Takeshi]
"Alright, alright. I'll listen to the whole 
story later."

[Kid]
But...


201 :

{S1C249}
[Takeshi]
"But nothing! You're going to piss me off 
if you keep this up!"


202 :

{S1C250}
[Takeshi]
"Everyone is waiting for you... to eat 
together..."

[Kid]
"Well, then, what are we going to do about 
the girl!?"

[Kid]
"I'm sure the girl is probably starving 
too..."


203 :

{S1C251}
[Takeshi]
Oh man... You've completely lost it...

[Kid]
I'm not crazy!

[Kid]
There was a girl... A girl... Right here...

In the end, I couldn't get Takeshi to listen
to me.


204 :
Before going to the conference room, I peeked
into the control room.

The bio scan figure was eating at my mind.


205 :
'Life readings: 5'

The number had dropped from six to five.


206 :
Everyone was in the conference room.

There were fried tuna sandwiches and drinks
secured from the sandwich shop for everyone.

Only Tsugumi was absent.

I wondered where she had gone... but more
than that, I was worried about her.

I told everyone about the girl.

But...

Everyone just laughed, and not one of them listened.

No one else had seen the girl.

Then I remembered the bio scan figure.


207 :
'7'

That girl was probably person number seven.

But the number had been five and six as well.


208 :
What could it mean?

The image of the girl had been burned into
my mind, and there was no getting away from it.

I wondered if it was, like Takeshi had
said, a hallucination.

If not, then... a ghost?

Haha. That was crazy...

I shook my head at my own silliness.

Maybe I was losing it...

Something had to be wrong with me.

I needed to calm down and collect myself.

While I thought that, I flipped up the tab on
the can of cola.


209 :
Fushaaaww!

At first, I didn't know what had happened.

I licked the liquid around my lips.

It was sweet.

It seemed as if the cola had exploded
into my face.


210 :

{S1C252}
[Sara]
KYAHAHAHA~


{S1C253}
[Y¤u]
AHHAHAHA~


{S1C254}
[Sora]
FUFUFUFUFU~


{S1C255}
[Everyone]
GAHAHAHAHA~

Everyone exploded in a chorus of laughter.


211 :

{S1C256}
[Y¤u]
Hey, what the heck are you doing, Kid?

Y¤u said that, laughing.


{S1C257}
[Y¤u]
"These cans contain special gas so that they can 
be used at six atmospheres."


{S1C258}
[Y¤u]
But right now, we're at one atmosphere, right?


{S1C259}
[Y¤u]
"So if you don't hold it down when you open 
it, the soda inside explodes..."


212 :
As she laughed, Sara took out a handkerchief.

I took it and wiped my face.

I was enveloped in laughter...

Without noticing, I'd forgotten about
everything that had been weighing on my mind.


213 :
Almost an hour had passed.

No help had come. There was no contact.

The people on the floating island should have
known that we were all trapped down below.

So why didn't anyone come?

Even if they couldn't open the watertight
doors, there should have been divers that could
tap on the window glass or something...


214 :

{S1C260}
[Sora]
"Everyone, I think it is best that we go to 
sleep this evening."


215 :

{S1C261}
[Sora]
Please leave the rest to me.

Saying that, Sora grinned.


216 :

{S1C262}
[Takeshi]
Sleep... But where?


{S1C263}
[Sara]
Are there any places to lie down or anything?


217 :

{S1C264}
[Sora]
"In the sectors that were submerged in water, 
but unfortunately not in the dry areas..."


218 :

{S1C265}
[Sora]
"Instead, I have prepared another place for 
you."


219 :
[Kid]
Another...


220 :

{S1C266}
[Y¤u]
...Place?


221 :

{S1C267}
[Y¤u]
Wa-wait a second, Sora!

[Kid]
"You're not saying that four people have to 
sleep in this cramped space?"

It was the place was where I had seen the girl.


222 :

{S1C268}
[Sara]
What is this room anyway?


223 :

{S1C269}
[Sora]
Let me explain.


{S1C270}
[Sora]
"This is a decompression room for medical 
purposes."


{S1C271}
[Sora]
"Here, people suffering from decompression 
sickness, or the bends, are treated."


224 :

{S1C272}
[Takeshi]
The bends?


225 :

{S1C273}
[Sora]
Yes.


{S1C274}
[Sora]
"Normally, when people leave LeMU, they spend an 
extended period of time going through 
decompression and adjusting from six atmospheres 
to one atmosphere."


{S1C275}
[Sora]
"However, as a result of the accident, 
everyone has experienced a sudden change 
in pressure."


{S1C276}
[Sora]
You may be suffering from the bends.


226 :

{S1C277}
[Sora]
"So, just to be safe, I want to have everyone 
undergo repressurization in this room..."

[Kid]
But... there's nothing wrong with us.


{S1C278}
[Sora]
"In cases of light decompression sickness, 
you are not necessarily aware of it 
immediately."


{S1C279}
[Sora]
"There are cases where the pain doesn't start 
for a day or two."


227 :

{S1C280}
[Takeshi]
"After you figure out you're in trouble, 
it's too late...?"


228 :

{S1C281}
[Sora]
Correct.


{S1C282}
[Sora]
"In other words, this is just to be completely 
safe."


229 :

{S1C283}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Sora. What about the... uh, that thing...
in the infirmary?"


{S1C284}
[Y¤u]
"Wasn't there some device that can diagnose 
medical conditions?"


230 :

{S1C285}
[Sora]
Do you mean the L-MRI?


231 :

{S1C286}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, yeah, that's it.


232 :

{S1C287}
[Y¤u]
"If you do a scan with that, can't we tell 
for sure if it's decompression sickness?"


233 :

{S1C288}
[Sora]
Unfortunately, no, we cannot.


234 :

{S1C289}
[Y¤u]
Really? Why not?


{S1C290}
[Sora]
"As you saw before, that device is out of 
order. Discovering the problem and repairing 
it would take time and energy."


235 :

{S1C291}
[Y¤u]
Oh, really...


236 :

{S1C292}
[Sara]
Sora, can I ask you something?


237 :

{S1C293}
[Sora]
What?


{S1C294}
[Sara]
"I want to know more about this decompression 
sickness..."


238 :

{S1C295}
[Sora]
I see.


239 :

{S1C296}
[Sora]
"Decompression sickness occurs when there is a 
sudden change in the surrounding air pressure 
and gas bubbles that can't be discharged 
accrue in the body."


{S1C297}
[Sora]
"Gas becomes air bubbles, and these gather 
in tissues or veins."


{S1C298}
[Sora]
"When gas bubbles remain inside the body, 
the oxygen respiration efficiency drops 
dramatically."


240 :

{S1C299}
[Takeshi]
"So... No matter how many deep breaths you 
take, it feels like you're suffocating?"


241 :

{S1C300}
[Sora]
Yes.


242 :

{S1C301}
[Sora]
"So we will seal this room and pump in a high 
concentration of oxygen, slowly taking it up to 
approximately three atmospheres..."


{S1C302}
[Sora]
"After that, we slowly decompress it back down to 
one atmosphere."


{S1C303}
[Sora]
"Using this difference in pressure, we 
dissolve the gas bubbles in your body 
back into the blood, where you get 
rid of them naturally by breathing."


243 :

{S1C304}
[Takeshi]
"So basically, you make us like a can of cola 
that won't blow up..."


244 :

{S1C305}
[Sora]
Yes, precisely.


245 :

{S1C306}
[Takeshi]
Okay, I got it.


246 :
The decompression process took place over
several hours.

But boy, it was... cramped...


247 :
I wondered where in the world Tsugumi could
have gone.


248 :
And shouldn't Sora have been undergoing
decompression as well?


249 :
I was so tired that my mind and body felt
numb, but strangely, sleep didn't come for me.

Takeshi had monopolized the bed.

He was breathing deeply and peacefully.

Sleeping so well in an emergency like that...

Y¤u, Sara, and I sat on the floor.

I gradually got annoyed with Takeshi sleeping
like a log.

There were still four hours until the
decompression was complete.

The night was long...
