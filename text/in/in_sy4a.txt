1 :
...It was a new day.

Y¤u said she was going to change clothes and
had gone up to the second floor.

Sora went back to work.

Sara... She was probably sleeping in the
compression chamber.

Takeshi was supposedly filthy drunk in the
park rest area.

Tsugumi hadn't come back. I had no idea where
she'd gone...


2 :
Me, I was in the conference room.

In the middle of the table was a
three-dimensional image of LeMU.

I was staring at it and trying to come up with
escape plans.

At that point, I hadn't even hit upon a single
one.

Any plan would fall apart before I even got it
fully developed because of my limited
knowledge.

But I didn't intend to give up.

I thought if I could just find a starting
point...

I wanted to get back at Y¤u somehow.


3 :
The door opened, and somebody came in.

Looking back... I saw that it was Y¤u.

She had changed into her work uniform.


4 :

{Y4A000}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, so this is where you are. I was looking 
for you."

The ribbon on her outfit shook rhythmically as
she walked toward me.


5 :
[Kid]
Are your clothes dry?


{Y4A001}
[Y¤u]
Nope. The dryer is broken.


{Y4A002}
[Y¤u]
These clothes will do for a while anyway.

[Kid]
Hmmm.


6 :

{Y4A003}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, what are you doing with that LeMU 
hologram?"

[Kid]
Just looking.


{Y4A004}
[Y¤u]
"You aren't trying to think of a way out, are 
you?"

[Kid]
Well, all I've got is time on my hands.

I lied to her.

Embarrassed, I couldn't tell her the truth.


{Y4A005}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...

[Kid]
Enough about that. Aren't you going to sleep?


7 :

{Y4A006}
[Y¤u]
I drank too much coffee, so I can't sleep.


{Y4A007}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, there are lots of things I wanna 
think about..."

[Kid]
How about that? Same here.


{Y4A008}
[Y¤u]
What? The coffee or the thinking?

[Kid]
Both.


8 :

{Y4A009}
[Y¤u]
Wow. That's weird.

Y¤u laughed dryly as she said that.


9 :

{Y4A010}
[Y¤u]
Hey, how about keeping me company?

[Kid]
Are you going somewhere?


{Y4A011}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. Well, in order to think, you've gotta be 
in the right place to put you in the mood."

[Kid]
Someplace in mind?


{Y4A012}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, a place connected with the third eye.


10 :
The third eye.

When the third eye opens, true wisdom is
apparent, and all becomes visible.

The power of ancients. Ultimate knowledge.
Proof of a transcendental state beyond that
of normal people.

The place that Y¤u led me...

Was...


11 :

{Y4A013}
[Y¤u]
Shall we go in?

Y¤u walked toward a stone gate which rose out
of a dimly lit dome.

[Kid]
Can I ask you a question before we go in?


12 :

{Y4A014}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Sure.

[Kid]
"Why do the Lemurian Ruins have something to 
do with the third eye?"


13 :

{Y4A015}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that...


{Y4A016}
[Y¤u]
That? I lied.

[Kid]
What?


{Y4A017}
[Y¤u]
To tell you the truth, they're not related.


{Y4A018}
[Y¤u]
There's no meaning at all.


{Y4A019}
[Y¤u]
"I just thought that if I said that, then 
you'd come along with me."

[Kid]
..........


{Y4A020}
[Y¤u]
"Thinking about things all by myself doesn't 
really suit me. I need someone else around."

[Kid]
.........


14 :

{Y4A021}
[Y¤u]
Are you mad?

[Kid]
No, not really.

[Kid]
"I was just thinking that you don't seem the 
type to be governed by random illogical 
thoughts."


{Y4A022}
[Y¤u]
Really?

[Kid]
Yeah.


15 :

{Y4A023}
[Y¤u]
But actually, there might be a connection.

Y¤u turned her gaze to the ruins.


{Y4A024}
[Y¤u]
"I told you about how my mom was doing her own 
research while pretending to study the 
Lemurian continent, right?"


{Y4A025}
[Y¤u]
"It seems like she was completely hooked on 
researching the third eye."


{Y4A026}
[Y¤u]
Do you know why?

[Kid]
"Because she was conducting research in the 
name of Lemuria?"


{Y4A027}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. So my mom wanted to study the third 
eye, pretended there was a connection with 
Lemuria, and wrote about it."

'One theory has it that the people of Lemuria
were giant apes that were four meters tall...'

'They had walnut-colored skin, there were no
differences between males and females, they
laid eggs, and they communicated via telepathy.'

'And they had a third eye in the back of their
heads.'

'Telepathy and the third eye... This has
something to do with the third perspective.'

'Drawing on the idea that our vertebrate
predecessors had three eyes...'

'So the ancients‡Lespecially the Lemurians‡Lmay
well have been races that mastered the use
of this power.'

'And based on the facts discovered, I
conclude...'


{Y4A028}
[Y¤u]
'That the origin of the third eye is Lemuria.'


{Y4A029}
[Y¤u]
"She even wrote trumped-up papers on the 
topic."


{Y4A030}
[Y¤u]
"Even though they really are totally 
unrelated."

[Kid]
"I wish you'd tell me more about the third 
eye."


16 :

{Y4A031}
[Y¤u]
Sorry. I'll tell you some other time.


{Y4A032}
[Y¤u]
I don't really feel like going into it now.


17 :
Y¤u and I crossed through the gate and
entered the ruins.

It was darker inside, and the pathways were
interwoven like a maze.

The lighting was surreal, with dim lights in
some areas and bluish white lights elsewhere.

Occasionally, a hologram of some deepwater
fish would shine into view.

The ruins were also slightly flooded with
water, which had the effect of making them
appear more like ruins at the bottom of the
ocean.

............


18 :
I wondered how far we had walked.

Finally, we came to an open space kind of
like an auditorium.

The room had a high ceiling.

There were rock pillars‡Lcalled obelisks‡Lscattered
around the area. A few of them were
broken, collapsed, or crumbling.

Looking closely, I saw that a mock relief was
carved into the wall.

As I absentmindedly stared at the wall, Y¤u
walked over to one of the collapsed obelisks
and sat down, hugging her knees.


19 :

{Y4A033}
[Y¤u]
"This is a strange place, huh? It's called 
the 'Sun Temple'."

[Kid]
Sun?

That reminded me that I had seen an image of
a sun disk in the relief on the wall.


{Y4A034}
[Y¤u]
"There are a number of theories about the 
precise location of the Lemurian continent, 
but no one really knows where it was."


{Y4A035}
[Y¤u]
"But most people agree that it was located 
near the belt of tropical rainforest just 
below the equator."

Y¤u reverted to speaking like an employee
(which she was) and started giving me an
explanation of the place.


{Y4A036}
[Y¤u]
"Members of our research staff here at LeMU 
have put forth hypotheses that the people of 
Lemuria worshipped the sun..."

Y¤u paused and shrugged...


{Y4A037}
[Y¤u]
So I guess that's why we built this temple.

[Kid]
I see.

As I sat down next to Y¤u, I nodded.


{Y4A038}
[Y¤u]
"A Sun Temple... at the bottom of the 
ocean... Doesn't that strike you as 
kind of ironic?"

[Kid]
.........

I wondered if she was talking about the
continent that had sunk to the bottom of
the ocean.

Or maybe she had meant... us.


{Y4A039}
[Y¤u]
Did you think of anything?

[Kid]
What do you mean?


{Y4A040}
[Y¤u]
Ways to get out.

[Kid]
Oh...

I shook my head.


{Y4A041}
[Y¤u]
I thought so...


{Y4A042}
[Y¤u]
I can't think of any other ways.


{Y4A043}
[Y¤u]
"If we could just get that high-pressure 
inflow machine to work..."

[Kid]
.........


{Y4A044}
[Y¤u]
You know? I've thought this through.


{Y4A045}
[Y¤u]
I think we're being lied to by someone.


20 :
[Kid]
Huh? What are you talking about?


21 :

{S1C137}
[Tsugumi]
You are... just being used by them.


22 :
Tsugumi's words flashed through my mind.


{Y4A046}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, I don't think what happened here 
was just a simple accident."


{Y4A047}
[Y¤u]
"I think that somebody trapped us here on 
purpose."

[Kid]
.........


23 :

{Y4A048}
[Y¤u]
Really, it's the only thing that makes sense.


{Y4A049}
[Y¤u]
There's just too much that doesn't add up.


{Y4A050}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo's friends, Kuranari's friends, and my 
coworkers should all know that we're trapped 
here, right?"


{Y4A051}
[Y¤u]
So why doesn't anyone come?


{Y4A052}
[Y¤u]
"Even if there is some reason that they can't 
get inside, divers should at least be knocking 
on the windows!"


{Y4A053}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, we still have power. Only the 
communication system to the outside is down."


{Y4A054}
[Y¤u]
"We still don't have any idea what caused the 
alarm before the accident and the blackout..."


{Y4A055}
[Y¤u]
"And we don't know why the high-pressure intake 
fan stopped working either."


{Y4A056}
[Y¤u]
"It's almost like everything was set up to 
trap us here."

[Kid]
............

I didn't know what to say to her.

It all made sense to me.

Actually, I had been feeling the same thing.


The reason that I hadn't been able to realize it
was maybe that I didn't want to face reality.


I sneaked a looked at Y¤u's face.

She clutched her knees and turned her helpless
gaze to the water's surface.

Her lips were a bluish color, but it wasn't all
the fault of the light.

Y¤u was always more upbeat than everyone
around her.

She was a powerful presence for me.

But right then, she seemed very small and
fragile.

No matter how tough she acted, Y¤u was still
just a girl at heart.

It had been a quick three days since the
accident... It only made sense that she would
be feeling the strain.

Swallowed into the deep, dark ocean, we had
lost the warm spring sun.

(I can't let her go on like this. I have to
cheer her up somehow...)

That was how I felt deep in my heart.


24 :

{Y4A057}
[Y¤u]
Friends help each other, right?


{Y4A058}
[Y¤u]
Kid, you can see the future, can't you?


{Y4A059}
[Y¤u]
Tell me how things are going to turn out.

[Kid]
I think we'll be saved.


25 :

{Y4A060}
[Y¤u]
"Is that a premonition? Or just an optimistic 
guess?"

[Kid]
Of course, it's...

I wanted to say 'a premonition', but I couldn't.

Saying it was wouldn't work.

Y¤u could see through a lie.

I thought about it.

The third perspective.

The third eye.

True wisdom.

Omnipotent all-seeing vision.

The power to make light shine once again.

I thought that if I only had that...!

But it didn't exist. It couldn't possibly...

[Kid]
It's not a premonition... or a guess...

At the very least...


26 :
[Kid]
It's a promise.


{Y4A061}
[Y¤u]
Promise?

[Kid]
Yeah, I promise.

At least... I hoped it was.

That it was a promise that would materialize.

That we would be able to get Y¤u out of there.

I held up my hand up as if taking an oath.

I approached Y¤u... but then she spoke.


{Y4A062}
[Y¤u]
And what if... you break it?

[Kid]
I won't. I'll see that you're safe.


{Y4A063}
[Y¤u]
"For sure? There's not even a 1% chance 
you're wrong?"

[Kid]
"There is not even a 0.00000000000000001% 
possibility."

[Y¤u]
...

I pointed my finger at my heart and
promised Y¤u.


27 :

{Y4A064}
[Y¤u]
"Talk about promising more than you can 
deliver..."

I crossed my heart and hoped to die...


{Y4A065}
[Y¤u]
Oh well. I suppose I'll have to trust you.

...And stick a needle in my eye... I wouldn't
break my word to Y¤u.


28 :
The next day after breakfast, Y¤u and
I went to the security office.

She tried to access the computer network again.

I planned to stay and see her through it.

But...


29 :
Tap, tap, tap...


30 :
Tap!


31 :
Beeeeeeeep!

'Access denied. Cannot log in with the given
name at this time.'

It seemed like she still couldn't get past the
security.


32 :

{Y4A066}
[Y¤u]
Oh no. It looks like it's no good...

Y¤u's shoulders slumped dejectedly.

[Kid]
Isn't there anything else you can do?


33 :

{Y4A067}
[Y¤u]
"I could... enter by cracking the system open 
or get LeMMIH to remove the protection 
mechanism..."

[Kid]
Why don't you ask Sara?


34 :
[Y¤u]
.........

Y¤u stopped talking and looked down.

[Kid]
"Don't you want to find out what happened to 
your father?"


{Y4A068}
[Y¤u]
That...

[Kid]
"You have a right to know. There could be 
information being kept from you."

[Kid]
"So are you going to try to get at the truth, 
or are you just going to let these doubts 
nag you forever...?"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
So, Y¤u, what do you want to do?

[Kid]
In the end, it's up to you. So...

[Kid]
You should do what you want to do.

[Y¤u]
.........


35 :
Y¤u stared at her fingers... and then she
looked at the display...

...Finally her eyes drifted to the ceiling.

Y¤u gave a nod after a while.


36 :

{Y4A069}
[Y¤u]
"It might be a lot to ask, but I'll ask Mayo 
for her help."

[Kid]
Good.

She wasn't wrong. She didn't need to feel
intimidated.

[Kid]
Alright! I'll go ask her for you.


37 :
With those energetic words, I bounded out
of the security office.


38 :
As I was sprinting down the corridor...

(Wait a second... Where is Sara anyway?)

Finally, I realized something.

I should have checked on the monitor in the
security office.

But I thought I'd look stupid going all the
way back again...

I thought I might ask Sora...

But then I saw Sara cutting across the far
corridor.

I immediately went after her.


39 :
Sara went into the infirmary.

I went in after her.


40 :
[Kid]
Sara!


41 :

{Y4A070}
[Sara]
Waaaa! Geez! You scared me!

Sara jumped, startled.

[Kid]
Oh... Sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you...


42 :

{Y4A071}
[Sara]
"I'm exhausted, so cut me some slack. 
My mind and body are shot."

Sara's haggard expression told the same story.

I remembered the fight the day before with
Tsugumi.

She had probably had a sleepless night.

[Kid]
Were you thinking of going to sleep now?


43 :

{Y4A072}
[Sara]
Yup.

[Kid]
Oh...


44 :

{Y4A073}
[Sara]
Huh? Is there something wrong?

[Kid]
Actually...

I explained the details to Sara.

About Y¤u's father gone missing.

And about her working at LeMU to find clues
about his fate.

That her search was being blocked by some
protective mechanism in LeMMIH.


45 :

{Y4A074}
[Sara]
Wow. I had no idea about any of that.

[Kid]
"Yeah. Well, Y¤u and I can't figure it out 
alone."


{Y4A075}
[Sara]
So? What is it you want me to do?

[Kid]
"Well, we were hoping you could try taking out 
LeMMIH's security so that we can get into the 
network."


{Y4A076}
[Sara]
Hmmm. Cracking the security, huh...?

[Kid]
"I feel bad asking when you're so tired, 
but could you do it for her?"


46 :

{Y4A077}
[Sara]
Sure.

[Kid]
If you wouldn't mind, she'd really... Er, eh?


{Y4A078}
[Sara]
I said 'sure' already.

[Kid]
Really?


{Y4A079}
[Sara]
Yup.


47 :

{Y4A080}
[Sara]
"I mean, it's to help Nakkyu, right? I can't 
very well say no."

[Kid]
Th-thanks!


48 :
I grabbed Sara's hand and shouted happily.

I was so happy I could have jumped for joy...
Actually, I did jump.

I was sure that things would go fine.


{Y4A081}
[Sara]
"H-hey, hey, wait... Kid, what are you so happy 
about?"

[Kid]
Huh?


49 :

{Y4A082}
[Sara]
"All I said was that I'd help Nakkyu. This 
doesn't really have anything to do with you, 
does it? There's nothing in this for you."


{Y4A083}
[Sara]
So what are you so pumped about?

[Kid]
"Well, of course I'm happy. Y¤u's a 
good friend of mine."

[Sara]
.........

Sara stared at me suspiciously.


50 :

{Y4A084}
[Sara]
Oh, I get it~

[Kid]
Wh-what?


51 :
...Sara patted me on the back.

[Kid]
?


{Y4A085}
[Sara]
Uh huh. So that's what's been going on.

Sara shot me a sly grin.

I had a bad feeling about the whole thing.

[Kid]
"Don't go imagining anything stupid. 
I'm just..."


52 :

{Y4A086}
[Sara]
Dear Jove! Love, 'tis a beautiful thing.


{Y4A087}
[Sara]
Fret not, dear Kid, I shan't tell a soul.

[Kid]
...

(What the heck is Sara talking about?)

[Kid]
Well, Y¤u is waiting, so we'd best get going.


53 :
I started heading for the security office while
pulling Sara's hand.


54 :
But it ended up being my arm that got yanked.

[Kid]
Whoa...!


55 :
I lost my balance and stumbled forward,
leaning on Sara.

Without missing a beat, she grabbed my left
thumb and squeezed it tight.

She drew close to me and whispered in my ear.


{Y4A088}
[Sara]
To tell you the truth, I'm a bit jealous.


{Y4A089}
[Sara]
I'm jealous, but...

[Kid]
...?


56 :

{Y4A090}
[Sara]
"But since it's you that she's gone for, 
I'll let it go."

As she spoke, she pushed me away and slapped
me on the back.

I was getting more and more confused.


57 :

{Y4A091}
[Sara]
Alright. Shall we get started?

Sara sat in the chair, popped her knuckles, and
faced the keyboard.


58 :

{Y4A092}
[Y¤u]
Mayo, I'm really sorry.


{Y4A093}
[Sara]
Don't worry about it. It's no big deal.


59 :

{Y4A094}
[Sara]
You're in good hands with me.

[Kid]
Hopefully you can help, Sara.


60 :

{Y4A095}
[Sara]
Trust me.


61 :
Sara started tapping away on the keyboard.

A number of windows opened up on the screen.


{Y4A096}
[Sara]
First, let's try stealing a password.


62 :
Her typing was fast and rhythmical.

Finally, a list of files came up.

She opened one of the files.

She opened a search window and started poring
through files.


63 :

{Y4A097}
[Sara]
Let's see...


{Y4A098}
[Sara]
Huh? It's not there...


{Y4A099}
[Sara]
"In this kind of OS, the file should be saved 
here, but..."

[Kid]
What are you looking for?


64 :

{Y4A100}
[Sara]
The password hash values.

[Kid]
What's that?


{Y4A101}
[Sara]
"It's an unchangeable string of letters or 
numbers created by a mathematical function 
when a user sets a password."

[Kid]
Wh-what?


{Y4A102}
[Sara]
"If you can find the hash, then it's easy to 
get a password."


{Y4A103}
[Sara]
"For example, if you save a large number of 
the hashes and compare them with the hash 
values in the password file, then..."

[Kid]
...Can't you make it easier to understand?


65 :

{Y4A104}
[Sara]
"Alright. It's basically like the password's 
fingerprint."


66 :

{Y4A105}
[Sara]
"While you can't create a person from a 
fingerprint, you can identify one, right?"


{Y4A901}
[Sara]
"It's the same as a fingerprint. The hash 
always reflects the characteristics of the 
original."

{Y4A902}
[Sara]
"And the modulation pattern is always 
derived from the character lineup of the 
original..."

[Kid]
"I... I still don't get it. I think it's just 
beyond me... Sorry to bug you."


67 :
I wiped away sweat and walked a short distance
from Sara.

Y¤u watched Sara as she leaned against a wall.

I headed over to her.


{Y4A107}
[Sara]
"I wonder... It might be that there's a file 
that only the root authority can access..."


{Y4A108}
[Sara]
"Even if I did find it, it could be randomly 
sequenced..."


{Y4A109}
[Sara]
That'd mean I'd need another message...

Sara mumbled to herself as she worked.


Occasionally, Sara would fiddle with her
ribbon or tap her fingers on the desk... so
it didn't seem that she was having much luck.

[Kid]
I wonder if this'll work.


68 :

{Y4A110}
[Y¤u]
Maybe.

[Kid]
"But no matter how good Sara is, this isn't 
like a contest."


{Y4A111}
[Y¤u]
"Look, the contest Mayo won wasn't just any 
contest."


{Y4A112}
[Y¤u]
"The code she decrypted was a 68-bit strong 
code."

[Kid]
"...I'm not really sure how incredible 
that is."


{Y4A113}
[Y¤u]
"The strength of a code depends on how long 
the key to it is when the password is 
encrypted."


{Y4A114}
[Y¤u]
The longer it is, the harder it is to decode.

[Kid]
.........


69 :

{Y4A115}
[Y¤u]
"You still don't quite get it? Well, how 
about a specific example..."


70 :

{Y4A116}
[Y¤u]
"So if a 1-bit password is encrypted, it can 
come out in one of two ways."


{Y4A117}
[Y¤u]
"For example, say that 'E' is the letter. 
That can either be encrypted as a zero or a 
one with a 1-bit key."


{Y4A118}
[Y¤u]
"So when this becomes a 2-bit key, the 
possibilities are double the code, or four."


{Y4A119}
[Y¤u]
"So, for the example of 'E,' it would 
be either 00, 01, 10, or 11."


{Y4A120}
[Y¤u]
So, with a 3-bit key...


71 :

{Y4A121}
[Y¤u]
What do you think happens?

[Kid]
"Uh... Let's see... Um, there are two ways 
for a 1-bit, and four ways for a 2-bit, so..."

72 :
{11:0-1e}
{11:1}Six ways?

{11:1}Eight ways?


73 :
[Kid]
Are there six ways?


74 :

{Y4A122}
[Y¤u]
Wrong answer. Afraid not...

[Kid]
...


75 :
[Kid]
Are there eight ways?


76 :

{Y4A123}
[Y¤u]
Bingo. You got it.


77 :

{Y4A124}
[Y¤u]
"So, a 3-bit key for the letter 'E' could be 
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, or 111. 
A total of eight combinations."


{Y4A125}
[Y¤u]
"Every time the code key increases by one 
bit, the number of code patterns increases 
exponentially."


{Y4A126}
[Y¤u]
"So, for a 4-bit key there would be 16 
combinations, and for a 5-bit key, 32..."


{Y4A127}
[Y¤u]
So let's say this had a 68-bit key?

[Kid]
...

A 6-bit would be 64... A 7-bit would be
128... an 8-bit would be 256...

(Uh... Uh... Let's see...)


{Y4A128}
[Y¤u]
The right answer is 2 to the 68th power.

Y¤u was doing the calculations on the security
office calculator.


{Y4A129}
[Y¤u]
"So the number of code patterns that would be 
possible is roughly 2.951479052 x 10 to 
the 20th power."


{Y4A130}
[Y¤u]
"Or 295 quintillion, 147 quadrillion, 905
trillion, 179 billion, 352 million, 825 thousand,
856 different ways."

[Kid]
......


{Y4A131}
[Y¤u]
"It's like looking for a hair on the whole of 
the planet Earth, including the oceans."


{Y4A132}
[Y¤u]
That's the code that Mayo decrypted.


{Y4A133}
[Y¤u]
"But you know what? What's so incredible 
about it isn't that Mayo was able to do it, 
but the method she used to do it."

[Kid]
The method?


{Y4A134}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. There are two ways of finding a 
password. One involves difficult mathematical 
calculations..."


{Y4A135}
[Y¤u]
"The other is a method that has to do with 
trying every key."


{Y4A136}
[Y¤u]
"It seems like she couldn't find an algorithm 
to work for the first method..."


{Y4A137}
[Y¤u]
"So a normal person would opt for the second 
option."


{Y4A138}
[Y¤u]
"And that's using all of the computers around 
the world participating in the contest. If you 
didn't, they say the calculations would take 
tens of thousands of years."


{Y4A139}
[Y¤u]
But... But Mayo did it differently.

[Kid]
She didn't...


{Y4A140}
[Y¤u]
Yup. She sure did.


{Y4A141}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo put together her own algorithm and did 
it using difficult mathematical calculations."


{Y4A142}
[Y¤u]
"And just seven days after the competition 
started, she had found the password."

[Kid]
............................


78 :
It was too incredible. It didn't seem real.

I should've been surprised, but I wasn't.

It was just too hard to imagine that the girl
in front of me could do that...

(Sara... What in the world... are you?)


79 :

{Y4A143}
[Sara]
Agghh! This isn't right!

Sara pounded her fist on the console.

[Kid]
It's not working?


80 :

{Y4A144}
[Sara]
"Obviously not! Stop asking me about every 
little thing!"

[Kid]
.........


81 :

{Y4A145}
[Sara]
Oh, I'm sorry... I'm just a little irritated.

[Kid]
"Don't worry about it. I'm sorry for asking 
you to do this."

[Sara]
.........


82 :

{Y4A146}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, why don't we take a break? I made some 
coffee."

Y¤u had made coffee for the three of us.


{Y4A147}
[Y¤u]
Here you go, Mayo.

Y¤u handed Sara her coffee.


83 :

{Y4A148}
[Sara]
Oh, thank you so much

Sara's coffee came with milk and the sugar
bowl.

[Kid]
H-hey.

[Kid]
"Didn't you say that you weren't supposed to 
put anything in coffee?"


84 :

{Y4A149}
[Y¤u]
It's okay. Mayo is a special exception.


{Y4A150}
[Sara]
Yup.


85 :

{Y4A151}
[Y¤u/Sara]
That's right~

[Kid]
Hey, that's not fair.


86 :

{Y4A152}
[Y¤u]
Oh, stop complaining!


{Y4A153}
[Sara]
Y¤u and I are different than you, that's all.


87 :
(Leave it to Y¤u to change the rules!)

Not wanting to start an argument, I silently
put milk and sugar in my coffee.

...

After a bit, Y¤u asked Sara...


88 :

{Y4A154}
[Y¤u]
So? How're you doing, Mayo?


89 :

{Y4A155}
[Sara]
So far, I've got nothing.

Sara turned her palms out, letting them face
the ceiling.

She meant she had zilch.


{Y4A156}
[Y¤u]
"Wow, if this is even tough for you, Mayo, this 
must be some security..."


90 :

{Y4A157}
[Sara]
"To tell you the truth, the security here is 
way above normal."


{Y4A158}
[Sara]
"I don't think that they're using just a 
normal firewall. They seem to have made some 
kind of improvements on the daemons, as well."

[Kid]
Fire well? Daem what...? Huh?


91 :

{Y4A159}
[Sara]
"A firewall is a way of protecting a network 
from unknown intruders."


{Y4A160}
[Sara]
"Daemons reside on the OS in the memory. 
They're responsible for all of the..."

[Kid]
Uh, okay... I get it... Thanks.

(That's it, I'm not asking any more
questions...)


{Y4A161}
[Y¤u]
It's that tough, huh?


92 :
Sara nodded.

'...Normally this kind of OS software is put
together using C...'

'...So, I tried to attack it using DoS...'

'...But it's been reinforced...'

'...I'm having trouble finding a hole in the
security...'

The conversation (mostly Sara talking) might
as well have been in some alien language.


93 :

{Y4A162}
[Y¤u]
"Well, when it gets that complicated, that's 
pretty much my limit..."


{Y4A163}
[Y¤u]
"I'm getting more and more suspicious about 
this database."


{Y4A164}
[Y¤u]
"I wonder what Leiblich is trying to hide with 
all this security?"


{Y4A165}
[Sara]
"Yeah... It's really strange. This isn't your 
average company's security system."

I suddenly remembered that on the first day,
Sora had told me the reason why Leiblich
built LeMU was a corporate secret.

I wondered if it could be related.


94 :

{Y4A166}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, can't you use the program that worked 
to win that decoding contest, Mayo?"

[Kid]
Oh, that's an idea.


{Y4A167}
[Y¤u]
"And if we could figure out the root authority 
password..."


{Y4A168}
[Sara]
That's impossible.


{Y4A169}
[Y¤u]
Why?


{Y4A170}
[Sara]
"I did a check on the code strength. Guess 
what it was."

[Kid]
What?


{Y4A171}
[Sara]
136-bit.

[Kid]
What?


95 :

{Y4A172}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what...? That means...

The number of possible patterns was 2 to the
136th power.


96 :

{Y4A174}
[Sara]
"Even if you had what it took to get the 
password, by the time you found it..."

Sara held out her fist and opened it up.

Booom!

She was right...

LeMU was going to go in three days.

[Y¤u]
...

Y¤u was depressed.

[Kid]
Isn't there anything else you can try?


97 :

{Y4A175}
[Sara]
Well, there is one thing...


{Y4A176}
[Sara]
There is one trick I haven't tried.


98 :

{Y4A177}
[Y¤u]
What's that?

A ray of hope returned to Y¤u's eyes.


99 :

{Y4A178}
[Sara]
"Everything I tried up until now has been cracking 
this using orthodox methods."

[Kid]
"Uh, there's no such thing as orthodox 
cracking, is there...?"

Sara ignored me and went on talking.


{Y4A179}
[Sara]
What's left...


{Y4A180}
[Sara]
"Is a kind of cracking that doesn't really 
require technology."


{Y4A181}
[Sara]
It's called 'social engineering'.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
What's that?


100 :

{Y4A182}
[Sara]
"Simply put, it's using social behavior to 
get information... For example..."

Sara stopped as if it was hard to say.


{Y4A183}
[Sara]
"For example, finding a person that works for 
the company operating the server you want to 
attack and tricking them into giving you 
a password."

[Kid]
You get it by tricking... someone...?


101 :

{Y4A184}
[Y¤u]
You're talking about tricking Sora?

Sara nodded.

[Kid]
There... There's no way we could do it.

[Kid]
Even if we could trick Sora...


{Y4A185}
[Sara]
"Of course, it's not something I want to do 
either."


{Y4A186}
[Sara]
"From Sora's perspective, she can't very well 
leak company information..."


{Y4A187}
[Sara]
And I won't try to force her. But...


{Y4A188}
[Sara]
But that's how you get information illegally.


{Y4A189}
[Sara]
"But if you're set on getting that 
information no matter what, you don't 
have much choice."


{Y4A190}
[Sara]
I just want you to know that.

I couldn't think of anything to say.

We were using a computer to do it, so it
didn't seem real, but we were actually trying
to deceive someone to get information.

That was exactly what we were trying to do.


{Y4A191}
[Y¤u]
"A system's biggest bug is the people 
who use it..."


102 :

{Y4A192}
[Y¤u]
My mom used to say that a lot.


{Y4A193}
[Y¤u]
"In that way, maybe we're all bugs 
in LeMMIH's system."

Y¤u stared straight at Sara.


{Y4A194}
[Y¤u]
I agree with you, Mayo.


{Y4A195}
[Y¤u]
But I just can't do it.


{Y4A196}
[Y¤u]
I can't do anything to deceive Sora.


{Y4A197}
[Y¤u]
"Even if I lose the chance to find out what 
happened to my dad."


{Y4A198}
[Y¤u]
"Mayo, I'm sorry for asking for such a 
difficult favor... but I think I'd rather try 
something else for now."


103 :
Sara looked down.


104 :
But then lifted her face, grinning broadly.


{Y4A199}
[Sara]
Okay then. We'll do it your way.


105 :
Sara faced the keyboard again.

[Kid]
Sara...


106 :

{Y4A200}
[Sara]
"Don't worry. No matter how stubborn the 
system is, it was made by people, and they 
can't be as stubborn as me!"


{Y4A201}
[Sara]
There's got to be a weak point somewhere...


107 :
Sara began typing away.


108 :
Just then, the room was bathed in a bright
light.

We covered our eyes.

After a bit, our eyes got used to it.

I squinted against the light.

And there was...


109 :
Sora!?

Sora was floating in the air and surrounded by a
bright ring of light.

She was looking down at us from above.

She was wearing a white-looking cape that
fanned out like a pair of wings...

She looked like an angel descending from
heaven...

[Kid]
"Wh-what is it, Sora...? Showing up all of a 
sudden..."

[Sora]
.........


110 :
[Kid]
Sora?

Something wasn't right.


{Y4A202}
[Sora]
"There was some abnormal traffic on LeMMIH, so 
I came to see what was going on..."


{Y4A203}
[Sora]
What are you all doing?

Sora spoke politely, but her eyes were
like ice.

We should have expected her to see through us.


But why did she seem completely different
than the Sora we were used to?


{Y4A204}
[Sora]
Please answer.


{Y4A205}
[Sara]
"Can't you tell by looking? We're trying to 
crack LeMMIH."

Sara answered coldly.


{Y4A206}
[Sora]
"Do you all know the meaning of what you are 
doing?"

[Kid]
"Sora! Please listen to what we have to say 
first."


111 :
[Kid]
"Y¤u's father was a member of the team that 
made LeMMIH."

[Kid]
In other words, he's your father too, Sora.

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
But he disappeared seventeen years ago...

[Kid]
"There was an accident here at the same time, 
the cause of which was unclear."

[Kid]
Something about the whole thing is shady.

[Kid]
"Both the accident and the disappearance of 
Y¤u's father... We think that there's 
probably something behind the scenes 
connecting them..."

[Kid]
"So Y¤u is trying to get the facts about 
her dad. She's looking for the truth."


{Y4A207}
[Y¤u]
Please, Sora...


{Y4A208}
[Y¤u]
"We aren't asking for your help. But please, 
just look the other way."

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
Sora...


{Y4A209}
[Sora]
So that's... what this is about...


{Y4A210}
[Sora]
Tanaka-san's father was...


{Y4A211}
[Y¤u]
Sora...?


{Y4A212}
[Sora]
"If it was something I could do, I would like 
to help you."


{Y4A213}
[Sora]
If it were possible...

Sora closed her eyes for a while...

...And then opened them.


{Y4A214}
[Sora]
I understand your intentions.


{Y4A215}
[Sora]
"But my duty is to protect LeMMIH from 
intruders."


{Y4A216}
[Sora]
So I am supposed to stop you.


{Y4A217}
[Sora]
That is how I am designed.


{Y4A218}
[Sora]
"I alone have no choice... but to obey 
my orders."

[Kid]
But that's not...


{Y4A219}
[Sora]
Oh... but... what should I...

Sora's shoulders shook, and she had a pained
look on her face.


{Y4A220}
[Sara]
Sora, it's fine.

[Kid]
Huh?


112 :

{Y4A221}
[Sara]
It's alright. I think it'll work out somehow.

[Kid]
"Work out somehow...? Sara, what are you trying to 
do?"


{Y4A222}
[Sara]
"If Sora follows her current program, 
then she'll have to get in our way."


{Y4A223}
[Sara]
But Sora doesn't want that.


{Y4A224}
[Sara]
"So I should just rewrite the program so 
that Sora can take the action that she 
wants to take."


{Y4A225}
[Sora]
Can you do that?


113 :

{Y4A226}
[Sara]
Maybe.


{Y4A227}
[Sara]
Of course, that's if you want me to...

[Sora]
.........

Sora's shoulders quivered slightly.

[Kid]
Sora, are you scared?


114 :

{Y4A228}
[Sora]
Yes, a little.


{Y4A229}
[Sora]
No... I am very scared.

[Sara]
.........


115 :

{Y4A230}
[Y¤u]
Let's... not do this.


{Y4A231}
[Y¤u]
"I don't want my selfishness to cause any more 
problems for everyone."


116 :

{Y4A232}
[Sara]
Be quiet, Y¤u.


{Y4A233}
[Sara]
"This has something to do with everyone, 
not just you."

[Y¤u]
.........


117 :

{Y4A234}
[Sara]
Okay, Sora. It's up to you.

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
Hey, Sora?

[Kid]
"I'd like you to listen to me and then decide 
after you hear what I've got to say..."

[Kid]
Sora, you said it yourself.


118 :

{S2C091}
[Sora]
"I am different from everyone else, 
but I want to be the same."


119 :
[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
"You wanted to exist in the same way that 
we do."

[Kid]
And we want the same thing.

[Kid]
That is all I wanted to say.

[Sora]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

Finally, Sora lifted her face and focused
her eyes on Sara.


120 :

{Y4A235}
[Sora]
Alright. I agree. Matsunaga-san, please do your best.


121 :

{Y4A236}
[Sara]
As you wish.


{Y4A237}
[Y¤u]
Mayo, you be careful.


{Y4A238}
[Y¤u]
Please, don't hurt Sora...


122 :

{Y4A239}
[Sara]
It'll be fine. Trust me.


123 :
Sara typed on the keyboard.


{Y4A240}
[Sara]
"Alright then. Sorry, Sora, but I'm going 
to take a look inside you now."


{Y4A241}
[Sara]
Don't worry. Think of it like an x-ray.

Sara continued working as we watched.

As we watched her deft hands, Sora's tense
expression began to relax.

It was then that...


124 :

{Y4A242}
[Sora]
Ugghhh...!

Sora began to suffer.

[Kid]
Wh-what's the matter?


125 :

{Y4A243}
[Sora]
Ohhhh... Please stop...!


126 :

{Y4A244}
[Sora]
Stop, stop... Stooop!


127 :
[Kid]
S-Sora...?


{Y4A245}
[Sora]
System scanning error.


{Y4A246}
[Sora]
"Unauthorized access to the autonomic nervous 
system confirmed."

[Kid]
Wh-what happened?


{Y4A247}
[Y¤u]
How am I supposed to know?


{Y4A248}
[Sara]
"Dang. That sucks... It looks like I got 
snagged by the scan..."

[Kid]
What's that mean?


{Y4A249}
[Sara]
"That the surveillance program that's 
managing Sora discovered it was being cracked."


128 :

{Y4A250}
[Sora]
Oh no...!


{Y4A251}
[Sora]
Everyone... Please escape at once!


{Y4A252}
[Sora]
If you stay... I...


{Y4A253}
[Sora]
I may... harm you.


{Y4A254}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


{Y4A255}
[Sora]
Escape...


{Y4A256}
[Sora]
H-hurry!


129 :

{Y4A257}
[Sora]
Intruder route discovered.


{Y4A258}
[Sora]
Oh... I'm not going to make it!

Sora held out her hand.


{Y4A259}
[Sora]
"I will now carry out elimination of the 
intruder."


130 :
Our surroundings suddenly changed.

We were no longer in the security office.

We were in the middle of a roiling ocean.

The water swirled loudly.

(Wh-what is this!?)

It appeared as if we were about to be sucked
in and have our bodies torn to pieces.

I tried to shout... but water continued to rush
into my lungs, and I couldn't breathe.

(What is... happening?)


{Y4A260}
[Y¤u]
Is this... an RSD image?

Y¤u shouted that.


{Y4A261}
[Y¤u]
Everyone, close your eyes!


131 :
When I closed my eyes, the surrounding
apocalyptic scenery seemed like a lie.

The ocean current continued to amplify in my ears.

It was all the work of a generated hologram.

So it was no longer scary.


{Y4A262}
[Sora]
It is no use.


{Y4A263}
[Sora]
Aaahh! Please, stop!

The next instant, a high-frequency scream rang
out in my mind.

My head hurt so much that I thought it might split
open.

[Kid]
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

Unable to withstand it, I took out the voice
converters that I thought were causing the
pain.

But the sound went on.


132 :

{Y4A264}
[Sora]
That is why I said it was no use.


{Y4A265}
[Sora]
"Sound is also being emitted from the room's 
speakers."


{Y4A266}
[Sora]
As long as you are in LeMU, you cannot escape.

[Kid]
Pl-please stop...!


{Y4A267}
[Y¤u]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

The pain was so intense that we were rolling
around on the floor.


133 :

{Y4A268}
[Sora]
Ahh... Aaahhhh! I... I...!


134 :

{Y4A269}
[Sora]
"I am warning you. Remove yourself 
from LeMMIH."


{Y4A270}
[Sora]
Cease what you are doing immediately.


{Y4A271}
[Sara]
N-no...!


135 :

{Y4A272}
[Sora]
"Please, Matsunaga-san. That is enough.
Please stop!"


{Y4A273}
[Sara]
I said no!


{Y4A274}
[Sara]
"I have to do this... for Sora...
for Nakkyu... and for myself."


{Y4A275}
[Sara]
I won't lose to Leiblich!


136 :
Sara continued pecking at the keyboard.


137 :

{Y4A276}
[Sora]
"This is your final warning. Desist 
immediately."


{Y4A277}
[Sora]
"If you persist in your efforts, I cannot 
guarantee your safety."


{Y4A278}
[Sara]
"There has to be a hole somewhere in the 
security...!"


138 :

{Y4A279}
[Sora]
M-Matsunaga-san...!


{Y4A280}
[Sara]
"Wh... what? I'm not giving up... no matter 
what...!"


{Y4A281}
[Sora]
"There is no... I will from now... release 
one segment of my security."


{Y4A282}
[Sora]
"Please aim for it... by sending in a massive 
load of data."


{Y4A283}
[Sara]
You mean... Cause an overload...?


{Y4A284}
[Sora]
"Yes... That should... make my system go out of 
control."


{Y4A285}
[Sora]
"I can't guarantee... the outcome... but it 
might create a gap long enough for you to 
rewrite the system."


{Y4A286}
[Sara]
Okay... Please do it!


{Y4A287}
[Sora]
"With my power... I can only free it up for 
a short amount of time."


{Y4A288}
[Sora]
Don't miss the chance.


{Y4A289}
[Sora]
The chance will be... one seventeenth of a second.


{Y4A290}
[Sara]
Got it.


{Y4A291}
[Sora]
Okay. Here I go...


{Y4A292}
[Sora]
Gggrrrrhhh...!


139 :
Beeeeeeeep!


{Y4A293}
[Sora]
A type 14 error has occurred.


{Y4A294}
[Sora]
Now!


{Y4A295}
[Sara]
Sorry, Sora!


{Y4A296}
[Sora]
One segment of security...


140 :
Sara pushed the enter key.


{Y4A297}
[Sora]
...Has discovered an impediment...


{Y4A298}
[Sora]
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!


141 :
Beeeeeeeep!


{Y4A299}
[Sora]
A type 7 error has occurred.


{Y4A300}
[Sora]
Approaching numerical limit.


{Y4A301}
[Sara]
I did it!

The high-frequency attack stopped.


{Y4A302}
[Sora]
Aaaah... Arrrghhh... Oooooowww!

Sora struggled in pain.

Finally, her body began trembling.

[Kid]
Sora!?


{Y4A303}
[Y¤u]
Sora... looks bad...


142 :
Beeeeeeeep!


{Y4A304}
[Sora]
A type 9 error has occurred.


{Y4A305}
[Sora]
"Division by zero will be initiated according 
to application formatting."


{Y4A306}
[Sara]
Here goes the overload...


143 :
Beeeeeeeep!


{Y4A307}
[Sora]
Waaaaa! Wh-what's happening to me...?


{Y4A308}
[Sora]
"I am... I am Akanegasaki Sora... A system
engineer in LeMU's research and development
division... and assistant in charge of 
operating LeMU."


144 :
Crackle!

A part of the console sparked.


{Y4A309}
[Sora]
"I... will be your guide today during your visit 
to LeMU."


{Y4A310}
[Sora]
"I... guarantee your safety and the safety of 
everyone in LeMU."


{Y4A311}
[Sora]
I am the protector of everyone in LeMU.


{Y4A312}
[Sora]
I am the defender of all in LeMU.


145 :
Crackle!


{Y4A313}
[Sora]
I am... I am...


{Y4A314}
[Sora]
Who am I?


{Y4A315}
[Sara]
"Don't lose yourself! You are Sora! You are
Akanegasaki Sora and have been spending time
with us!"


{Y4A316}
[Sora]
I have... with everyone...?


146 :
Beeeeeeeep!


147 :

{Y4A317}
[Sora]
A type 34 error has occurred.


{Y4A318}
[Sora]
"Unanticipated orders are attempting to be 
implemented."


148 :

{Y4A319}
[Sora]
Uuughhhhhhh!

Sora started suffering even more...


149 :
And then something surprising happened.

Sora... split in two.

[Kid]
Sora... is two...


{Y4A320}
[Y¤u]
You mean... she divided...?

It wasn't an illusion.

Of course, given that it was all
RSD-generated, there was no guarantee
that it all wasn't an illusion...

At least I wasn't the only one that saw it.


Y¤u and Sara seemed to be seeing it too.

The new Sora attacked, grabbing the old
Sora by the throat.

The two of them struggled equally.

The two Soras...

It was like an apple split into two pieces...?

No! It was like an apple reproduced in whole.

Non-reductional division...

I figured that it was the result of
overloading LeMMIH.


{Y4A321}
[Sara]
Okay! I got the root authority!


{Y4A322}
[Sora]
"Do it now! If you strike now, you can 
rewrite the system!"


{Y4A323}
[Sora]
A fatal... system error... has occurred...


{Y4A324}
[Sora]
"Data may be... damaged... Immediately... 
initiate... rebuilding..."


{Y4A325}
[Sora]
"In 30 seconds... the emergency reset...
will initiate."


{Y4A326}
[Sora]
"Hurry! LeMMIH is resetting the system 
to rebuild it!"


{Y4A327}
[Sora]
You must act before that! Hurry!


{Y4A328}
[Sara]
Okay! Just be patient, Sora.


150 :
Sara typed the keys at a furious speed.

All we could do was stand helplessly and watch.


{Y4A329}
[Sora]
Seventeen seconds to reset.


{Y4A330}
[Sora]
Matsunaga-san? Not yet?


{Y4A331}
[Sara]
Just a little more!

Sara continued pounding in code as she
wiped the sweat from her brow.


{Y4A332}
[Sora]
Seven seconds to reset.


{Y4A333}
[Sora]
Matsunaga-san!


{Y4A334}
[Sara]
I've got it!

Sara stood as if she were ejected from
her chair.


{Y4A335}
[Sora]
Three seconds to reset.


{Y4A336}
[Sara]
Okay! Ninja Technology Technique...


{Y4A337}
[Sara]
Time to turn the tables!


151 :
Sara struck the keyboard with her palm.


152 :
The room was flooded with bright light.

The two of Sora's images began to overlap...


The two fused into one.

At the same time, the system underwent an
emergency reset.


153 :
At that instant, we were all swallowed
into pitch blackness.

Darkness and silence... colors and sound lost.

LeMMIH temporarily ceased functioning.


154 :
And then, exactly 170 seconds later...

LeMMIH rebooted.


155 :
The lights and other machinery restarted.

The fan of the computer gave off a quiet
whirring sound. The display on the wall
came online all at once.

There was a surge of letters rushing across
the monitor... The system start up
screen... It finally switched to
automatic operating mode.

And then Sora appeared again before us.

She seemed to suddenly appear floating in
the air, but she still had a solid presence.


She closed her eyes, and it looked as if
she was embracing herself as she descended.

[Kid]
Sora...?

Sora slowly opened her eyes.


156 :

{Y4A338}
[Sora]
Good morning.


157 :

{Y4A339}
[Sora]
...Everyone.

Saying that, she smiled broadly.

[Kid]
Do you know who we are? Do you remember us?

I pointed at myself.


158 :

{Y4A340}
[Sora]
Yes, Kid-san.


{Y4A341}
[Sora]
And Tanaka-san and Matsunaga-san as well.


{Y4A342}
[Sora]
"And Kuranari-san and Komachi-san, although they 
of course are not present."


159 :

{Y4A343}
[Y¤u]
Oh... I'm so glad you remember...


160 :

{Y4A344}
[Sora]
Yes.


{Y4A345}
[Sara]
"Hey, Sora. I'd like to investigate LeMMIH's 
C level data. Could you help me?"


161 :

{Y4A346}
[Sora]
Of course. I'll do my best.

Sora nodded slightly as she spoke.

[Kid]
Hey, there's something I'd like to know...

[Kid]
"Sara, what in the world did you do to 
rewrite the system?"


162 :

{Y4A347}
[Sara]
Uh, well... Actually, I didn't change anything.


{Y4A348}
[Sara]
"I just added a patch that changes the 
priority duties."


{Y4A349}
[Sora]
"That is correct. My processing routine 
has not been altered."


{Y4A350}
[Sora]
"However, now my duty to serve you is higher 
priority than that of my duty to protect 
LeMMIH."

[Kid]
Hmmm. I don't really understand, but...

[Kid]
"But you mean that you no longer have to 
stop us?"


{Y4A351}
[Sora]
That is correct.


{Y4A352}
[Sora]
"And if it will be of use to you, then 
I will show you the internal workings of 
LeMMIH."


163 :

{Y4A353}
[Sara]
"Now then, shall we jump right into the 
search?"


164 :

{Y4A354}
[Sora]
By all means.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Hey? Y¤u, what's wrong?

Y¤u was hunched over and quiet. She didn't
look well.


165 :

{Y4A355}
[Y¤u]
Thank you... Sora... and Mayo.


{Y4A356}
[Y¤u]
You've done so much for me...

And then Sara said...


{Y4A357}
[Sara]
That doesn't seem like you... Nakkyu.


{Y4A358}
[Sara]
"You can't choose what you have to do to get 
what you want, so please just keep being yourself!"

Sara waved her words away casually with the
palm of her hand.

I agreed with her completely.

[Kid]
She's right. Don't lose sight of yourself.


{Y4A359}
[Sora]
I agree.


166 :

{Y4A360}
[Y¤u]
Okay...


167 :

{Y4A361}
[Y¤u]
And thank you too, Kid.

[Kid]
Huh? Me? I didn't do anything.


{Y4A362}
[Y¤u]
"What are you talking about? You're the one 
that persuaded Sara to help, right?"


{Y4A363}
[Sora]
"And my decision was based on your words of 
wisdom."

'We want the same thing.`



{Y4A364}
[Sora]
"It was your advice that helped me to make 
up my mind."

[Kid]
I see... So that's what happened.

I felt a bit embarrassed.


168 :

{Y4A365}
[Y¤u]
Alright! Now, enough warm fuzzies...


{Y4A366}
[Y¤u]
Let's start investigating!


169 :

{Y4A367}
[Everyone]
Alright!


170 :
And so we restarted the investigation into
Y¤u's father.

The only clue that we had to start off our
investigation was the name of Y¤u's father,
'Tanaka Yoichi'.

Actually, the work going on beneath the
surface of LeMMIH's exterior was all
done by Sora.

It looked like the system still couldn't
be accessed by normal means. Sara was worn out,
but she kept on typing.


171 :
...Nearly half an hour had passed since Sora
had disappeared inside LeMMIH.


172 :
Sora suddenly appeared from inside the console.

[Kid]
Are you finished?


173 :

{Y4A368}
[Sora]
"I can only tell you what I was able to learn, 
but..."


{Y4A369}
[Sara]
Good work.


{Y4A370}
[Y¤u]
So? What did you find out?

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
It didn't work?


{Y4A371}
[Sora]
No, I have uncovered various facts.


{Y4A372}
[Y¤u]
In that case, hurry up and tell us.

[Sora]
.........


174 :

{Y4A373}
[Sara]
...Sora?

Sora stared straight at Y¤u.

Her serious expression made Y¤u wrinkle her
brow.

It didn't look like the kind of situation
suitable for light talk or jokes.

I wondered what Sora could have found...?


{Y4A374}
[Sora]
Tanaka-san, I want you to stay calm and listen.


{Y4A375}
[Sora]
There is a possibility...


{Y4A376}
[Sora]
"That your father, Tanaka Yoichi, has already 
died."


175 :

{Y4A377}
[Y¤u]
...Huh...? My father... dead?


{Y4A378}
[Sora]
Yes, 34 years ago.

[Kid]
34 years ago...?

[Sara]
...


176 :

{Y4A379}
[Y¤u]
H-hold... on...


{Y4A380}
[Y¤u]
What do you mean 34 years ago?


{Y4A381}
[Y¤u]
I'm only 18 years old.


{Y4A382}
[Y¤u]
I was born 18 years ago.


{Y4A383}
[Y¤u]
"How could anything as ridiculous as my father 
dying 34 years ago be true?"

[Kid]
"Y-yeah... Sora, what you're saying just doesn't 
match the facts."


{Y4A384}
[Sora]
Please just stay calm and listen.


{Y4A385}
[Sora]
I have not reached a final conclusion.


{Y4A386}
[Sora]
"I am merely saying that there is the 
possibility."


177 :
[Y¤u]
.........


{Y4A387}
[Sora]
"First, I tried to search for information on 
Tanaka-san's father."


{Y4A388}
[Sora]
"However, there were no files pertaining to 'Tanaka
Yoichi' recorded in LeMU's database."


{Y4A389}
[Sora]
"In other words, there are no records that 
anyone by that name existed."

[Kid]
"So are you saying... that Y¤u's father wasn't 
here?"


{Y4A390}
[Y¤u]
It... It can't be...


{Y4A391}
[Sara]
"But that's only based on limited information 
from the areas of files you can access, right, 
Sora? You said there were areas you couldn't 
breach, right?"


178 :

{Y4A392}
[Sora]
Of course, that is correct.


{Y4A393}
[Sora]
I am merely an interface program for LeMMIH.


{Y4A394}
[Sora]
"I am not permitted to access high-security 
data."


{Y4A395}
[Sara]
"So records about Tanaka Yoichi might be 
there."

Sora continued, responding to Sara's question.


{Y4A396}
[Sora]
That is a possibility that I can't deny.


{Y4A397}
[Sora]
"However, there is no such name on company 
name lists, accounting records, or any of the 
message logs exchanged on the local area 
network..."


{Y4A398}
[Sora]
"As far as these are concerned, no record of 
'Tanaka Yoichi' exists."


179 :

{Y4A399}
[Y¤u]
That can't be!


180 :

{Y4A400}
[Y¤u]
I'm sure that my father worked here at LeMU!


{Y4A401}
[Y¤u]
And besides... Besides...


{Y4A402}
[Y¤u]
"Even if he wasn't here... that doesn't mean 
that he's dead, right?"


{Y4A403}
[Sora]
Correct...


181 :
‡LBang!


{Y4A404}
[Y¤u]
"No, it's not 'correct'! Tell me how you 
reached that theory!"


{Y4A405}
[Sara]
Nakkyu, please calm down.

Sara grabbed Y¤u as she went to grab Sora.

Y¤u was on the verge of losing reason and
getting carried away by her emotions.


{Y4A406}
[Sora]
I will explain my research and reasoning.


{Y4A407}
[Sora]
But first... may I ask you a question?


{Y4A408}
[Y¤u]
?


{Y4A409}
[Sora]
"This may sound rude, but... where did you hear 
that your father was an employee at LeMU?"


182 :

{Y4A410}
[Y¤u]
I...


{Y4A411}
[Sora]
"That your father disappeared when you were one 
year old."


{Y4A412}
[Sora]
"If that is a fact, then you should have no 
memories of your father..."


{Y4A413}
[Sora]
Am I wrong?


{Y4A414}
[Y¤u]
No, you're right.


{Y4A415}
[Y¤u]
I don't remember anything about my father.


{Y4A416}
[Y¤u]
"I don't remember us playing together or him 
holding me..."


183 :

{Y4A417}
[Y¤u]
"But I'm sure that he was around until 
I was one."


{Y4A418}
[Y¤u]
"There are pictures and films of that time. 
I'm sure he was there."


{Y4A419}
[Y¤u]
I'm sure that my mom said so as well.


{Y4A420}
[Sora]
So that was the case...


184 :

{Y4A421}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


{Y4A422}
[Sora]
It is about your mother...

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Sora]
.........


185 :

{Y4A423}
[Y¤u]
What is it? Why won't you say anything?


{Y4A424}
[Sora]
It's because...


{Y4A425}
[Y¤u]
What?


{Y4A426}
[Sora]
It is difficult to say...


{Y4A427}
[Y¤u]
"It might be difficult... but you've 
already told me many difficult things."

[Sora]
.........


{Y4A428}
[Y¤u]
So tell me. What happened with my mother?


{Y4A429}
[Sora]
You're sure?


186 :

{Y4A430}
[Y¤u]
Y-yes.


{Y4A431}
[Sora]
Then I will tell you.


{Y4A432}
[Sora]
Your mother... Tanaka Yukie...


{Y4A433}
[Sora]
Passed away fifteen years ago.


187 :

{Y4A434}
[Y¤u]
No!?


{Y4A435}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what are you saying? Sora...


{Y4A436}
[Y¤u]
How can you tell me that...


{Y4A437}
[Y¤u]
That's just not possible...


{Y4A438}
[Sora]
That is all that I can tell you.


{Y4A439}
[Sora]
"I will display the detailed documents on the 
screen."


{Y4A440}
[Sora]
Please refer to them.


188 :
Y¤u stumbled toward the display, sitting
down in front of it.

Sara and I read the display from over her
shoulder.

On the screen...

Was a record from the company LAN.

It was a notice of death.

There was a file about the office procedures
related to Tanaka Yukie's death.

There was a message log of messages exchanged
among employees about the notice of her death.

And a funeral notice.

...The screen kept changing from one
image to the next.

The next thing that was uploaded to
the server read...

02/07/19...

(So this was on July 19th, 2002, 15 years ago...)


At the end of the files, what appeared was...


A record of an online conversation
between employee 'Man A' in the Personnel
Section of the General Affairs Division
and 'Woman B' in the Second Section of the
Research Division.


189 :
A > But it really was a shock.

B > What was?

A > I mean about Yukie-san. Tanaka Yukie-san.

B > Ah, yeah...

B > Yükie-san was always so nice to me.


A > That's right. She was your boss, right?

A > Do you know the cause of death?

B > TB


190 :
A > TB?

B > Tief Blau

A > That again...

A > It's the same as how her husband died...

B > Her husband?

A > What? Oh, you mean you didn't know?

B > Is that so?

A > But we really shouldn't talk about this
at the company.


191 :
B > Why?

A > I'll tell you about later.

B > But Yöichi-san died 19 years ago, right?

A > That's why we can't talk about it!
I'm serious!

B > And she had a child... The poor thing...

A > She had a daughter, right?

A > I feel so sorry for her...


192 :
I checked to see when the log had been saved.

The date read 02/07/19.


193 :

{Y4A441}
[Y¤u]
That... can't be...


{Y4A442}
[Y¤u]
I won't believe it! I won't!


{Y4A443}
[Y¤u]
I absolutely can't believe it!


194 :
As she shouted that, Y¤u fled from the
security office.


195 :

{Y4A444}
[Sara]
Nakkyu!


196 :
Sara followed after her.


197 :
Sora and I remained behind.


198 :

{Y4A445}
[Sora]
Did you understand?


{Y4A446}
[Sora]
"As I said before, when I searched the 
database for the name 'Tanaka Yoichi', the data 
which I can access had no records."


{Y4A447}
[Sora]
"However, the chat log that appears to be 
fifteen years old..."


{Y4A448}
[Sora]
"It seems to indicate that Tanaka Yukie-sama had a 
husband named Yoichi-san."


{Y4A449}
[Sora]
"Judging from the context of the document... I 
conjectured that if Yoichi-san had died 19 years 
before, that would mean 34 years before now."

[Kid]
"But the name 'Tanaka Yoichi' doesn't appear in 
any of the other data. Why is it only here?"


{Y4A450}
[Sora]
"I can only speculate from my limited 
knowledge..."


{Y4A451}
[Sora]
"All records related to Tanaka Yoichi-san were 
erased for a reason."


{Y4A452}
[Sora]
"Please read the fourteenth and fifteenth line of 
this log one more time."

‡LA > What? Oh, you mean you didn't know?

‡LB > Is that so?

[Kid]
The flow of the conversation seems unnatural.


{Y4A453}
[Sora]
Yes.


{Y4A454}
[Sora]
"Originally, there seems to have been some text 
between these lines."

[Kid]
So you mean that someone erased part of it?


{Y4A455}
[Sora]
From A's comments, it would appear so.

[Kid]
"But Yoichi-san's name was left in B's 
comments..."

[Kid]
...Oh, I see.

199 :
{11:0-20}
{11:1}It was because it was in English

{11:1}It was because it had an umlaut


200 :
[Kid]
"What probably happened is that when the 
computer was searching, it automatically 
looked for..."

[Kid]
'Yoichi' in Japanese, erasing everything it found.

[Kid]
"However, B's comments were overlooked for
some reason."

[Kid]
That's because Yoichi's name is spelled in English.


{Y4A456}
[Sora]
No. Unfortunately, that is not correct.

[Kid]
What?


{Y4A457}
[Sora]
"The person that did the search would not 
be so foolish."


{Y4A458}
[Sora]
"It would appear that the name 'Yoichi' in 
English was also searched for and erased."

[Kid]
But what about this one?


{Y4A459}
[Sora]
Kid-san, look very closely at B's comments.


{Y4A460}
[Sora]
"Didn't she use a way of rendering the name 
that is uncommon?"

‡LB > But Yöichi-san died 19 years ago, right?


[Kid]
Oh! The... 'o' is an 'ö'...?


{Y4A461}
[Sora]
"Yes. This is called an 'umlaut' and is used 
mainly in German..."


{Y4A462}
[Sora]
"When an 'a', 'u', or 'o' vowel is followed by 
the letters 'i' or 'e', an umlaut is used to 
indicate that the sound is closer to the 
second."

[Kid]
"So you're saying... that because this 
included an umlaut..."


201 :
[Kid]
"What probably happened is that when the 
computer was searching, it automatically 
looked for..."

[Kid]
"'Yoichi' in Japanese and in English, 
erasing everything it found."


{Y4A463}
[Sora]
"However, B's comments were overlooked for 
some reason."

[Kid]
"And her comments had his name spelled as 
'Yöichi'!"


202 :

{Y4A464}
[Sora]
Correct.


{Y4A465}
[Sora]
"So I tried to look for other similar comments 
by B."


{Y4A466}
[Sora]
"It appears that she had a habit of using
abbreviated words..."


{Y4A467}
[Sora]
"...And spelling words in her own way in her 
communications with friends."

[Kid]
It seems to be a style particular to her.


{Y4A468}
[Sora]
"There are numerous examples of her writing 
things such as 'CU later' or 'B4' for before."

As she spoke, Sora pulled up samples of
correspondences.


203 :

{Y4A469}
[Sora]
But... do you think that Tanaka-san is alright?

[Kid]
"Well, Sara went after her, but I'm still 
kinda worried about her."


{Y4A470}
[Sora]
"I wonder if I shouldn't have told her 
after all..."

[Kid]
"No! You did the right thing! No matter what the 
facts are, that's what Y¤u wanted to know, and 
you told her."

[Kid]
"Y¤u knows that. She's tough. She can 
take it."


204 :

{Y4A471}
[Sora]
You know her well.

[Kid]
No... Not really...

My face started to flush. I started to fidget
uncomfortably.


205 :

{Y4A472}
[Sora]
"Don't you think you should go see how she is 
doing?"

[Kid]
Yeah. I will.


{Y4A473}
[Sora]
"And I will get back to the work that I was 
in the middle of."

[Kid]
Oh, Sora! Wait! There's one more thing.


206 :

{Y4A474}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it?

[Kid]
I just wanted to say... thanks for everything.


207 :
Sora's cheeks seemed to redden just a bit
and she smiled shyly.


{Y4A475}
[Sora]
I only did what is expected of me. And...


208 :
