1 :
After that...

We tried two emergency sets of stairs in
the area, but both were a waste of effort.

They were shut off by thick partitions, making
it impossible to climb up to Zweiter Stock.

According to Y¤u, there were a total of twelve
emergency staircases in LeMU.

Three of those were closed off, so that
left nine.

Y¤u and I walked around emergency corridors
searching for those nine.

But...


2 :
We met with a dead end...


3 :
And a dead end......


4 :
And a dead end.........

The watertight doors were completely shut and
there was no way we were getting them open
manually.

We gave up and headed out into the normal
corridors to see if we could work our way
around using them.

And still...


5 :
We met with a dead end...


6 :
And a dead end......


7 :
And a dead end.........

Inside the sprawling LeMU complex was
a web of several dozen corridors.

We investigated each, only finding closed doors
everywhere. It seemed hopeless.

Both the normal corridors and the emergency
corridors were sealed.

All of them were blocked off.

The only thing left for us to try was...


8 :

{S1A184}
[Y¤u]
Dritter Stock.


9 :

{S1A185}
[Y¤u]
"It looks like the only thing left is to go 
down a floor..."


10 :
With the elevators out of action, the emergency
stairs were our only choice.

Thankfully, one-third of the remaining three
stairways were still operating.

Which meant that even if there was no going
up, we could still go down.

Y¤u and I wound around and around the spiral
stairwell until we reached Dritter Stock (three
floors underwater).


11 :
[Kid]
Wa-water...

I muttered that without thinking when we
reached the floor.

As far as I could see, the floor was a sheet of
water that had flooded in...

It was about up to my ankles.

[Kid]
"There's water flooding in from 
somewhere else!"


12 :

{S1A186}
[Y¤u]
No, I don't think so.


{S1A187}
[Y¤u]
The water's not moving, is it?

When she mentioned it, I realized that there
wasn't even a ripple on the water's surface.

There was no evidence that the water level was
increasing.

I looked around to be sure, but there
weren't any signs that water was leaking
from anywhere.

[Kid]
Well then, what is this...?


13 :

{S1A188}
[Y¤u]
"This must be from the water that washed us 
away earlier."


{S1A189}
[Y¤u]
"I figure the seawater that pooled on Zweiter 
Stock flowed down here."


{S1A190}
[Y¤u]
"Maybe via the emergency stairs, or a vent...
I don't know how, but somehow it flowed down 
here."


14 :

{S1A191}
[Y¤u]
Hey, you remember that saying?


{S1A192}
[Y¤u]
About how water flows downhill...?


15 :
We entered the room from a door along the
corridor.

The room's massive, ancient remains were
steeped in water, making it seem just like
the seafloor had risen up.

As Y¤u and I looked around the wide room, our
legs splashed water all over.

Our drenched clothes were drying, so we
didn't really feel the cold.

The water on the floor was not as cold as I'd
expected.

But walking in water with shoes was,
well, unpleasant.


16 :
Finally...


17 :
When we turned into a corridor, we heard an
unexpected sound.


18 :
Bam, bam, bam, bam...

19 :
Bam, bam, bam, bam...


20 :

{S1A193}
[Y¤u]
Hey, did you hear something just now?

We stopped and listened.


21 :
Bam, bam, bam, bam...

22 :
Bam, bam, bam, bam...


23 :
Somebody was hitting something.

Somewhere nearby...

[Kid]
There are other people here...


24 :

{S1A194}
[Y¤u]
Other people that were left behind!


25 :
We ran at full speed in the direction of
the sound.


26 :

{S1A195}
[???]
Heeeeey! Somebooooody!


{S1A196}
[???]
Somebooooody!


{S1A197}
[???]
Is there anyone theeere?


{S1A198}
[???]
Anyooooone?

Two female voices were coming from inside the
elevator.


27 :
Y¤u and I looked at each other and nodded.


28 :

{S1A199}
[Y¤u]
Hold on just a little longer!


{S1A200}
[Y¤u]
We're going to open the door for you!


{S1A201}
[???]
Alright! Oh, good~


{S1A202}
[???]
I was so worried that no one would come~


29 :
The voice from inside sounded well.

It didn't sound weak or injured.


30 :

{S1A203}
[Y¤u]
Hang on, how are we going to open this?


31 :
Y¤u placed both of her hands on the door and
pushed left and right.


{S1A204}
[Y¤u]
Uggggh!


{S1A205}
[Y¤u]
"Oh! Why do we keep running into problems like
this!?"

[Kid]
Won't it open?


32 :

{S1A206}
[Y¤u]
"If you were paying attention, you'd be able to
tell! You give it a try!"


33 :
I switched places with Y¤u and reached out
to try to open the door.

[Kid]
Ummmpphhhhhhh!

It didn't budge.


{S1A207}
[Y¤u]
Come on! Put some power into it!

I tried to put my fingers in the crack in the
door, but my fingernails just barely squeezed
in, and nothing happened.

[Kid]
Owwww....

Blood started oozing from the nail of my index
finger.

But it was the digit next to it that caught
my eye.

The thumb on my left hand.

[Kid]
Hey...

I noticed a distinct mark on it.

On the meaty part of the thumb was a deep scar
about a centimeter long.

I wondered if I'd had it for long.

The mouth of the cut was swollen and
milky white-colored.


{S1A208}
[Y¤u]
Are you alright?

Her question brought me back to reality.


34 :

{S1A209}
[Y¤u]
Oh, you're bleeding. Let me see.

Y¤u grabbed my left hand.

I suddenly bent my thumb under it, hiding
the scar.

For some reason, I didn't want her to see it.

Y¤u took an adhesive bandage from her pocket
and put it on the bloody finger.


35 :

{S1A210}
[Y¤u]
I swear, you need so much looking after.

[Kid]
Th-thanks...

My finger smelled faintly sweet.


{S1A211}
[???]
Uh, the door still won't open?


36 :

{S1A212}
[Y¤u]
"But it seems there's someone that needs even
more looking after than you do..."

[Kid]
What should we do...?


37 :

{S1A213}
[Y¤u]
...Oh, that's right.

Y¤u muttered...

She searched around in her pocket
for something.

And she took out a...


38 :

{S1A214}
[Y¤u]
Drum roll please! Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat. Ta-da.


{S1A215}
[Y¤u]
A marker!

It was just a felt-tipped pen.


39 :

{S1A216}
[Y¤u]
"See this? You take it like this... then do
this... around and around and around..."

As she said that, Y¤u screwed the capped
end into the space between the doors.

A gap appeared.


40 :

{S1A217}
[Y¤u]
See?


41 :
I jabbed my finger into the gap and
started forcing the door open.


42 :
The box inside (the part where people ride) was
stuck right before arriving at Dritter Stock.

Above the door, jutting out some 50 centimeters or
so, was the lower bit of the elevator box.

It was at a height where if I stretched my hand
out completely, it would just reach.

If we could get the box open, then it seemed
possible to pull the people trapped inside over
to our side.


43 :

{S1A218}
[Y¤u]
Shoulder ride.

Y¤u's one sentence said it all.


44 :
As she implied, I stood in front of her
and spread my legs, bracing myself.


{S1A219}
[Y¤u]
Hey! Why do I have to lift you up?


45 :
[Kid]
Huh?


{S1A220}
[Y¤u]
I meant the opposite way around...


{S1A221}
[Y¤u]
"In this type of situation, it's the stronger
person that's on the bottom, right?"


46 :
I went around behind Y¤u, wordlessly squatting
down.

Y¤u was wearing a skirt, after all.

(One reason I tried to be on top was I thought
I would save her the embarrassment...)

As I was thinking that, Y¤u straddled my
head with her legs.

I put both my hands on my knees, supporting
myself, and stood up all at once.

Her soft thighs hugged on my head.

She was pressed against the back of my neck.


It was kind of nice...


{S1A222}
[Y¤u]
Wait! Hold on! We're almost there!


{S1A223}
[???]
Please help.

Y¤u took the marker and started prying it
between the doors again.

She stuck her finger in the gap.

And then she opened the door with a flourish.


47 :

{S1A224}
[???]
Wow~

With Y¤u on my shoulders, I looked up.

A girl in a uniform was peeking down.


{S1A225}
[???]
Whoa!


{S1A226}
[Y¤u]
Ahhh!


48 :
[Kid]
Ahhh!

I didn't know why, but all three of us
exclaimed at once.


49 :
Just then, I felt something like an electric
shock run through me.

Severe lights went off in my mind, and I heard
the sound of something snapping.

I was suddenly dizzy.

I lost my sense of balance and swayed forward
and back.


50 :
My vision and consciousness were overrun
by white.

I couldn't take any more...


{S1A227}
[Y¤u]
Kyaaaa!

I fell to the floor like a marionette with its
strings snipped.


51 :

{S1A228}
[Y¤u]
Ouch, geez...


{S1A229}
[Y¤u]
"Why'd you fall like that? You could have hurt
someone!"


{S1A230}
[Y¤u]
Geez. Lazy. Kids these days are so lazy...


52 :
Things began to fall back into focus.

I was lying on my back, looking at the ceiling.

The lights were shining down brightly.


53 :

{S1A231}
[???]
Wahahaha...

The girls...

The girls were pointing at me and laughing.

Their innocent faces were enveloped in
celestial-like light.

Just like a couple of angels... staring
down from heaven.


{S1A232}
[???]
Hey, are you alright?

I didn't know why...

It was a bizarre sense of something like
déjà vu that came welling up in my mind.

I felt like I had seen it all before.


The angelic, smiling faces somehow made me feel
nostalgic...

Like it was a fragment of some familiar
everyday scenery...

I couldn't explain it, but somehow I had that
vague sense about things.


{S1A233}
[???]
"Huh? Why is the floor all wet? Did a water 
pipe burst?"

(Oh, they don't know because they've been
stuck in the elevator.)

As I was about to answer, the girl cut me off.


{S1A234}
[???]
But more importantly...


54 :

{S1A235}
[???]
...Just what are you doing here, Nakkyu!?

The girl said that as she descended from the
elevator, patting her clothes back into place.


55 :

{S1A236}
[Y¤u]
I should be asking you that!


{S1A237}
[Y¤u]
Mayo, what are you doing here!?

Mayo? The girl's name was Mayo?


56 :

{S1A238}
[Mayo]
"Whaddya mean? If you'd take a look at my 
outfit, you'd know."


57 :

{S1A239}
[Y¤u]
You're on a school trip?


58 :

{S1A240}
[Mayo]
That's for seniors.


59 :

{S1A241}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, right... Mayo, you're still a junior, 
yeah?"


60 :

{S1A242}
[Mayo]
Right.


61 :

{S1A243}
[Y¤u]
So what then?


62 :

{S1A244}
[Mayo]
"Have you forgotten everything about your 
old high school already?"


63 :

{S1A245}
[Y¤u]
Huh?


64 :

{S1A246}
[Mayo]
Volunteer activities!


{S1A247}
[Mayo]
"At Kyumeikan, juniors are supposed to go 
out and volunteer somewhere, right?"


{S1A248}
[Mayo]
"Nakkyu, you just graduated this year, so you've
gotta remember, right?"


65 :

{S1A249}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that's right, the volunteer program!


{S1A250}
[Y¤u]
The Civil Service Volunteer Program.


66 :

{S1A251}
[Y¤u]
"Well... That was the official name, but it was
really just a glorified field trip."


{S1A252}
[Y¤u]
It's still the same old deal, I bet.


{S1A253}
[Y¤u]
"The girls go 'help' out at LeMU for a day, or
something stupid like that."


67 :

{S1A254}
[Mayo]
You got it.


{S1A255}
[Y¤u]
"When I was there, we went to United Land...
but I guess they changed it to LeMU, huh?"


{S1A256}
[Mayo]
"You didn't see any other students,
did you, Nakkyu?"


{S1A257}
[Mayo]
"The whole Kyumeikan junior class 
should be here."


68 :

{S1A258}
[Y¤u]
No. I didn't see anyone.


69 :
While the two of them were talking, I decided
to take a peek at the elevator that Mayo was
stuck in.

I grabbed onto the entrance of the box and
used my momentum to pull myself up.

It was empty inside.

(I thought I heard two girls inside...)


(I wonder if my mind was playing tricks on me.)


70 :
I let go of the elevator and dropped to
the floor.


71 :

{S1A259}
[Y¤u]
Hey? What are you doing?

Y¤u asked me that when I returned to
the ground.

72 :
{11:0-30}
{11:1}Ask Y¤u

{11:1}Don't ask Y¤u


73 :
[Kid]
Well, before... Didn't you hear two voices?


74 :

{S1A260}
[Y¤u]
Two?


75 :
Y¤u shot the question right back at me and then
looked back at Mayo.


76 :

{S1A261}
[Mayo]
No. I was all alone.


77 :

{S1A262}
[Mayo]
Nobody else...

[Kid]
I see...


78 :
[Kid]
"I guess it was just my mind playing tricks
on me..."


79 :
[Kid]
No... No big deal.


80 :

{S1A263}
[Y¤u]
"No big deal? You suddenly start doing 
chin-ups on the elevator, and then you 
say it's no big deal?"

[Kid]
"It must have just been my imagination. Forget
about it."


81 :

{S1A264}
[Y¤u]
"Now, now... Why aren't all youngsters as
easygoing as you these days?"

Y¤u shrugged her shoulders in an
exaggerated way.


82 :
[Mayo]
...

It seemed like Mayo was having a little trouble
deciding how to react to Y¤u's behavior.


83 :
Mayo would glance at me from time to time,
but when our eyes met she would look away.


84 :

{S1A265}
[Mayo]
Uhh... Um...


85 :

{S1A266}
[Mayo]
Nakkyu? Who's this...?


{S1A267}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Oh, this guy?


{S1A268}
[Y¤u]
He's... just a visitor.


{S1A269}
[Y¤u]
"We just met a while ago... But you know, a lot
has happened since then."


86 :

{S1A270}
[Mayo]
Nice to meet you.

There was something a little off about Mayo's
greeting.


87 :

{S1A271}
[Y¤u]
And this is Mayo.


{S1A272}
[Y¤u]
She goes to your old high school?

[Kid]
Nice to meet you too.

But then again, my words were pretty
stiff as well.


88 :

{S1A273}
[Y¤u]
But her real name is Matsunaga Sara...

[Kid]
Sara...? So why Mayo?


{S1A274}
[Y¤u]
Matsunaga Sara.


{S1A275}
[Y¤u]
Tuna Sara.


{S1A276}
[Y¤u]
A tuna salad is loaded with...?


89 :

{S1A277}
[Sara]
Mayonnaise... At least for Nakkyu it is.

[Kid]
Ha. I see.

I said that, but I still didn't really get it.

I had the feeling that simple salad
dressing was better suited to tuna salad.

Well, whatever. It wasn't important.


90 :

{S1A278}
[Sara]
By the way... Um... Your name is...?

[Kid]
N-name...


{S1A279}
[Sara]
Yeah. Your name.

[Kid]
My... My... My name is...


91 :

{S1A280}
[Y¤u]
He says he can't remember.


92 :

{S1A281}
[Sara]
What?


93 :

{S1A282}
[Y¤u]
Amnesia, that's what.


94 :

{S1A283}
[Sara]
Amnesia...?


95 :

{S1A284}
[Sara]
...Really?

[Kid]
Ye-yes...


96 :

{S1A285}
[Sara]
Oh wow. Cool.


97 :
[Kid]
Wow?


{S1A286}
[Sara]
"That's kind of cool, isn't it? I mean, like,
amnesia."


{S1A287}
[Sara]
"It sounds kind of like an international man of
mystery kind of thing."


98 :

{S1A288}
[Sara]
"Like maybe... You could be being hunted by an
underground organization, or assassins, or
something."


99 :
[Kid]
Assassins...

[Kid]
I-I wouldn't kill anybody!


100 :

{S1A289}
[Y¤u]
"I keep trying to tell you not to take 
things so seriously."


101 :

{S1A290}
[Sara]
Huh. Amnesia...


102 :

{S1A291}
[Sara]
You really do have it? That amnesia thing.

Sara kept staring at me as if I were something
exotic.

Like I were an angel...

Replete with a set of wings on my back.

The divine and nostalgic feeling from
before had vanished like an illusion.


103 :
The three of us aimed for an exit.

Understandably, Sara couldn't hide her surprise
when she saw how the complex had changed.



104 :

{S1A292}
[Sara]
What's this?


{S1A293}
[Sara]
Why is this whole place flooded?


105 :

{S1A294}
[Sara]
And there doesn't seem to be anyone around...


106 :
While we walked, Y¤u brought Sara up to speed
with the situation.

'Y¤u was working at LeMU on a part-time basis.'


'I collapsed at the kiosk.'

'After falling down, I was hauled to the infirmary.'


After finishing the story, Y¤u went on.


107 :

{S1A295}
[Y¤u]
"And then, you know, suddenly the alarm started
ringing..."

[Kid]
Alarm?


108 :

{S1A296}
[Y¤u]
What? I didn't tell you about this yet?

[Kid]
Owwww...


109 :

{S1A297}
[Y¤u]
"While you were out, they rang the emergency
evacuation alarm."


110 :

{S1A298}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know why... but it said, 'Anyway,
everyone please escape', or something like 
that."


111 :

{S1A299}
[Y¤u]
Mayo, you heard it, right?


112 :

{S1A300}
[Sara]
Yes.


{S1A301}
[Sara]
"The elevator suddenly stopped... and I got 
stuck inside..."


113 :

{S1A302}
[Sara]
"I think it was right after that when 
I heard the alarm."


114 :

{S1A303}
[Y¤u]
"And then there were three other staff members 
and myself in the infirmary..."


{S1A304}
[Y¤u]
"The other three said they would go out to 
check what was going on and never came back. 
I waited, but nobody returned."


{S1A305}
[Y¤u]
"The only two people left in the room were 
us two..."


115 :
[Kid]
.........


116 :

{S1A306}
[Y¤u]
I couldn't just abandon you there...


117 :

{S1A307}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, at that point, I wasn't really even that
worried."


{S1A308}
[Y¤u]
"I figured probably some kid had just gone and
pushed the emergency alarm button... That was 
all I thought was going on."


118 :

{S1A309}
[Sara]
"I figured that even with a prank, it must be 
serious for them to sound the emergency 
evacuation warning..."


119 :

{S1A310}
[Y¤u]
Well, now that you mention it, I suppose so...


{S1A311}
[Y¤u]
But at that time I was just, I don't know...


{S1A312}
[Y¤u]
I was worried about this kid...

[Kid]
You were worried about me?


120 :

{S1A313}
[Y¤u]
Well, sure...


121 :

{S1A314}
[Sara]
And? Then what happened?


122 :
Everything after that was old news to me.

The closing of the watertight doors.

Our search for the emergency stairs to the
floating island.

And of course, Y¤u also told Sara about how
we got washed away by flood water...


123 :
After that...

Y¤u, Sara and I did a complete check of Dritter
Stock's corridors.

But...


124 :
We met with a dead end...


125 :
And a dead end...


126 :
And a dead end...


127 :
And a dead end...


128 :
And a dead end...


129 :
After dead end...


130 :
And the final place that we ended up...

Was in front of a small door at the end of a
narrow corridor.

In the middle, the word 'HIMMEL' was engraved.


[Kid]
What is this...?


131 :

{S1A315}
[Y¤u]
"Hmmm. Good question. This is the first 
time I've been here..."


132 :
Saying that, Y¤u took hold of the door knob.

It didn't open...

It didn't even budge.


133 :
Next she started tapping randomly on the
ten-key display next to the door.

Y¤u should have known that it was a waste of
energy...


134 :

{S1A316}
[Y¤u]
Haaaaaa...


{S1A317}
[Y¤u]
So this is the end...

Y¤u punctuated that with a sigh.


135 :

{S1A318}
[Sara]
The end... You mean we're...


136 :

{S1A319}
[Y¤u]
Yup...


{S1A320}
[Y¤u]
It looks like we're locked in...


137 :
Gong.

Y¤u weakly kicked the door.

Following the sound, we went silent.

The atmosphere around us was heavy.

Both Y¤u and Sara wore tired expressions, as if
they couldn't even be bothered to speak
anymore.

It was a gloomy silence.

To try to lighten things up, I said...

[Kid]
"Hey, anyway, it doesn't do us any good to just
stand around here!"

[Kid]
We've gotta think of something!


138 :

{S1A321}
[Sara]
Something?

[Kid]
A way to escape!


139 :

{S1A322}
[Y¤u]
You have any bright ideas?

[Kid]
Well, let's see... How about...

140 :
{11:0-32}
{11:1}Try to contact the outside

{11:1}Look for other exits


141 :
[Kid]
"For example, we could try to contact the 
outside or something."


142 :

{S1A323}
[Sara]
How? Cell phones don't even work...

[Kid]
"Even without a cell phone, LeMU must have 
other means of communicating, right?"


143 :

{S1A324}
[Y¤u]
Means... of communication...?


144 :

{S1A325}
[Y¤u]
Oh, right! The control room!


145 :
[Kid]
"For example, we could look for other exits or
something."


146 :

{S1A326}
[Sara]
"Anything else? Hello? You know we're in the
middle of the ocean, right?"

[Kid]
"I know. I'm not saying we try to escape out of
a window or anything."

[Kid]
Nothing like that...

[Kid]
"If this is the middle of the ocean, then there
must be a duct for outside air. So..."


147 :

{S1A327}
[Sara]
"Oh, I see. So you're saying that we use that
ventilation duct to escape? Like they always 
do in movies."

[Kid]
Yeah. That's what I mean.


148 :

{S1A328}
[Y¤u]
Sorry, but there's no way that's possible.

[Kid]
Huh? Why not?


{S1A329}
[Y¤u]
"The ducts that go to the outside aren't big
enough for people to pass through."


149 :
[Kid]
No... No way...

My shoulders slumped in disappointment.

Sara's face was also covered in dejection.


{S1A330}
[Sara]
"I wish I could at least contact my friends
outside..."


150 :

{S1A331}
[Y¤u]
Contact outside...?


{S1A332}
[Sara]
But cell phones don't even work...


151 :

{S1A333}
[Y¤u]
Oh, right! The control room!


152 :

{S1A334}
[Y¤u]
Why didn't I think of this until now?


{S1A335}
[Y¤u]
"From there, we should at least be able to 
contact someone on the floating island."

Y¤u's face lit up again.


153 :
Next, light returned to Sara's eyes as well.


154 :
But...


155 :
‡LCrash!


156 :
Y¤u did a fantastic heel stomp on the console
in the control room.


{S1A336}
[Y¤u]
What's this? Why won't it go through?


{S1A337}
[Y¤u]
What's the matter?

It looked like she was going to rant.

No, she was already ranting...


{S1A338}
[Sara]
Hey, hey! Nakkyu, wait a second!

[Kid]
"Hey, what are you going to do with 
that chair!?"


{S1A339}
[Y¤u]
"I'm going to smash it into this stupid 
machine!"


{S1A340}
[Y¤u]
"I'm going to destroy it! Crush it into smithereens!
Absolutely pulverize it!"


{S1A341}
[Sara]
Ta-take it easy! Just calm down!


{S1A342}
[Y¤u]
"How do you expect me to stay calm in a 
situation like this?"


{S1A343}
[Y¤u]
"How can all of the communication lines 
be down!?"


{S1A344}
[Y¤u]
"E-mail, too. Even the emergency line won't go
through!"


{S1A345}
[Y¤u]
Is this possible?


{S1A346}
[Y¤u]
I don't get it! Something's wrong here!

[Kid]
Still, you don't have to destroy...


{S1A347}
[Y¤u]
Shut up! I've... had enough! Kyaaaa!

Sara and I restrained Y¤u and dragged her
outside the control room.


157 :

{S1A348}
[Y¤u]
*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*...

Y¤u's eyes were bloodshot like a rabid dog.

Somehow, her fantasy-like outfit seemed out of
place.

[Kid]
"Well, if it's come to this, there's nothing
else to do..."

[Kid]
"Let's just... split up again and look 
for an exit."


158 :

{S1A349}
[Y¤u]
"It's no use! After we already looked 
everywhere!?"

[Kid]
But we haven't looked inside the rooms.


159 :

{S1A350}
[Sara]
I see.


{S1A351}
[Sara]
"There might be something like a secret passage
hidden or something..."


{S1A352}
[Y¤u]
"There's no way. This isn't a ninja house,
you know."

[Kid]
"Anyway, let's just... look one more time,
alright?"


160 :

{S1A353}
[Sara]
"Because there might be a helpless maiden
trapped somewhere like I was."


161 :

{S1A354}
[Sara]
Nin! Nin! Ninja!


162 :
So with that, the three of us (Sara, Y¤u, and I)
split up and started searching the complex.

We agreed we'd meet again in an hour...

We decided to meet in front of the control room.
