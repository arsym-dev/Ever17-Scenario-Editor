{C2T000}
[Sora]
Someone has to 'see' me.


{C2T001}
[Sora]
I have to be seen in order to exist.


{C2T002}
[Sora]
Vision‡La viewpoint.


{C2T003}
[Sora]
Someone's perspective actually creates me.


{C2T004}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san...


{C2T005}
[Sora]
When you close your eyes, I disappear.

2 :
{11:0-7a}
{11:2-d0}Try it

{11:1}.........


3 :
[Takeshi]
.........

I said nothing and did nothing.

No, it would be better to say that I couldn't
say or do anything.

It was hard for me to grasp the meaning of
Sora's words.


4 :
Going into the room, I could hear the beeping
of the console, indicating someone was
calling.


5 :

{T2C238}
[Sora]
Well, Kuranari-san...


{T2C239}
[Sora]
"LeMMIH is calling for me, so I will leave 
and then come back shortly."


6 :
And saying that, Sora disappeared.

Only the three-dimensional hologram depicting
LeMU hovered silently in the darkness.



7 :
[Takeshi]
When I close my eyes...?

I decided to test it and covered my eyes with
one hand.

8 :
Instantly, Sora vanished.

If Sora did exist, I should have been able to
see her head above my hand and her feet below.

But Sora wasn't there.

My hand kept the laser from reaching my eye,
so I couldn't see Sora.

Something about it made her seem fragile and
temporary. It scared me.

I quickly put down my hand.


9 :
She appeared without a sound.

She smiled gently.

[Takeshi]
Sora...?


{C2T006}
[Sora]
Yes...?

There was no real meaning in my question.

Maybe it was just that I wanted to see whether
or not she would answer me.

Given her fragile existence, there seemed to
be a danger that she might slip away at any
moment...

I was uneasy about it, and at the same time
felt a sort of awe about the mystery of it.


10 :

{C2T007}
[Sora]
"Is there anything else? Please don't stare 
at me like that."

Sora was blushing.

[Takeshi]
Oh... No. Nothing else.


11 :
Sora pinched her lips closed as if she was
slightly embarrassed.


{C2T008}
[Sora]
By the way, Kuranari-san...

[Takeshi]
Yeah?


12 :

{C2T009}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... Have you ever seen the moon?

The question came out of nowhere.

But it was one that caused me to burst out
laughing.

[Takeshi]
Hahaha! Yeah, of course I have.

I replied immediately.


13 :

{C2T010}
[Sora]
"Well, now let's say that you have seen a full 
moon."


{C2T011}
[Sora]
"And let's say that you closed your eyes. Do 
you think the moon would still be there?"

[Takeshi]
Why are you asking such obvious questions?

[Takeshi]
Of course it would.


14 :

{C2T012}
[Sora]
"And how about if everyone in the world closed 
their eyes all at the same time?"

[Takeshi]
"I don't know what your point is, but... even if 
everyone in the world closed their eyes, the 
moon wouldn't disappear."


15 :

{C2T013}
[Sora]
Really?

[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{C2T014}
[Sora]
How can you be sure?

[Takeshi]
Just open your eyes, right?


16 :

{C2T015}
[Sora]
"That goes against the purpose of this 
exercise."


{C2T016}
[Sora]
"My question was whether or not there is 
any way of verifying that the moon exists 
if someone closes their eyes."

[Takeshi]
?


{C2T017}
[Sora]
"When you close your eyes, do you think this 
world still exists?"


{C2T018}
[Sora]
"What if I told you that not only myself, but 
all of LeMU was nothing but an RSD-generated 
illusion... What would you do then?"

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


{C2T019}
[Sora]
"Can you prove that the walls, the ceiling, 
and all of the scenery that you are 
observing actually exist?"

(So everything I'm looking at... is RSD...?)


I panicked, glancing around at my surroundings.


17 :

{C2T020}
[Sora]
Haha, I'm sorry. I was only joking.

[Takeshi]
That's a joke?


{C2T021}
[Sora]
Yes. LeMU really does exist.


{C2T022}
[Sora]
"You sounded so full of confidence when you 
answered... I thought I would tease you just 
a bit."

Sora giggled, covering her mouth.


18 :

{C2T023}
[Sora]
However, I can say this.


{C2T024}
[Sora]
"For humans to know the world around them, 
they must use one of their five senses."


{C2T025}
[Sora]
"If they lose all of these, they lose the 
ability to tell whether this world exists 
or not."


19 :

{C2T026}
[Sora]
"Another way of putting it might be to say 
that the perspective is in the eye of the 
beholder."


{C2T027}
[Sora]
"In this instance, I don't mean just sight, 
but hearing, smell, taste, and touch as well. All of 
the senses."


{C2T028}
[Sora]
"The point at which we perceive the world‡Lthat 
is perspective."


20 :

{C2T029}
[Sora]
And I...


21 :

{C2T030}
[Sora]
I... I am the same as the moon.


{C2T031}
[Sora]
Do you understand?

I felt like I had been able to get the gist of
what she meant.

Still... I didn't know exactly what she meant
by 'I am the same as the moon.'

I mustered an image of a silvery blue moon,
its light piercing through the dark night.


22 :
(I see... That's what she means.)

The answer came to me surprisingly quickly.

The moon didn't bark like a dog, it didn't
smell, and it didn't taste tart like an
apple, at least not as far as I knew.

The only way to be sure of the existence of
the moon was through its small gravitational
pull and its blue-white light.

Thinking of it in that way, the mysterious
charm of the moon and its transience were
things that Sora shared.

I believed the moon was there, so it was
there...

I believed that Sora was there, so she was
there...

Maybe that was what Sora wanted to say.


23 :
[Takeshi]
Aah, I got it.

That was how I answered.


24 :
Sora's eyes lit up and her cheeks wrinkled
into a big smile.

And it might have been my imagination,
but I thought I smelled the tart scent of an apple
from somewhere.


25 :
After seeing Sora off to the control room...

I didn't have anything in particular to do,
so I wandered aimlessly down the corridors of
Dritter Stock.

Ahead of me, I could see the door leading to
the Lemurian Ruins. The door was open.

Walking by, I glanced briefly inside.

I saw someone.


26 :
(Huh? Who's that?)

27 :
{11:0-7c}
{11:1}I was curious

{11:1}I didn't really care


28 :
I was curious, so I ducked inside the room
with the ruins.


29 :
(Hmm. Who is in here?)


30 :
(Ah... Who cares?)

Not paying it any more of my attention, I
quickly passed by the entrance.


31 :
And letting my legs lead the way, I roamed
without any destination in mind. Eventually, I
ended up resting on a bed in the infirmary,
staring out into the ocean depths...

And before I knew it, a few hours had passed...


32 :
It turned out the figures in the room were
Y¤u and £o¢o.


33 :
Y¤u had been leaning up against the stone wall.

In the palm of Y¤u's hand was... some kind of
journal or notebook. She had it opened and
was staring at a page.

£o¢o was standing next to her, peering
over her shoulder.

The two of them were flush up against one
another, speaking in two and three word
sentences. They looked like they were having
fun.


{PIPI_09}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*, *woof*!

From out of nowhere, Pipi appeared and rushed
up to my legs.

I lifted up the sopping wet Pipi and went
over to stand by the two girls.

[Takeshi]
What'cha looking at?

I stood beside them and asked.


34 :
Y¤u and £o¢o looked up and noticed me.


{C2T032}
[£o¢o]
"Um, uh, we were, um, looking at these 
pictures."

[Takeshi]
Pictures?


{C2T033}
[Y¤u]
You want to see them?

[Takeshi]
Sure.


{C2T034}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll show you.


35 :
What Y¤u handed over to me was neither a
journal nor notebook, but a single file.

One small enough to fit in the palm of my hand.

It was already open, and it had several pictures
taken from an instant camera stuffed between
the pages.

They were baby pictures.

[Takeshi]
It can't be...

[Takeshi]
Your baby!?


36 :

{C2T035}
[Y¤u]
Nooo, stupid!


37 :
Y¤u hit me on the head.


38 :

{C2T036}
[Y¤u]
I'm eighteen, okay? And I'm single. Single!

[Takeshi]
Yeah right...

[Takeshi]
Which means that this baby is...?


39 :

{C2T037}
[£o¢o]
It's Nakkyu, dummy.


{C2T038}
[£o¢o]
"These are from when Nakkyu was a little bitty 
baby!"

[Takeshi]
So this is what you were laughing about?


{C2T039}
[Y¤u]
Something wrong with that?


40 :

{C2T040}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, they're adorable, right? My baby 
pictures."


{C2T041}
[Y¤u]
"Uh, and of course the fact that I'm cute 
hasn't changed a bit, you know."

[Takeshi]
.........


41 :

{C2T042}
[Y¤u]
Oh, and... um... can you hand those back?

And saying that, Y¤u snatched the file out of
my hands...


42 :

{C2T043}
[Y¤u]
"This picture is from when I was dressed up 
in a kimono as a kid..."


{C2T044}
[Y¤u]
"And in this, I was head cheerleader for an 
athletic event at school."


{C2T045}
[Y¤u]
"And... Oh, this one's from my first day of 
middle school."

Y¤u continued to flip through the pages.


43 :

{C2T046}
[Y¤u]
"And here's one that I took at the talent 
show my freshman year in high school."


{C2T047}
[Y¤u]
"Here's Keiko, Min-min, Betty, Chi-chan, Beef 
Yamamoto... Oh, and I couldn't forget my 
teacher, right?"


{C2T048}
[Y¤u]
"And the fireworks festival... Here's my 
trip to the hot springs... Oh! And one from 
that time I stayed at Ami-chan's!"


44 :

{C2T049}
[Y¤u]
And here we have... Huh? What is this?


45 :

{C2T050}
[Y¤u]
"Oooh, that's riiight. This is when we 
sneaked into school that one night..."


{C2T051}
[Y¤u]
"And of course, the graduation ceremony... 
There was one more... Uuummm..."


46 :

{C2T052}
[Y¤u]
"Here it is, heh heh. It's hideous, right? 
I'd been crying and crying..."

So much of Y¤u's history was there...

Smiling faces, sad faces, silly faces,
surprised faces, even shy faces...

There were girlfriends, boyfriends, teachers,
people, afternoons, nights, good times, and
hard times...

It went without saying, but shown in those
photos were people I didn't know, places I
didn't know, and a Y¤u that I didn't know.


{C2T053}
[Y¤u]
Oh, and, and...

Y¤u looked like she had no intention of
stopping, so I rushed to get a word in.

[Takeshi]
"Um, Y¤u? So what is this, your life's 
history album or something?"


47 :

{C2T054}
[Y¤u]
"A history album... Well, I've never called it 
that before..."


{C2T055}
[Y¤u]
"But if you had to label it, I guess you 
could call it that."

[Takeshi]
Uh, so why are you carrying that with you?


{C2T056}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Why do you even need to ask?


48 :

{C2T057}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you don't know? All girls carry 
around things like this. It's normal."

[Takeshi]
You don't say?


49 :

{C2T058}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


{C2T059}
[£o¢o]
Well, all the girls I know carry them around.


50 :
Come to think about it, I'd heard rumors of
something like that before.

But I wouldn't have expected it to be
anything more than a fleeting fad. There was
no way I had any idea it was a deep-rooted
girl tradition.

The album had probably been with Y¤u's
things from the changing room.
I wonder what everyone is doing right about
now...

51 :

{C2T060}
[Y¤u]
"I wonder what everyone is doing right about 
now..."


Y¤u murmured softly to herself as she flipped
through the pages.


{C2T061}
[Y¤u]
Do any of these people ever worry about me?

[Takeshi]
.........


52 :

{C2T062}
[£o¢o]
Oh yeah...


{C2T063}
[£o¢o]
Do you live with your mom and dad, Takepyon?

[Takeshi]
Eh?


{C2T064}
[£o¢o]
Or do you live by yourself?

53 :
{11:0-7e}
{11:1}I'm living with my parents

{11:1}I live alone


54 :
[Takeshi]
I'm living with my parents.


{C2T065}
[£o¢o]
"So I'll bet your mom and dad are worried 
about you."

[Takeshi]
"Well, they're parents. Parents worry, it's 
what they're good at..."

[Takeshi]
"Buuut, that's only if they know we're stuck 
in here."


{C2T066}
[£o¢o]
Well, they've got to know.


{C2T067}
[£o¢o]
"An accident as big as this? It's probably 
all over the news. They might even be doing a 
huge TV special about it."


55 :
[Takeshi]
I live alone.

[Takeshi]
"I get a phone call every couple of months 
from home, and I don't really call them much 
myself."

[Takeshi]
"So... there's probably no way that my 
parents know that I'm trapped in a place like 
this."


56 :

{C2T068}
[Y¤u]
That's not true! They've got to know.


{C2T069}
[Y¤u]
"An accident as big as this? It's probably 
all over the newspapers and television."


57 :
[Takeshi]
You think so? I'm not sure about that...


58 :
Y¤u kept flipping through the pages.

It didn't seem like she was very interested
in what I had to say.

[Takeshi]
"How about you, £o¢o? You're probably still 
living with your parents, aren't you?"


59 :

{C2T070}
[£o¢o]
Well, I'm fourteen, aren't I? Of course I am.


60 :

{C2T071}
[£o¢o]
"Ah, well, right now my dad isn't at home, 
but..."

[Takeshi]
Hmm? Why not?


61 :

{C2T072}
[£o¢o]
"Because he's on a 'business trip', that's 
why."

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.


62 :
[Takeshi]
"And what about you, Y¤u? Are you living with 
your parents, or..."


63 :
(Oh! Duh! Why did I ask that!?)‡LI realized
it'd been a mistake to ask that.

Y¤u's dad had been missing for seventeen years.


I checked Y¤u's expression.

But it didn't seem as if she cared one way or
another.


64 :

{C2T073}
[Y¤u]
I'm living with my mom.


{C2T074}
[Y¤u]
But I doubt she's really worried about me.


{C2T075}
[Y¤u]
"That's just the kind of person she is, my 
mom..."

[Takeshi]
What do you mean?


{C2T076}
[Y¤u]
"I guess you could call her a positive 
thinker... She isn't the type to really let 
herself get caught up in things."


{C2T077}
[Y¤u]
She doesn't care if I stay out all night...


{C2T078}
[Y¤u]
"I've been living with her for eighteen years... but 
she's never raised her voice at me once."


{C2T079}
[Y¤u]
"I grew up pretty much doing whatever I 
wanted."


65 :

{C2T080}
[Y¤u]
"I suppose that's why I turned out the way I 
did."


66 :
Y¤u showed me a page from her album that she'd
turned to.

There was Y¤u, putting the hurt on some
wrestler.

And the guy looked like a bulky jock of sorts.


{C2T081}
[Y¤u]
So...

Y¤u said that as she snapped the album shut.


67 :

{C2T082}
[Y¤u]
Hey, £o¢o? You want to go take a nap?


{C2T083}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know why, but... *yaaawn*... I'm kind 
of tired all of a sudden..."


{C2T084}
[£o¢o]
Okay, let's take a nap.


68 :

{C2T085}
[Y¤u]
I wonder why I'm so tired this early?


{C2T086}
[Y¤u]
Right, £o¢o?


{C2T087}
[£o¢o]
Right, Nakkyu?


69 :
Y¤u and £o¢o looked over at me disapprovingly
and... left the room fighting off yawns.


Holding Pipi, I watched the two disappear from
sight.
