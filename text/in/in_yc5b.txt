1 :
‡LThe hologram pendant.

I thought back to the image in Sara's hologram
pendant.

(That means... the image in the pendant...
was of a DIFFERENT Kuranari Takeshi...)

(And Tsugumi... has infrared vision like Sara
and me...)

(Which means... Which means...)

(Our parents are...)


2 :

{C5A317}
[Tsugumi]
What is it?


{C5A318}
[Sora]
Are you alright, Kid-san?


{C5A319}
[Sora]
You don't look so good...

I shook my head and shivered as I stepped
slowly backward.

My back bumped against the wall.

[Kid]
It can't be...


{C5A320}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

[Kid]
No! No! No!


3 :
I let out a cry that was almost a scream.

Swinging around, I opened the door and ran
out of the control room...


4 :
I wanted to get as far away as I could.

I wanted to find a place where no one could
find me.


5 :
I pounded up the emergency stairs.


6 :
I ran forward in a dark haze.

I ran as if I could escape the fear that
threatened to overwhelm me...

Farther and farther away...

But in that confined space, there was nowhere
I could run away to.

Eventually, I reached the end of the corridor.


7 :
And ended up in front of the Jellyfish
Gondola‡L

There was no way past the closed watertight doors.

I stood in front of a decorated arch.

The gondola had to be somewhere beyond the
gates, which were veiled in darkness.

In the gondola, Tsugumi and the real
Kuranari Takeshi...

(It's impossible!)

I tried to purge the thought from my mind.

But the suspicion mercilessly attacked my
brain until I could no longer think straight.

The battle between denial and acceptance... I
writhed in pain, sinking further into a
trench of despair.

In my mind, there was only one possibility.

I was almost convinced of the certainty of it.


On the other hand, I hated the possibility so
much that I wanted with all of my heart to
reject it.

I put my hand on my chest, breathing in
deeply, and tried to calm my thoughts.

If it was true that Tsugumi had infrared
vision...

And if the incident I witnessed in the
Jellyfish Gondola really did happen...

The Kuranari Takeshi and Komachi Tsugumi who
had existed in the other world...

Would be...

Our parents.

(No! It can't be!)

I was once again overwhelmed by feelings of
denial.

Sara and I were sixteen.

If Tsugumi had given birth to us, then it
would have been sixteen years ago...


8 :
[Kid]
Huh?

I suddenly felt as if I had been hit by
lightning.

My head was filled with a blinding light.

Suddenly kicking off the floor, I broke into
a run.


9 :
It was 2017, so sixteen years prior would have
been 2001.

The world I had seen was 2000...


Wait a minute...

What if...

If the year wasn't 2017...


10 :
I opened the door of the security office and
stumbled into the room.

As I suspected, I found Y¤u there.

[Kid]
Y¤u!

Breathing heavily, I approached Y¤u.


11 :

{C5A321}
[Y¤u]
Wh-what is it!?


{C5A322}
[Y¤u]
What is it...? What's wrong?

[Kid]
This year...

[Kid]
What... year is it?


12 :

{C5A323}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
Just answer me!

Y¤u blinked slowly, her mouth half-open.


[Kid]
Well?

I glared at Y¤u and pressed her for an answer.

A little overwhelmed by my enthusiasm, Y¤u
seemed a bit disconcerted.


13 :

{C5A324}
[Y¤u]
On the standard calendar...


{C5A325}
[Y¤u]
20...


{C5A326}
[Y¤u]
...34. Why?


14 :
[Takeshi]
It's 2017...

[Takeshi]
So 2013 was four years ago?

I said to Y¤u.

Y¤u and I were alone in the security office...

Y¤u had suddenly asked me to come see her
and started talking about what had
happened in 2013.

No, I probably had seen it coming.

Just before she had spoken to me, Y¤u had
hinted indirectly that she had changed her
mind and needed someone to confide in.

Her expression was solemn, like a nun about
to seek redemption.

Y¤u's eyes were empty of emotion.

And at the same time, her gaze showed an
unconditional compassion: impartial, demanding
nothing, asking nothing.

After a short while...


{C5A327}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


{C5A328}
[Y¤u]
It was four years ago...


{C5A329}
[Y¤u]
When I was fourteen.

Y¤u began quietly to tell her story...


15 :
Yubiseiharukana had a serious heart condition.

She hadn't been born with it.

In 2013, when she was fourteen, she had suddenly
fallen ill.

One day, Y¤u had suddenly collapsed.

She was examined at the hospital, and the
doctor told her...

[Doctor]
"This is very hard for me to tell you, so I 
want you to please listen calmly."

[Doctor]
You have a very serious heart condition.

[Doctor]
"It's unclear whether you'll even make it to 
the end of high school."

That meant that she only had three or four
more years to live.

A transplant was out of the question. And
even with treatment, she would only suffer,
and they couldn't guarantee her a cure.

There was no way left for her to survive.

She had received a death sentence.

[Doctor]
But medical treatment is advancing daily.

[Doctor]
In a few years, we may still find a cure.

[Doctor]
"So don't give up. You have to fight this 
illness."

With the doctor's hollow consolation,
emptiness took over her mind.


16 :
‡L2014.

Her fear of her approaching death was growing.

One day, while she was at the hospital, she
met a gentleman.

Through the course of their meetings, she and
the gentlemen came to trust one another and
became very close.

It was a close relationship, like the bond
between a parent and a child...

{16:4}

17 :
Between a father and a daughter.


Yubiseiharukana had grown up without knowing a
father's warmth.

Perhaps she was seeking from him the love
from the father she had never known.

As for the gentleman, he had a daughter close
to her age.

When he found out about Y¤u's illness, he
felt as much sympathy as he would have for
his own daughter.

{16:4}

18 :
They were close like a parent and a child,
joined by a strong feeling like love.

Having built up a trust, Yubiseiharukana one
day confessed her fear, her despair, and her agony
to him.

With a serious look on his face, the
gentleman said...

{16:4}

19 :
'Come to my lab.'

{1}

20 :
His name was Morino Shigezo.

Doctor Morino was a world authority in genetic
engineering.

{16:4}

21 :
In November of that year...

After making up her mind, Yubiseiharukana
visited the doctor's lab.

{16:4}

22 :
'There are three types of immortality.'

'The first is immortality of the body.'

'The second is immortality of the memory.'

'The third is immortality of the gene.'

'How would you like to try the third kind...?'

{16:4}

23 :
The doctor presented that extraordinary plan
to her with the calmness of a scientist, his
tone matter-of-fact.

{16:4}

24 :
'Your heart problem was acquired after birth,
rather being something you were born with.'

'So, if you choose the third option...'

'You don't have to worry about passing the
condition on to your 'children'.'

'There is nothing for you to worry about.'

{16:4}

25 :
Ever since being told that she would die, she
had been terrified at the approaching shadow
of death.

Not a night would go by that she didn't rail
against her misfortune, all the while clawing
at her chest in agony.

She had given up on life and was no more
than an empty shell.

{16:4}

26 :
But that day, she was suddenly able to see a
glimmer of hope.

The doctor's words convinced her, and her way
of thinking gradually changed.

'If I only have a few more years to live, I
at least want to leave something of myself
behind in this world.'

Her tenacity for life defied imagination.

{16:4}


27 :
She finally made the decision.

She chose the third option.

{16:4}

28 :
‡LOne month later. December of 2014.

Yubiseiharukana had the nucleus from one of
her own cells implanted in her own ovaries,
which then began to grow in her womb.

Of course, Doctor Morino performed the surgery.


She was pregnant with her 'new self'.

{16:4}

29 :
‡LNine months later. September 22nd, 2015.

Yubiseiharukana safely gave birth.

{16:4}

30 :

{C5A330}
'My baby!'


{C5A331}
'You are my sister.'


{C5A332}
'You are... me, myself.'

{16:4}

31 :
Yubiseiharukana loved the new child with all
of her heart and gave her a name.

She called her 'Yubiseiakikana'.

Yes, Yubiseiakikana was
Yubiseiharukana's daughter.

And at the same time, they were not only
mother and daughter, but also shared the same
genetic design, just like twins.

{16:4}

32 :
What a twist of fate...

Did she do it out of the madness that came
from being so close to death?

But... still...

Look at the lively face of the newborn child!

Look at how pure its smile is! How bright
its new life shines!

{16:4}

33 :
Could anyone watch something as simple as its
earnest attempts to grab something and
believe that the baby was a tragedy?

Was it a sin to create a life? Was it a sin
to want life?

The baby smiled happily. Sometimes, it cried.


As if it were asking, 'Is it a sin to be
alive?'

{16:4}

34 :
‡LMonday, May 1st, 2017.

Yubiseiharukana, who had become a student at
Kyumeikan Women's College, had started
working part-time at LeMU during the holidays.

She wanted to find a clue about her father,
Yoichi, who had gone missing seventeen years ago.

{16:4}

35 :
Her mother, Yukie, kept telling her, 'Your
father fell into the ocean and drowned,' but
Y¤u didn't believe it.

She held onto the hope that he was still
alive somewhere.

She had left her one-year-old daughter,
Yubiseiakikana, with her mother, so she was
not worried about her.

{16:4}

36 :
Yubiseiharukana's heart had almost reached its
limit.

She had given birth safely but could no
longer escape the fate which awaited her.

There was only one thing left that she wanted
to do.

Before she died, she wanted to find out
whether her father was still alive.

{16:4}

37 :
The father who had disappeared when she was a
year old...

She had looked at his photo until it had
become ragged and torn but had no memories
of his warmth or ever having been held by him.

For that reason, she waved off all of the
doctor's attempts to stop her and came
to LeMU.

She wanted to find out about her father...

What had happened seventeen years ago? She
wanted to reveal the truth...

{16:4}

38 :
As her story ended, Y¤u reached for a file
that was on the control panel.

She opened it and silently passed it to me...


39 :
[Takeshi]
So the baby was...

[Takeshi]
WAS your child?


40 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
Which means you were lying to me...


{C5A333}
[Y¤u]
It wasn't... a lie...


{C5A334}
[Y¤u]
She is my daughter...


{C5A335}
[Y¤u]
But she's also my twin sister...


{C5A336}
[Y¤u]
And...


{C5A337}
[Y¤u]
She's another me...


{C5A338}
[Y¤u]
She is... myself...

I didn't know what to say.


{C5A339}
[Y¤u]
This was my sin...


{C5A340}
[Y¤u]
"I know I'll never be forgiven and will 
never be able to atone for it..."


{C5A341}
[Y¤u]
But...


41 :

{C5A342}
[Y¤u]
Like I told you, I have no regrets.


{C5A343}
[Y¤u]
I'm glad I had her...

[Takeshi]
.........


{C5A344}
[Y¤u]
"I'll never forget the moment that new life 
was created."


{C5A345}
[Y¤u]
"It was... such an unbelievably happy 
moment..."


{C5A346}
[Y¤u]
The first time she said 'Mama... Mama...'


{C5A347}
[Y¤u]
I... I can't explain it...


{C5A348}
[Y¤u]
"It was more than a precious feeling, or 
love, or that good fortune had come my 
way... I felt as if I were wrapped in light..."


{C5A349}
[Y¤u]
I don't care if I burn in hell.


{C5A350}
[Y¤u]
"I don't care if I burn in the fires of hell 
for thousands, millions of years..."


{C5A351}
[Y¤u]
"But... I knew I wanted to protect... my 
daughter... no matter what..."


{C5A352}
[Y¤u]
I didn't want her to suffer...


{C5A353}
[Y¤u]
Her smile is so beautiful...


{C5A354}
[Y¤u]
Her tiny hands are so cute...


{C5A355}
[Y¤u]
She is everything to me...


{C5A356}
[Y¤u]
She is irreplaceable...


{C5A357}
[Y¤u]
Besides, none of this is her fault.


{C5A358}
[Y¤u]
"She was welcomed to this world... just like 
any other life born here."


{C5A359}
[Y¤u]
"But at the same time... the moment I gave 
birth to her... I died."


{C5A360}
[Y¤u]
It was as if I no longer existed...


{C5A361}
[Y¤u]
You see...


{C5A362}
[Y¤u]
"I gave all my life, my existence, to my 
child..."


42 :
Y¤u showed me the photograph again.

The baby in the picture was reaching out,
trying to grab something.


43 :

{C5A363}
[Y¤u]
Hey! Hello, are you listening to me?

Y¤u grabbed my shoulders and shook me.


44 :

{C5A364}
[Y¤u]
What's the matter with you, Kid?


{C5A365}
[Y¤u]
"You can't possibly have forgotten what year 
it is, can you?"

Her words made no impression on me.

(What on earth...)

My mouth was dry, and the palm of my clenched
fist was drenched with sweat.

(First of all...)

I began to think things through.

The Y¤u that I knew... The Y¤u standing in
front of me, Yubisei'aki'kana, was born on
the 22nd of September, 2015.

Her mother was Yubiseiharukana.

That meant...

It was 2034, seventeen years after
Yubiseiharukana's time in 2017...

No, but wait...

What about the date on that mail?

It had been received on 02/07/19.

My voice came out strangled.

[Kid]
It's 2034 now...

[Kid]
Yukie-san died fifteen years ago...

[Kid]
Which would have been in 2019...

[Kid]
But the date on that says... '02/07/19'...


45 :

{C5A366}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that?


{C5A367}
[Y¤u]
You were worried about that?

Y¤u laughed.


{C5A368}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I can understand why you might make 
that mistake..."


{C5A369}
[Y¤u]
Do you see?


{C5A370}
[Y¤u]
"The date on that mail was written in the 
German style."


{C5A371}
[Y¤u]
"Not the Japanese order of year/month/day, but 
month/day/year."

[Kid]
So are you telling me that...

[Kid]
That wasn't July 19th, 2002...

[Kid]
It was February 7th, 2019...?

Y¤u nodded.


{C5A372}
[Y¤u]
Any other questions?

I shook my head weakly and trudged out of the
security office.


46 :
I had figured out the relationship between
Y¤u and her mother but wondered whether I
should tell her.

No, I had to tell her. That was better for Y¤u
in the long run.

But first, I had to take care of my own
problems.

There was somewhere I had to go.


47 :

{C5A373}
[Sara]
What is it?


{C5A374}
[Sara]
What did you bring me here for?

[Kid]
I wanted to... talk to you guys alone...


48 :

{C5A375}
[Sara]
About what?

[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi was silent. She seemed to be afraid
of something.

Tsugumi perhaps already sensed what I was
going to say.

Her eyes flew around wildly.


{C5A376}
[Sara]
Is it important?

[Kid]
Yes, very.

[Kid]
"It's something I don't want the others to 
hear..."

[Kid]
"Wait, I don't mind if they hear it, but I 
wanted you and Tsugumi to know first."

[Kid]
So that's why I asked you to come over here.


{C5A377}
[Sara]
Hmmmm...


{C5A378}
[Sara]
So what's so important?

Hadn't Sara noticed anything?

Her blank, unguarded expression...

She had to have noticed something.

On May 1st, after Sara met Tsugumi for the
first time, she had looked totally dazed.

Surely, Sara had sensed something.


To be standing there calmly, she had to be in
denial.

Reason was telling her that what she suspected
couldn't be true.

The coincidence of meeting her mother again
was probably too much for Sara to believe.


{C5A379}
[Sara]
"Well, are you going to say anything? Could 
you hurry up...?"

Sara urged me to get to the point.

Tsugumi said nothing, but her breathing
seemed a little rough.

[Kid]
"Sara? Could you lend me your pendant and 
lighter for a moment?"


{C5A380}
[Sara]
Alright.

She took them out of her pocket and gave them
to me.


49 :
‡LShick.

I struck a flame, illuminating the pendant.


50 :
Takeshi...

That was... the real Kuranari Takeshi...


51 :
I held the pendant and the flame closer to
Tsugumi.

Tsugumi kept her head down, refusing to look
up at the pendant.

Her brow was furrowed, and she was biting her
lip.

Her arms pressed tightly to her sides...

Her clenched fists were shaking.

[Kid]
Look closer...

I whispered to her.

[Kid]
"You've seen this pendant before... haven't 
you?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
It's Takeshi.

[Kid]
The real Kuranari Takeshi is right here!


52 :
The moment I said those words, Tsugumi's eyes
flew open.

Stripped of expression, she wore a face like a
mask... Only her eyes burned with a fierce
light.


53 :

{C5A381}
[Sara]
"W-wait just a minute! What are you talking 
about!?"


{C5A382}
[Sara]
Takeshi... You mean Takeshi!?


{C5A383}
[Sara]
Takeshi's... the one in this pendant!?

[Kid]
Umm, no...

[Kid]
The Takeshi we know isn't the real Kuranari Takeshi.

[Kid]
I think he's lying to us.


54 :

{C5A384}
[Sara]
...?

[Kid]
The real Takeshi...

[Kid]
The real Kuranari Takeshi...

[Kid]
Is your and my...

[Kid]
Father...


55 :
Tsugumi closed her eyes.

She breathed out a long sigh.

I could see the tension leave Tsugumi's body.


56 :

{C5A385}
[Sara]
Hey, what's this all about, onii-chan?


{C5A386}
[Sara]
Explain what's happening...

[Kid]
Alright.

[Kid]
"But before I do, I want to check 
something..."


57 :
I hesitated about what to say next.

I looked above my head.

The sky was full of stars.

The single whale twisted and floated through
space.

(Whale, where do you go all by yourself?)

(Will you meet someone special one day?)


‡LSnap.

I extinguished the lighter.

I gripped the pendant and the lighter in my
hand.

Tsugumi's outline was hazy in the dark...

She was...

Our...

Long sought-after...


58 :
[Kid]
Mom...

When I called out to her, warm tears ran down
my cheeks.

[Kid]
You are our mother... aren't you?

[Kid]
Our mother...

[Kid]
Mom...

[Kid]
You are, aren't you...?


59 :

{C5A387}
[Sara]
...What!?


60 :
Tsugumi slowly opened her eyes.


61 :
She looked at Sara and me.

I could see the tears in her eyes.


62 :
[Kid]
Mom, please say something...

[Kid]
I don't blame you... for anything...

[Kid]
I've waited for you... for so long...

[Kid]
I've been waiting for you...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Answer! Mom!

I screamed at her.

Sara clung to my arm.

Shaking her head, she buried her face in my
chest.

Her thin body was shaking.

[Kid]
Don't just stand there, say something!

Holding Sara tightly, I stepped forward.


63 :

{C5A388}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{C5A389}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not... your mother...

[Kid]
Don't you lie to me!

[Kid]
I know everything!

[Kid]
"Seventeen years ago, there was another 
accident just like this one here at LeMU."

[Kid]
You and Takeshi became a couple...


64 :
Tsugumi was shedding huge tears.

She tried to stop them.

Her breath was ragged and came out in hiccups.


Her face twisted as she struggled to keep
control of her emotions.

Tears welled in her eyes and rolled down her
cheeks.


{C5A390}
[Tsugumi]
Yes... That's right...


{C5A391}
[Tsugumi]
You're right...


{C5A392}
[Tsugumi]
I gave birth to you...


{C5A393}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{C5A394}
[Tsugumi]
I have no right... to be called 'mother'...


{C5A395}
[Tsugumi]
You have... a real mother... don't you?


{C5A396}
[Tsugumi]
Someone who took care of you...?


{C5A397}
[Tsugumi]
I... I... wasn't able to protect you both...


{C5A398}
[Tsugumi]
I couldn't take care of you...


{C5A399}
[Tsugumi]
I pretty much abandoned you...


{C5A400}
[Tsugumi]
I left you... and walked away...


{C5A401}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm terrible... and I don't expect you to be 
able to forgive me..."


{C5A402}
[Tsugumi]
That's why I...


{C5A403}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not your mother...


{C5A404}
[Tsugumi]
Please... don't call me 'mother'...


{C5A405}
[Tsugumi]
Please don't...

Tsugumi put her head in her hands and sobbed.

At that moment...


{C5A406}
[Sara]
Mama...


{C5A407}
[Sara]
...Mama...


{C5A408}
[Sara]
MAMA!


65 :
Sara tore herself away from me and flew into
Tsugumi's arms.

Following her lead, I clung to Tsugumi and
cried as well.

The first thing I noticed was her familiar
smell.

I breathed in her scent deeply.

Covered in tears, wallowing in the warmth, I
felt as if I had regained everything I had
ever lost.

The three of us held each other tightly,
relishing the touch of one another. Entwined,
our hearts became one.

We were no longer our individual selves, but
one collective identity.

There were no boundaries between us.

My whole being was filled with warmth...

Beside me, Sara's cheeks were wet with tears.


Tsugumi was soft, and her skin was sweet and
sticky...

I recalled the long-forgotten memories of my
mother's smell.

It wasn't exactly the same feeling as
nostalgia.

It was primitive, something instinctive... A
sweetness that had been wired directly into my
brain.


{C5A409}
[Sara]
Mama...

[Kid]
Mom...

As if in response, Tsugumi pulled us closer,
gripping us with a fierce determination.

She buried her face in Sara's and my hair,
drew us close, and stroked the backs of our
heads.


{C5A410}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sorry...


{C5A411}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

Tsugumi's voice was choked up.


{C5A412}
[Tsugumi]
I can't ask you... to forgive me...


{C5A413}
[Tsugumi]
I... I...


{C5A414}
[Tsugumi]
I never... once forgot about you...


{C5A415}
[Tsugumi]
All... this... time...


{C5A416}
[Tsugumi]
I've wanted to see you...


{C5A417}
[Tsugumi]
Find you... and apologize...


{C5A418}
[Sara]
It's alright...


{C5A419}
[Sara]
Mama...


{C5A420}
[Sara]
You don't need to apologize...


{C5A421}
[Sara]
I... It's enough just to... be with you...

As we held onto each other, we understood
everything.

Sara and I accepted everything, understood, and
forgave.

Reasons weren't important.

At that moment, a quiet peace filled us...


It was enough.

We didn't require anything else.

I relaxed and leaned against my mother.


She was warm.

I closed my eyes and was intoxicated by her
warmth.

[Kid]
Mom...

[Kid]
...Mom...


66 :
A cozy slumber...

A soft breeze under the May sunshine...

Peace...

It was like floating on the calm ocean...

Swaying comfortably...

Cuddled up together...

Before I knew it, I had stopped crying...

All I could hear was... just our calm breathing
and...

My mother's heartbeat...

Thump, thump... Thump, thump... Thump, thump...

I was alive.

Or maybe I had just been born.

Thump, thump... Thump, thump... Thump, thump...

Everything was affirmed, accepted, and
forgiven.

There was no me, nor Sara, nor Tsugumi...


There was only one life connected together...

Just one single soul.


67 :
‡LIn the year 2017, May 7th, 11 a.m.

The men from Leiblich were waiting for
Tsugumi when she got to the floating island.

Tsugumi, a carrier of the Curé virus...

To them, she was a valuable sample...

{16:4}

68 :
Their eyes glaring and mouths half-open, she
could see their dark, wet tongues.

It was almost possible for Tsugumi to smell
the reek of their excitement.

Like the smell of men lusting after flesh...

It was a fetid stench, greasy and rotten.


For it was Tsugumi's body that they were after.

{16:4}

69 :
What they wanted was nothing more than to
perform human experiments under the pretext
of 'making the ultimate human dream come true'.

By using Tsugumi's body, they were planning
to gain knowledge, fame, and fortune.

That was indeed their desire.

{16:4}

70 :
'We've been waiting for you.'‡LOne of them
took a deep bow.

Behind his veneer of politeness was an evil
that threatened to spill forth, making
Tsugumi sick to her stomach.

Some of the others in his entourage licked
their lips... swallowing their saliva like
dogs gone mad with the hunt.

{16:4}

71 :
That instant, Tsugumi kicked hard off the
ground, breaking into a run.

She ran across the wide surface of the huge
artificial island, desperately scaling the
high surrounding fence, and fled into the
nearby foliage.

{16:4}

72 :
Their cacophony of screams and angry cursing
faded behind her.

Tsugumi hid and waited until nightfall.


She held a single hamster to her chest...

{16:4}

73 :
‡LAt night.

A supply-carrying vessel slipped out of the
floating island's port.

{16:4}

74 :
Tsugumi had stowed away on the vessel, hiding
herself among the cargo. She was headed to the
mainland.

From that moment on, Tsugumi's life was
consumed with one thought‡L'how to escape from
them'.

Although she wasn't a criminal, she avoided
people, preferring to hide in the darkness,
all the while threatened by ominous feelings
of being hunted.

{16:4}

75 :
Nothing changed after she safely made it to
land.

Every few weeks, she moved from one town to
another, wandering in the darkness...

She slept under bridges, under back street
eaves, pipes pouring into the ocean, and even
in public restrooms.

It was an endless cycle of running. She never
had a second's peace.

{16:4}

76 :
She couldn't turn to the police.

She had no place to live, her identity was
uncertain, and her age and appearance didn't
match...

The police would only doubt her.

Information regarding Tsugumi had spread
through the national police network, so it was
only a matter of time before Leiblich would
find her.

{16:4}

77 :
Leiblich's influence even extended to national
politics.

There was nothing else for Tsugumi to do but
continue to hide in back alleys.

She hated Leiblich.

They had destroyed everything Tsugumi had
cared about and made her life a living
hell... What was more...

{16:4}

78 :
They had taken away the love of her
life... Kuranari Takeshi.

She wanted to get revenge on Leiblich with
every fiber of her being.

Tsugumi came to hate the world, and her heart
became even more hardened to it.

{16:4}

79 :
‡LTwo months had passed. It was summertime.

All of a sudden, she began feeling sick...

She knew she had stopped menstruating, but she
didn't want to think about the possibility.

{16:4}

80 :
She went to visit an illegal doctor who was
well-known in the back streets.

Tsugumi was pregnant.

She was sure it was Takeshi's baby. She'd
never been with anyone else.

She was pregnant...

{16:4}

81 :
At night, she went to the deserted coastal
area of a small, nearby town.

There were nothing but printing factories and
abandoned houses.

Unsure if it was a river or the ocean, she
sat on a boat dock, looking at a neon sign by
the highway.

She touched her stomach.

She felt a sense of awe and joy at the fact
there was life growing in her belly and
that it was connected to her.

{16:4}

82 :
The neon light glittered and flickered off of
the water's surface.

Tsugumi looked at the lights... with her hands
on her stomach...

Realizing that Takeshi's babies were inside
her, she couldn't stop crying.

They might have only been only a centimeter
big at that time...

{16:4}

83 :
But the survival of the two babies
outstripped the needs of the mother's body
that surrounded them...

Tsugumi almost had the illusion that it
wasn't her who bore the children, but it was
actually they who bore her.

Everything that she was, she poured into her
two babies.

{16:4}

84 :
She felt that she was part of the babies, not
the other way around.

It was then that Tsugumi decided to sacrifice
everything for the two tiny lives.

Love was a concept to her, but if love could
be brought into physical form, to her, it
seemed it must be the babies in her.

{16:4}

85 :
That was it, love was growing inside her.

Takeshi and Tsugumi's babies...

Before long, the hatred she had felt toward
everything had disappeared without a trace.

For the first time, Tsugumi felt as though
there were a higher power guiding her life.

{16:4}

86 :
‡LSeven months later. January 21st, 2018.

Tsugumi was suddenly struck with contractions.

When they came, the back-alley doctor had gone
somewhere.

{16:4}

87 :
She visited a nearby clinic.

She had no medical insurance, no
identification. Most importantly, she had no
money...

When he found out that she couldn't pay, the
doctor beat Tsugumi as though she were a
stray animal.

{16:4}

88 :
With nowhere else to go, the two babies were
born in an old boat shack.

An old woman was living there, but Tsugumi
couldn't tell whether she lived there or was
just a vagrant.

It was that old woman who helped Tsugumi
through the birth.

{16:4}

89 :
'Ooh how precious, so precious... You done a
fine job, deary.'

The old lady repeated that many times as she
gently rinsed the babies in a tin basin.

The sweat-covered Tsugumi was lying down,
with only a thin towel between her and a
hardwood floor.

Tsugumi's eyes gazed, unfocused, out a nearby
window.

{16:4}

90 :
Snow was falling outside.

'How darling... Yes, a precious boy and
girl... Which one'll ya hold first?'

The illegal doctor had told her, so she was
expecting twins, but she never imagined that
they would be fraternal.

{16:4}

91 :
A bit surprised, she said...

'Both at the same time...'

Wrapped in an old cloth, Tsugumi gently held
them to her chest.

'Not to worry, my deary. I boiled them cloth
and the scissors what cut their cord in hot
water good, I did.'

{16:4}

92 :
'Thank you.'

Tsugumi thanked her.

'Thank you... Thank you very much...'

She gave thanks for the two lives who had
been born safely.

'Thank you...'

And those last words were directed toward the
deep darkness beyond the window.

{16:4}

93 :
The snow was falling.

The two babies pressed to Tsugumi's chest
with their eyes closed let out small yawns.

{16:4}

94 :
‡LThe Curé virus.

Soon after she had given birth, Tsugumi's
thoughts were turned to the possibility.

'If they got infected by Curé while they were
inside of me...'

'And if their DNA was altered just like me...'


Tsugumi visited the illegal doctor.

{16:4}

95 :
'Don't worry about it.'‡LHe explained,
laughing...

According to taxonomic classification, a pure
human would belong to 'Primates Anthropoidea
Hominoidea Hominidae Homo Sapiens'.

Tsugumi, whose genetic information was altered by
the Curé virus, was not a pure human anymore,
but rather a subspecies of it.

{16:4}

96 :
'Let's just call you subspecies 'Curé' for
now...'

'Now, any kids who were born from 'Takeshi,
the Homo Sapiens' and 'Tsugumi, the Curé'
would technically be 'hybrids'.'

{16:4}

97 :
'Now, by the way, I guess I should tell you
that the Curé virus only infects pure humans,
the 'Homo Sapiens'.'

'So, there's no way the Curé virus could possibly
affect your two 'little hybrids' there.'

'While not much is known about the Curé virus,
some of the unique functions scientists have
discovered, such as 'regenerating telomeres'
and 'regenerative healing', are inherited
recessively.'

{16:4}

98 :
'For blood types, without exception, all
children born from a 'type AA father' and a
'type OO mother', for instance, can only be
'type AO,' with a 'type A' predisposition.'

'Why? Because type A factors are inherited
dominantly, and type O factors are inherited
recessively.'

'In order for a child's blood type to be
'type O'...'

{16:4}

99 :
'...You'd have to have a mixture of either
'AO x AO', 'AO x BO', 'AO x OO', 'BO x BO',
'BO x OO', or 'OO x OO'...'

'...It can only be one of the above, meaning
that BOTH the parents gotta add that type 'O'
factor to the genetic milkshake.'

'Same goes for the Curé virus.'

{16:4}

100 :
'Any child born from a pureblooded 'Sapiens'
and 'Curé' will...'

'...All be 'Sapiens-Curé' and inherit the
dominant physical traits of both.'


'For them rugrats to become full-blooded
'Curé'...'

{16:4}

101 :
'...The parents would have be 'Curé x Curé',
'Sapiens Curé x Curé', or 'Sapiens Curé x
Sapiens Curé'...'

'...Any of those combinations, meaning that
both parents have to be part or all Curé.'

{16:4}


102 :
'And since these two little critters were
born from a 'pure Sapiens' and 'pure Curé...'


'They'll have the same physical traits as a
pure human and won't possess the Curé traits
like perpetual youth.'

{16:4}

103 :
'So, you don't have nothing to worry about,
alright?' The doctor held up the two babies
Tsugumi had brought and laughed again.

Tsugumi didn't know his background.

It was probable that he had been part of
Leiblich's laboratory staff in the past
since he knew so much about the Curé virus.

But he didn't seem to be one of them. Tsugumi
figured she could trust him.

{16:4}

104 :
Among outcasts, there was an unspoken law: You
don't go nosing around in other people's pasts.

Tsugumi didn't ask him anything more, and he
didn't demand to know about her either.

{16:4}

105 :
‡LA year after giving birth.

It was winter again.

Tsugumi had rented a tiny room and lived
together with the two babies.

Of course, Chami was there as well.

It was a quiet, rustic coastal town.

It wasn't a city or tourist town, no fishing
or farming... Nothing... Just a dreary port town.

{16:4}

106 :
During the day, Tsugumi worked for next to
nothing at a sewing factory while the babies
stayed at a daycare center.

She spent every day glued to a sewing
machine from early morning to 4 p.m., and
after that, she would spend time with the
babies.

Her wages were very low, so of course they
were poor. She couldn't even afford
disposable diapers.

{16:4}

107 :
Tsugumi collected small scraps of cloth,
leftovers from the factory, and sewed diapers
and clothes for the babies.

Despite the harsh living conditions, the
babies were growing healthily.

Their life was a peaceful one, and although
they were poor, the poverty didn't threaten
them. They were content.

The three of them were always smiling.

{16:4}

108 :
'Momma... Momma...' 'Oh... Chammiii,
Chammiii...'

They were already beginning to talk.


The boy had started walking a few steps at a
time. The was girl able to stand, barely, as
she held onto things.

{16:4}

109 :
The girl had begun to speak, 'Oh... Chammiii,
Chammiii...', which was very unusual for a
one-year-old.

The boy, it seemed, grew faster physically,
and the girl grew faster intellectually.

Tsugumi tenderly watched over their cute
gestures. She was filled with happiness.

{16:4}

110 :
‡LMay 7th, 2019.

The two babies were fifteen months old.

Tsugumi had taken them to the beach.

{16:4}

111 :
The boy ran around the sand, falling and
getting back up over and over.


The girl was sitting by the water, putting her
hands in the waves...

She was giggling, saying, 'Cooold... So cold...'

{16:4}


112 :
Watching out over the flat surface of the
ocean, Tsugumi's thoughts turned to Takeshi.

'So live! As long as you're alive, live! Don't
worry... I'm not going to die.'‡Lthose were
Takeshi's last words to her.

It had been two years already.

'I'm not going to die.'‡LAfter saying that,
he sank to the bottom of the ocean,
protecting the woman he loved, protecting the
children right in front of her.

{16:4}

113 :
'You fool, you're a liar.'‡LTsugumi whispered
to the ocean.

But at the same time, she still hadn't given
up hope.

'No... He must be alive somewhere. He's a man
of his word.'


‡LJust then.

{16:4}

114 :
A wave swallowed the girl, who had been
playing near the edge of the water.

It was a small, sun-soaked wave from an adult's
perspective, but for a one-year-old child it was a
raging wall of water.

The girl disappeared in a splash of water and
was sucked out into the ocean like a piece of
driftwood by the tide.

{16:4}

115 :
Tsugumi ran as hard as she could, held back
by the resistance of the sand.

But before she could get there, something
unbelievable happened.

The boy, who was only one year and three
months old, jumped into the water and saved
the girl.

Hardly able to believe what she had seen,
Tsugumi rushed toward them.

{16:4}

116 :
She carried them to dry sand.

The girl started crying.

The boy, seemingly unaware of what had
happened, looked at his crying sister.

{16:4}

117 :
A few seconds later... he fell over as if all his
strength had left him.

That night, both of them came down with a
high fever.

{16:4}

118 :
‡LIt was summertime. A year and a half had
passed since the birth.

All of that time in the previous year and a half
had been filled with happiness.

Nothing special had happened... and that was
why it had been so peaceful...

{16:4}

119 :
The boy was a wild one, and Tsugumi could
hardly take her eyes off of him for a second.

He was constantly putting everything (even
Chami) in his mouth...

Any electrical appliance that he touched seemed
to break, and he wouldn't stop jamming metal
wires into the outlets.

{16:4}

120 :
The girl wasn't quite as much of a challenge,
since she moved about less, but still Tsugumi
had to put up with her stubbornness.

She refused to eat things she didn't like,
and when she got in a bad mood, she wouldn't
stop fussing...

And no matter how much Tsugumi warned her, she
wouldn't stop playing with her brother's hair.

And she would always demand, 'More Chami!
More Chami!'

{16:4}

121 :
Those days were filled with Tsugumi being
buffeted about by her two rambunctious
children...

But no matter how challenging they were, even
those days were filled with happiness.

{16:4}

122 :
At night, all three of them slept together,
cuddled up on a thin mattress.

'Momma... Momma...'

'Aaah... Chammiii, Chammmiii...'

Talking in their sleep, the two babies sought
their mother's touch.

Looking down at their sweet, innocent gestures,
Tsugumi felt bliss she had never known.

{16:4}

123 :
‡LOne day.

Her peaceful world was shattered to pieces.

{16:4}

124 :
It all happened so unexpectedly...

Caught up in her life of happiness, Tsugumi
had forgotten to watch out for 'them'.

She didn't know how they had found out, but
they had somehow gathered information and
showed up without warning.

Them... The people from Leiblich...

{16:4}

125 :
With no time to collect anything, all
Tsugumi could bring with her was her two
babies and her hamster as she fled.

So they ran, but...

It was obvious to Tsugumi that, eventually,
Leiblich would hunt them down.

As they continued running, Tsugumi thought to
herself.

{16:4}

126 :
'Even if I could keep escaping, would it
really be happiness for the two children?'

'They wouldn't be able to go to school.'


'And it would be too hard on them to keep
moving from town to town.'

'Besides... if we ever get caught, what would
they do to my children at Leiblich?'

{16:4}

127 :
'It's too dangerous for them to be with me...'

Tsugumi made up her mind.

{16:4}

128 :
She researched an orphanage she could trust
and decided to leave them there.

The two children were just too young...

Even if Tsugumi had tried to explain, they
couldn't have understood.

With no other option, she left the pendant
she had kept with her, making a wish as she
gave it.

{16:4}

129 :
'I will come back for you. I will come to get
you, I promise.'

Being too young to understand the situation,
the two children just stared at their mother,
crying.

Weeping bitter tears, Tsugumi looked back many
times as she walked away.

{16:4}

130 :
All she had left was Chami.

From Tsugumi's chest pocket, Chami looked up
at her face in puzzlement.

But even Chami's cute gestures could do
little to ease Tsugumi's broken heart.

She spent many nights in the depths of despair,
crying in her sorrow.

{16:4}

131 :
‡LA few years later.

By the time Tsugumi went back to the
orphanage, the children were already gone.

From that time on, she had gone through life...

No more than an empty husk...

Until that day, until that very moment...

Tsugumi had kept searching for her children...

Wandering through darkness.

{16:4}

132 :
Tsugumi finished telling her story and closed
her eyes gently.

She never once mentioned the names 'Hokuto'
or 'Sara' in the story.

Because those names weren't the names Tsugumi
had given them.

Someone else had named them 'Hokuto' and
'Sara'.


133 :
.........

......

...


134 :
I left Tsugumi and Sara.

If I could, I wanted to stay with them
forever, but it wasn't possible.

There were still many unsolved matters that I
needed to take care of.

Listening to Tsugumi's story had caused me to
suddenly remember something.

I had received a phone call before coming to
LeMU.

Over the phone, a voice had said to me...

'If you come to LeMU, you can see your mother
and sister.'

[Kid]
Oh, so that was it...

[Kid]
"Before the accident took place, I had been 
waiting for someone at the rest area."

[Kid]
It must have been my mother and Sara...

Tsugumi must have been roped into coming to
LeMU in the same way I was.

‡LWait, roped in!?

‡LWhat for...!?

I still didn't know the answer to that.

But I had some clues...

The voice on the phone had been male.

Without a doubt, I knew whose voice it had been.


I ran to him.


135 :
[Kid]
You... You...

[Kid]
You aren't Kuranari Takeshi!

Barging into the rest area, I demanded an
answer from the man in front of me.

I couldn't call him 'Takeshi' anymore.

That guy had been deceiving us the whole time.


136 :

{C5A422}
[Takeshi]
"Look, I don't have any clue what you're 
talking about..."

[Kid]
Don't play dumb!

[Kid]
"I know that the real Takeshi is Sara's and my 
father!"


137 :

{C5A423}
[Takeshi]
Father? Me? You and Sara's?

[Kid]
No, not you!

[Kid]
"Sara and I are the children of Takeshi and 
Tsugumi."


138 :

{C5A424}
[Takeshi]
Wait, so Tsugumi and I...

[Kid]
I keep telling you, you're not Takeshi!

[Kid]
"I'm talking about Takeshi from the other 
world!"


{C5A425}
[Takeshi]
"Other world? What the heck's that supposed 
to mean?"

[Kid]
The world back in 2017!


139 :

{C5A426}
[Takeshi]
Um... 2017, huh...?


{C5A427}
[Takeshi]
And when were you born?

[Kid]
On January 21st, sixteen years ago.


{C5A428}
[Takeshi]
In what year?

[Kid]
In 2018!


{C5A429}
[Takeshi]
I see.


{C5A430}
[Takeshi]
"So how could you possibly know what 
happened in 2017?"

[Kid]
"I dunno, I just do! What do you expect me to 
do about it!?"

[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
Besides, we're not talking about me now.

[Kid]
Who... Who are you anyway!?

[Kid]
And why did you lie about the year 2017!?

[Kid]
"Why are you pretending to be Kuranari 
Takeshi!?"

[Kid]
"What was the reason you tried to trick us by 
repeating the same incident as seventeen years ago 
and by using the same words!?"


140 :

{C5A431}
[Takeshi]
To trick you... To trick you, huh...?


141 :

{C5A432}
[Takeshi]
Think twice, will you, Kid?


{C5A433}
[Takeshi]
"For instance, if I was repeating the 
incident in 2017..."


{C5A434}
[Takeshi]
"How could I possibly trick you, someone who 
was born in 2018?"


{C5A435}
[Takeshi]
"Practically speaking, it's impossible to 
trick you into believing the same incident 
from seventeen years ago is taking place."


{C5A436}
[Takeshi]
Do you get it?

[Kid]
.........


142 :

{C5A437}
[Takeshi]
"Besides, how could you tell it was the same 
incident?"


{C5A438}
[Takeshi]
"How could you tell that I'm using the same 
phrase?"


{C5A439}
[Takeshi]
"How could you know the history before you 
were even born!?"


143 :

{C5A440}
[Takeshi]
Why don't you reveal your true self?


{C5A441}
[Takeshi]
Who are you anyway!?

For some reason, I couldn't say a word.

(Who am I anyway...?)

The same question was repeated in my mind.


144 :

{C5A442}
[Takeshi]
"Oh, I see, when it comes to your story, you 
clam up, huh...?"


{C5A443}
[Takeshi]
Alright then.


145 :

{C5A444}
[Takeshi]
I'll tell you my real name.


{C5A445}
[Takeshi]
Yes, as you said, I am not Kuranari Takeshi.


{C5A446}
[Takeshi]
My real name is...


{C5A447}
[Kaburaki]
Kaburaki.


{C5A448}
[Kaburaki]
Kaburaki Ryogo.


146 :

{C5A449}
[Kaburaki]
Kaburaki Ryogo.


{C5A450}
[Kaburaki]
I just remembered my name...

The Kid repeated it slowly.


147 :

{C5A451}
[Kaburaki]
Ka-bu-ra-ki... Ryo-go...


148 :
[Takeshi]
Kaburaki Ryogo...

[Takeshi]
I see...

[Takeshi]
Way to go.

I smiled and patted his head.

The young Kaburaki smiled shyly...


149 :
Without a word, the young Kaburaki went
behind the statue and started scratching.

He had a screwdriver in his hand...

'Kaburaki Ryogo'.

With thin, sharp writing, the young Kaburaki
carved his name deeply into the statue.

He must have been pretty happy to have
remembered his name.

Or was it so that he wouldn't forget it
again...?

Although I didn't know the reason, he carved
his name into the statue.

He continued on...

Without stopping his hands, he also carved some
more names...

'Yagami £o¢o'

'Tanaka Yubiseiharukana'

'Komachi Tsugumi'

'Akanegasaki Sora'

'Kuranari Takeshi'

'Pipi' and 'Chami'


150 :
The young Kaburaki carved the names of everyone
who had been confined there.

He smiled happily after finishing up...


The statue kept silent with its hand on the
chest...


151 :
That boy's name was also... Kaburaki Ryogo!?

Which meant that... the Kid from seventeen
years ago and... the guy pretending to be
Takeshi were... actually the same person!?

He looked so young that it was hard to
believe it had been seventeen years.

If the young Kaburaki was 15 years old, that
would make him 32 years old in my world.

But the Kaburaki I spoke to looked around
20... There was no way he could have been
over 30 years old.

Which meant...?

.........

Before I realized it, the man who called
himself Kaburaki had disappeared.

He had left a while before.

I'd been standing there lost in thought for
some time.

I recalled the scene in 2017 which
I had just witnessed earlier...


152 :
I went around one of the statues as if being
called over to it.


153 :
On its back were carved childish stick figures.


Six human-like figures and two unfamiliar
animal shapes were drawn there.

[Kid]
...What?

I looked at the statue.

The statue pointed south.

[Kid]
?


154 :
I looked at the back of the other statues as well.


155 :
Surprisingly, there were similar drawings on
the statue pointing to the sky.


156 :
There were also six people's names as
well as 'Pipi' and 'Chami' carved into the
statue which stood with its hand on its chest.


157 :
There was no writing on the statue pointing
east.

[Kid]
Oh, just what is this supposed to mean!?

[Kid]
What's up with this world anyway!?


158 :
Puzzled and confused, my head felt like it
was about to explode.

I didn't know things that I was supposed to
know... I knew things that I wasn't supposed
to...

(That must be why my head is so confused.)


(I still haven't recalled any of my memories.)

Some parts of it had come back, but nothing
really important.

To begin with, I still didn't know what kind
of person 'Hokuto' was.

And at the same time, I knew what I wasn't
supposed to know and I could see what I
wasn't supposed to see.

For instance, the world seventeen years into the
past...

About the legend of Pygmalion, the Tief Blau
virus, the Curé virus, Pipi, and Chami...

I knew about all of them.

I knew exactly what had happened during the
dramatic escape seventeen years ago and what had
happened on May 6th and 7th.

And the world in 2034...

I could sense even the different history
flows in my world.

I knew about escaping using the principle of a
siphon and about swimming to the ocean
surface from 34 meters under the water.

The third eye... Blick Winkel... Those words
were clear in my head.

And... then...

I remembered running into Doctor Tanaka on the
floating island.

No, rather than remembering, it was better to
say that I could see it.

Anyway, I saw her.

The woman who was called Doctor Tanaka...
Yubiseiakikana's mother...

Meaning she was actually Yubiseiharukana.


Although their relationship defied the norm,
Yubiseiharukana and Yubiseiakikana were
still mother and daughter.

.........

Pieces of my thoughts scattered...

I tried gathering them and struggled to come
up with some kind of conclusion.

[Kid]
It's 2034 now...

[Kid]
And £o¢o was in 2017...

I whispered to confirm the facts.

Yes, that was right, it was 2034...

That was why Tsugumi had been so suspicious
of us.

Because the same thing that had happened
seventeen years ago was repeating...

How about the others?

Since Yubiseiakikana had been born seventeen
years prior, she couldn't possibly have known about
the incident.

And since Sara hadn't been born yet, she
wouldn't know either.

Sora, being AI, couldn't lie. And she didn't
seem to be lying either.

So that only left Kaburaki...

Did that mean Kaburaki was the mastermind
behind the whole incident in 2034?

No, wait...

There had been two others who had survived the
incident seventeen years ago...

Yubiseiharukana and £o¢o.

On May 6th, 2017...

Kaburaki, Yubiseiharukana, and £o¢o, who had
been infected with the Tief Blau virus, had
been rescued by the minisub which came to
the pool in IBF.

[Kid]
Hey, that reminds me...

How did the three of them recover from the
virus after they'd been infected?

Because of the injection of antibodies made
from Tsugumi's blood...?

But £o¢o hadn't received the antibodies.

Because she had been under high-pressure
oxygen treatment in the capsule pod at the
time...

[Kid]
...Huh?

No, no, even before that.

Yubiseiharukana suffered from 'critical
heart disease', right?

But she was still alive and well.


[Kid]
What is going on here...?

There was only one answer...

It was the only explanation...

Yubiseiharukana and Kaburaki must have been
infected with the Curé virus.

Their bodies must have repeated five years
worth of cell division, and when all their
DNA had been rewritten, they stopped aging.

That must have been why they looked younger
than their real age.

And Yubiseiharukana's heart disease would
have been fixed by the Curé virus.

[Kid]
But still...

[Kid]
Is that really what happened...?

In a different history flow, Kaburaki
couldn't see the image in the pendant.

If he wasn't lying or acting, he must not have
possessed infrared vision.

And although I didn't have proof, my instincts
told me Yubiseiharukana didn't possess
infrared vision either.

Then again, in the world of 2017...

Tsugumi had mentioned she was 'special' among
carriers of the Curé virus.


Perhaps she was a rare example of DNA
replacement that had taken place safely over
the whole body.

That meant...?

Yubiseiharukana and Kaburaki weren't
complete Curé?

But... it didn't seem to me that there could
be any such thing as an 'incomplete Curé'...

[Kid]
Um...

[Kid]
It's no use...

[Kid]
I can't figure it out...

But I still had a far more serious and pressing
matter to deal with.


I needed to think about that problem first.

The problem was...

'How was I able to sense incidents that had
taken place before I was born, or in separate
time continua?'

And...

'Why is the same accident as seventeen years
earlier taking place again?'

It couldn't have been a coincidence.

Obviously, someone had planned it.


There was only one clue...

£o¢o.

I wanted to see £o¢o.

I felt that £o¢o would know everything there
was to know about the incident.

But how could I find £o¢o, who seemed to just
pop up randomly?

[Kid]
Oh, I know...

I had a sudden inspiration...

I had a hunch.

At that hour on the 5th...

£o¢o would show up...

In the Cosmic Whale room...
