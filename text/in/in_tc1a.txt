{C1T000}
[Girl]
"It doesn't do us any good just standing 
around here. Can you show us the way?"


{C1T001}
[Park staff]
"Certainly. There is a relatively safe place 
nearby. I will take you there..."

(RELATIVELY safe...?)

That was about the same as saying that
everywhere else was dangerous.


2 :
We turned around and started heading back the
corridor we'd been washed down.

I looked at a panel and finally realized that
we were in Zweiter Stock‡Lbasement level two.

A short time later...

After walking a few dozen meters, a strange
sound caught my attention.


3 :
Bam, bam, bam, bam...

4 :
{11:0-71}
{11:1}It's just my imagination

{11:1}Did you just hear something?


5 :
(That sounded like a pounding noise...?)

[Takeshi]
Hey, did you just hear something?


6 :

{C1T005}
[Park staff]
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?


{C1T006}
[Park staff]
"Due to all of the water pressure here at 
LeMU, it isn't uncommon for the metal 
partitions to rattle occasionally."


7 :
Yeah. It must have just been my imagination.

Maybe it was just like she said, and LeMU's
partitions were only creaking.

Shaking it off, we kept trudging forward.


8 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, did you just hear something?

I stopped and asked the two of them.


9 :

{C1T002}
[Girl]
?


{C1T003}
[Park staff]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
"You didn't just hear a kind of pounding 
noise?"


{C1T004}
[Girl]
No.


10 :

{C1T005}
[Park staff]
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?


{C1T006}
[Park staff]
"Due to all of the water pressure here at 
LeMU, it isn't uncommon for the metal 
partitions to rattle occasionally."

[Takeshi]
Nah, it didn't sound like that.

[Takeshi]
"It sounded like someone pounding on something 
with their hand."


{C1T007}
[Girl]
?


{C1T008}
[Park staff]
?

[Takeshi]
I'm going to go check.


11 :

{C1T009}
[Park staff]
Alright, we'll go with you.

The girl didn't say anything. She just
silently tagged along with us.


12 :
‡LIn front of the Jellyfish Gondola.


13 :
Bam, bam, bam... Bam, bam, bam...


14 :
[Takeshi]
There. You can hear it, right?


15 :

{C1T010}
[Park staff]
Yeah...


{C1T011}
[Girl]
So there's someone else trapped here too...?

We strained our ears to find where the sound
was coming from.

It seemed to come from the elevator area right
behind us.


16 :
The three of us (myself and the two girls)
ran over to that area as fast as we could.



17 :

{C1T012}
[???]
Heeeeey! Somebooooody!


{C1T013}
[???]
Somebooooody!


{C1T014}
[???]
Is anyone theeere?


{C1T015}
[???]
Anyooooone?

Two female voices were coming from inside the
elevator.


18 :
The three of us looked at each other and
nodded.


19 :
[Takeshi]
Hey! Can you hear us!?


{C1T016}
[???]
Ah! Y-y-yeah! I can hear you!

[Takeshi]
Hang on! We'll get you out!


{C1T017}
[???]
Please!


{C1T018}
[???]
Aah... Thank goodness...


{C1T019}
[???]
I didn't think anyone would come to help...

The voice from inside sounded well.


It didn't sound weak or injured.


I placed both of my hands firmly on the door
and pried it apart with all my strength.


20 :
The door opened.


21 :
On the other side of the door, there
was... nothing.

The lift (or at least the part people ride in)
hadn't stopped directly on the floor.

I looked down at my feet.

I spotted a circular floor slightly below in
the darkness.

No. I realized that wasn't the floor; it was
the roof of the trapped elevator.

It was a little more than two meters from where
I was standing

Next, I...

22 :
{11:0-73}
{11:1}I stepped forward

{11:1}I looked up


23 :
I stepped forward.

And fell...

I should have known.


24 :
I looked up.

Thick pipes extended vertically with what
looked like four rails attached to their sides.

It seemed that the elevator used those rails
to move up and down.

Come to think of it, I didn't see any trace of
cables or wires that you might expect in an
elevator.

Which meant that the elevator wasn't using
pulleys to go up and down...

Craning my head to get a better look, I gazed
farther up the shaft to see where the pipe
went.

There wasn't any lighting, but enough light
poured through from behind me that I could
get a vague sense of the outline.

The pipes ended partway up, as did the rails.


Where they ended, they were covered by some
kind of heavy partition.

(Partition...?)

(Maybe it's a watertight door...?)

A section of the pipe had been closed off,
probably to prevent seawater from flooding in.

I didn't notice anything else.

Not even a ladder attached to the wall.

Meaning...

(The only way down is to jump...)

I leaped out into the void.


25 :
Landing impressively...

...At least that was my INTENTION...


26 :
‡LWHAM!

[Takeshi]
Agh!

I struck my knee painfully.


{C1T020}
[???]
Are you alriiight?

I heard a voice from below.


{C1T021}
[Park staff]
Did you hurt yourself?

And then a voice from above...

Looking up from the other side of the square
frame of the elevator doors, the female park
employee had a worried expression on her face.

[Takeshi]
Yeah, sure, I'm fine, just fine...

I replied while rubbing my knee.

It had been a long time since I'd jumped down
from a height greater than my own.

Maybe not since elementary school.

And as I stood there thinking that...

[Takeshi]
Hold on. I'll get you out of there.


{C1T022}
[???]
Okaaaay.

I opened up the small door set into the
ceiling of the elevator.


27 :

{C1T023}
[???]
Oh, thank you so much!

I looked to the girl inside

Her face was one big smile. She was clearly
happy she was about to be freed.

(Huh?)

(I think I've seen this girl... somewhere
before...)

[Takeshi]
Ah!


{C1T024}
[???]
Ah!

[Takeshi]
You're that girl from before!


{C1T025}
[???]
You're that guy from before!

The girl and I pointed at each other and froze.


{PIPI_01}
[???]
*Woof*!

I spotted the scruffy face of a dog circling
around her feet.

[Takeshi]
Popo...


{C1T026}
[???]
His name's not 'Popo'...


{C1T027}
[£o¢o]
"This little guy's name is Pipi, and my name's 
£o¢o... Try not to mix them up, okay?"

Pipi and £o¢o...

That was right...

It was the dog that had clamped onto that
mascot Myumyun's tail, up at the floating
island, and his owner.

[Takeshi]
But... what are you doing here?


{C1T028}
[£o¢o]
I don't really know what to say...


{C1T029}
[£o¢o]
"I was trying to go to one of the lower 
levels, and all of a sudden this escalator 
stopped, and..."

[Takeshi]
"It isn't an escalator, it's an elevator, 
alright?"


{C1T030}
[£o¢o]
Haha, oops... I mean evelator, okay?

[Takeshi]
No, NOT e-ve-lator, E-LE-VA-TOR.

[Takeshi]
"If you're on a moving staircase, that's 
called an escalator, and if you're in a box 
that goes up and down, that's an 
elevator... Try not to mix them up."

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{C1T031}
[£o¢o]
Does it really matter?


{C1T032}
[£o¢o]
"Anyway, I don't know why, but all of a 
sudden I was trapped in this box."

[Takeshi]
Really...

It had been the same with me.

It had only been a little earlier that I had
been trapped in another elevator...


{C1T033}
[£o¢o]
Hey?

[Takeshi]
Hmmm?


{C1T034}
[£o¢o]
I'd kind of like to get out of here... soon...

£o¢o gave me an imploring look.

[Takeshi]
Oh, aah, I'm sorry.

I said that and got down on my stomach from
atop the elevator.

I leaned down from the small hole and stuck
my hand out to £o¢o.


{C1T035}
[£o¢o]
Please, help Pipi first.

£o¢o held Pipi up to me, stretching as far as
she could to make him reach.

I grabbed onto Pipi's front legs and pulled
him out from the hole in the ceiling.


{PIPI_08}
[Pipi]
*Whine*... *whine*...

Pipi sniffed for my scent.

[Takeshi]
Okay, it's your turn next, £o¢o.

I stuck out my hand again.


28 :

{C1T036}
[£o¢o]
Aia! Wah! Ayah!

£o¢o jumped over and over, reaching out for my
hand.

But... either she was too short or just
couldn't jump, because she didn't even
reach my fingertips.

[Takeshi]
Hey, that reminds me...

From the position I was in, arms hanging down,
I looked around the elevator.

I realized that nobody was in there but £o¢o.
There was no mistake.

(Huh? That's strange...)

(I could have sworn I heard two people in
there...)


29 :

{C1T037}
[£o¢o]
"Aaii! Haiya! Awwww, just a little bit 
farther..."

£o¢o was still jumping.

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o?


{C1T038}
[£o¢o]
Yeah?

[Takeshi]
Pipi can't speak, uh, Japanese, right?


{C1T039}
[£o¢o]
Of course not!


{C1T040}
[£o¢o]
He only speaks Piplish!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!

Pipi barked into my ear.

[Takeshi]
That's what I thought...


{C1T041}
[£o¢o]
...What's wrong?

[Takeshi]
"Uh, well, earlier? I could have sworn I heard 
two voices coming from this elevator..."


{C1T042}
[£o¢o]
Two?


{C1T043}
[£o¢o]
"This whole time, it's only been Pipi and me in 
here."

[Takeshi]
Uhhh... Yeah, I can tell that from looking.

[Takeshi]
Maybe the next elevator over?

£o¢o looked puzzled.

[Takeshi]
Oh well. Whatever.

[Takeshi]
"Anyway, before I take care of that, we gotta 
get you out of here."

£o¢o started jumping again.


30 :

{C1T044}
[£o¢o]
Toriiyaa!


31 :

{C1T045}
[£o¢o]
Uuuriya!


32 :

{C1T046}
[£o¢o]
Eeeiii!


33 :

{C1T047}
[£o¢o]
Yaah!


34 :

{C1T048}
[£o¢o]
Waachooo!

.........

......

...


35 :

{C1T049}
[£o¢o]
Wheeew! That was close.


{C1T050}
[£o¢o]
Thank you so much.

£o¢o shook my hand profusely.


{C1T051}
[£o¢o]
Um, by the way, who are these people...?

£o¢o looked back and forth between the faces
of the female park employee and the girl in
black clothing.


36 :

{C1T052}
[Sora]
My name is Akanegasaki Sora.


{C1T053}
[Sora]
Do you remember me?


37 :

{C1T054}
[£o¢o]
"Aaah! You're that lady who was giving 
explanations at the entrance!"


{C1T055}
[Sora]
Yes.


38 :

{C1T056}
[£o¢o]
Ummm, uuuuhhh, my name is...


{C1T057}
[Sora]
I know.


39 :

{C1T058}
[Sora]
Yagami £o¢o-san, correct?


40 :

{C1T059}
[£o¢o]
Huh? How'd you know?


{C1T060}
[Sora]
"Because you were so enthusiastic when you 
replied to me, 'I'm Ya-ga-mi £o-¢o!'"


41 :

{C1T061}
[£o¢o]
Oh yeah...


{C1T062}
[£o¢o]
You remembered?


{C1T063}
[Sora]
I have a good memory.


{C1T064}
[Sora]
"I also remember your dog's name. Pipi, wasn't 
it?"


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!


42 :

{C1T065}
[£o¢o]
And... you are...?

£o¢o turned to the girl in black clothing.


43 :
[Girl]
.........


44 :

{PIPI_11}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*! *Woof*!

Shaking his tail excitedly, Pipi latched onto
the girl's skirt for some reason.


45 :

{C1T067}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


{C1T068}
[£o¢o]
"Um, wait a second... You wouldn't happen to 
be that person who was wearing the lemur 
costume?"

[Girl]
.........


{C1T069}
[£o¢o]
Hey, you are, aren't you?


46 :

{C1T070}
[£o¢o]
I know it! You've got to be!


{C1T071}
[£o¢o]
I remember your voice!


47 :

{C1T072}
[Girl]
"I don't really care about that... but 
can you do something about this mutt?"

The girl dropped her cutting gaze to Pipi, who
was busily gnawing on the edge of her skirt.


48 :

{C1T073}
[£o¢o]
Ah, aah, I'm sorry.

£o¢o scooped up Pipi and rapped him lightly
on the head.


49 :

{C1T074}
[£o¢o]
Don't you know better than that?


{PIPI_07}
[Pipi]
*Whine*, *whimper*...


50 :
[Takeshi]
"Hey? How about my name? You don't want to 
know?"

I asked as I twirled Pipi's tail around my
finger.


51 :

{C1T075}
[£o¢o]
I already know what it is.


{C1T076}
[£o¢o]
'Kuranari Takeshi'... right?

£o¢o said that with a grin on her face.

(Huh? When did I introduce myself?)


It bugged me that she knew, but...

...Oh well.

It wasn't really a big deal...


52 :

{C1T077}
[£o¢o]
"By the way... I've got something I want to 
ask..."


{C1T078}
[Sora]
?


{C1T079}
[Girl]
?

[Takeshi]
?


{C1T080}
[£o¢o]
Where did everyone else go?


53 :
While we were walking, Sora gave £o¢o a brief
explanation of the chain of events leading up
to that point.

The power failure. The alarms going off.

How we all failed to get out in time.

And of course, the flooding. Everything.


{C1T081}
[£o¢o]
F-flooooding!?


{C1T082}
[£o¢o]
"You mean water from the ocean came gushing 
into LeMU!?"

Taken off guard, £o¢o looked as if she'd been
gut-punched.

But it wasn't surprising.

Not many people would calmly reply, 'Oh,
really' when notified that they had just missed
a massive flood.

Actually, the fact that our group was able to
act as calmly as it did seemed fairly unusual.

Humans might have been surprisingly resilient
animals.

When one's life was on the line, people who
had the ability to keep levelheaded and think
the situation through to the next step...

From time immemorial, only people with those
traits survived to see their children and
children's children.

It occurred to me then.

And at the same time, for some reason, my chest
was pounding as I looked at the three girls.

(I'm the only guy here. The rest are girls.)


(So I can't mess things up. I've got to keep
it together no matter what.)

(As the only man here, it's my responsibility
to protect the three of them.)

It was a simple, old-fashioned, and maybe
moldy and petrified way of thinking. But at that
moment, it was simply how I felt.

Men protect women‡L

I was able to stay rational precisely because
that sense of righteousness drove my actions
to an almost embarrassing degree.


54 :
While I was thinking about those trivial
things, we'd changed location completely.

‡LThe dolphin merry-go-round.

Suddenly...


55 :

{C1T083}
[Sora]
Ah!

Sora raised her voice in alarm.

[Takeshi]
What is it?


56 :

{C1T084}
[Sora]
Someone's coming this way.

[Takeshi]
...What?


57 :

{T1B005}
[Park staff]
*Sigh*...


{T1B006}
[Park staff]
"For a while, I wondered what 
was going to happen to us, but..."

It was one of the female employees that I'd
met once before.


58 :

{T1B007}
[Park staff]
I'm glad we survived...


59 :

{T1B008}
[Park staff]
Hey, aren't you...?

The girl finally noticed us.

[Takeshi]
"I didn't think there'd be anybody 
else here."


60 :

{T1B009}
[Park staff]
Yeah. How are you?

[Takeshi]
About as good as I look, I suppose.


{T1B010}
[Park staff]
"Seems like you had a rough 
time of it too..."

[Takeshi]
Hey, lucky guess...

Relaxing a bit, I returned her smile.


61 :
Behind her was someone else.


62 :

{T1B013}
[Kid]
.........

The other person was the kid I brought to the
infirmary.

His expression looked darker somehow.

If he'd become super upbeat all of a
sudden, that would have been weird too, but...

For some reason, it bothered me.

[Takeshi]
"Is something wrong with him? He doesn't look 
so hot."


63 :

{T1B014}
[Park staff]
Oh, he's... a bit...

The attendant hesitated.


64 :

{T1B015}
[Park staff]
By the way...


{T1B016}
[Park staff]
"Hey, Sora, do you have any idea what our 
situation is?"

The girl asked Sora.


65 :

{T1B017}
[Sora]
"Well, the communication lines are down... 
I've been investigating ways to restore our 
connection, but it's going to take some time."
