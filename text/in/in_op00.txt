1 :
He was in the middle of a blue world.


2 :
As far as the eye could see, a sheet of water
reached into the distance.

The May sun shimmered on its surface.

Above, high above, stretched a clear blue sky.


The fresh new sky looked so glossy and vivid
that it might spill down to Earth at any
moment.

That was all that was reflected in his eyes.

The straight line of the horizon stretched
into the distance, dividing the sea from the
heavens.


3 :

{EOP000}
[Takeshi]
So tranquil...

He murmured to himself.

A solitary seagull traced a gentle arc in the
sky as the wind carried it away.

The wind, carrying the ocean's scent, blew
by him gently.

The din of people could be heard in the
background.

The merry sound of children's voices echoed
brighter than the sunlight pouring down.


{EOP001}
[Takeshi]
So peaceful...

It was as if it was in a dream.


4 :
‡L16 km from M Island, Komagahara
Archipelago, Tokyo.

The man-made island, Insel Null, rose above the
waves of the water. It seemed like a place
removed from reality.

The word 'utopia' might have sprung to mind to
describe it.

Actually, on a slab of rock on the boat dock of
the floating island were carved the words:



5 :
'Where is heaven?'

'Above the sky, and at your feet...'


6 :
Leaning out over the railing of the island, he
gazed into the ocean depths.

In the blue distance, he saw a massive metallic
structure swaying gently.


{EOP002}
[Takeshi]
Utopia, huh...?

He mumbled and looked back casually...


7 :
And there was a tanuki, or raccoon dog.

His eyes met those of the animal's.

For a moment, they eyed each other in silence.


{EOP003}
[Takeshi]
Uh... He-hello...

To clear the air, he nodded his head.


The animal turned away, ignoring him.


8 :
Upon closer inspection, he noticed something
biting the animal from behind.


9 :

{EOP004}
[???]
Grr... Grr... Grr...

It was a young girl.

She was shaped like a 'person'.


Looking closer revealed that there was
something strange about her as well.


10 :

{PIPI_24}
[???]
Grr... Grr... Grr...

Namely, a small tanuki attached to the girl's
backside.

'In front of him, there was a big tanuki being
bitten by a girl who was being bitten by a
smaller tanuki.'

The scene was enough to make him lose his
sense of reality.

He rubbed his eyes, rubbed them some more,
and opened them again...

Even after blinking several times... the
bizarre scene refused to go away.


{EOP005}
[Tanuki]
Hey.


{EOP006}
[Tanuki]
Would you do something about this kid?

Whispered the big tanuki.

But the words didn't reach his mind because
it was so busy trying to process the absurd
scene.


{PIPI_24}
[???]
Grr... Grr... Grr...


{EOP007}
[???]
Grr... Grr... Grr...

(I must be dreaming, right?)

‡LThat was what he was really thinking.


11 :
A dream‡L

A dream that would not let him wake up.

And whiteness.

A cold, white reality stretching forever.

He felt the difference in temperature on his
skin...

The shock of it finally forced him to open his
eyes.


12 :
[Kid]
...

He wondered how long he had been sitting.

It couldn't have been long.

He had only been in the park an hour.

He'd been sitting on the bench the whole time.

Eating the same ice cream.


{EOP008}
[Kid]
It's cold.

Of course it was.

It had melted into a muddy mess.

The melted vanilla ice cream trickled onto his
hand, spilling on his lap.


{EOP009}
[Kid]
Wooh, that's cold.

The ice cream slowly soaked into the fabric of
his pants.

Finally, the coldness of it had spread
completely, soaking into his skin.

He had been sitting there a while.

He had been sitting so long.

But the person he was waiting for never came.

There was no sign that she would.

(Why hasn't she come?)

He didn't know.

(Why am I here?)

He felt like he was teetering on the verge of
utter confusion.


{EOP010}
[Kid]
Oh well...

He shook his head and sighed.

It didn't seem his pants would dry any time
soon.


13 :

{EOP011}
[Park staff]
What's wrong?

He sensed a slight movement, and a girl sat down
next to him.


14 :
She was sporting the theme park uniform.

A white outfit with a bluish ribbon.

She looked like a guide.


{EOP012}
[Park staff]
Are you lost?

A beaming, innocent smile appeared on her
shining face.


{EOP013}
[Park staff]
Did you get separated from your friends?


{EOP014}
[Kid]
Yeah.


{EOP015}
[Kid]
I've been waiting.


15 :

{EOP016}
[Park staff]
Waiting?


{EOP017}
[Kid]
Well...


{EOP018}
[Kid]
I was waiting.


{EOP019}
[Park staff]
You were waiting...


16 :

{EOP020}
[Park staff]
For me?


{EOP021}
[Kid]
N-no...

Looking at her grin, he seemed to be flustered.



{EOP022}
[Kid]
I was told to wait here, so...


17 :

{EOP023}
[Park staff]
I see...


{EOP024}
[Park staff]
But it looks like they're not coming.

She gave him a sideways glance.


{EOP025}
[Park staff]
"Listen, you've obviously been stood up, and you're 
tired of waiting..."

18 :

{EOP026}
[Park staff]
I know!

Her face suddenly lit up, and she clapped her
hands together.


{EOP027}
[Park staff]
Hey, hey, you're alone, right?


{EOP028}
[Kid]
Huh?


{EOP029}
[Park staff]
"Well, you're bored, right? How about I give you 
a tour of LeMU?"

She tugged at his arm.

Without waiting for his reply, she made him
stand.


{EOP030}
[Kid]
B-but I'm waiting for someone.


19 :

{EOP031}
[Park staff]
Waiting? For who?


{EOP032}
[Kid]
...Uh...

Who was it?

He couldn't think of the name.


{EOP033}
[Park staff]
Well, I dunno who you're waiting for, but...


20 :

{EOP034}
[Park staff]
"If they haven't shown up yet, don't you think 
you've waited long enough?"

She said that happily, almost prancing around.


{EOP035}
[Park staff]
Whaddya say? How about it?


{EOP036}
[Kid]
Al-alright...

He nodded slightly.

The girl's nametag glittered brightly against
the white fabric of her uniform.


{EOP037}
[Kid]
<Y-O-U>...?

That was what it said.


21 :

{EOP038}
[Y¤u]
<I am You!>


{EOP039}
[Kid]
?

I am you...?


{EOP040}
[Y¤u]
Yup.

She nodded.


{EOP041}
[Y¤u]
My last name is Tanaka...


{EOP042}
[Y¤u]
And my first name is Y¤u...


{EOP043}
[Kid]
Y¤u...?


{EOP044}
[Y¤u]
My real name is much longer, though.


{EOP045}
[Kid]
Longer?


{EOP046}
[Y¤u]
Long, like, endlessly long. But...


{EOP047}
[Y¤u]
But it's such a pain... Just call me 'Y¤u'.


22 :

{EOP048}
[Y¤u]
Nice to meet you!

With that, she enthusiastically stuck out her
hand.

{EOP049}
[Kid]
N-nice to meet you?

Without thinking, he shook her hand.

And before he realized it, he'd been sucked
along into her rhythm.


23 :

{EOP050}
[Y¤u]
So shall we go?

They reluctantly released hands.

He looked once again at his hand, which had connected
them moments before.

The vanilla ice cream that had spilled on it
had completely melted away.


24 :
(Huh?)

He noticed that the two tanuki had formed a
line and were moving forward.

In front of them was a massive gate that had been
sealed shut.

The gate swung open soundlessly, and the big
tanuki, the little tanuki, and the girl went inside.


25 :
(Finally! My turn...)

He followed their footsteps.


26 :
That was LeMU's only entrance for visitors.


27 :
Several park employees waited at the gate and
handed over what looked like earphones to the
visitors.

It seemed that the earphones were to be used at
some point up ahead.

He wondered why.


28 :
Looking around skeptically, but obeying
instructions, he stepped into the building.


29 :
He surveyed the ceiling.

There were no windows. From the polished round
walls, it was clear that the room was
dome-shaped.

He looked around.

Many of the visitors who had been waiting in
line headed into the room.

Among them were friends, amorous couples,
and people with their families.

However, it seemed the 'Tanuki family' had split
up.

The big tanuki shoved its way through the crowd
of people and continued through a door on the
other side of the room.

The young girl stayed on the same side of the
room as the little tanuki.

(I've got no clue what those tanuki are all
about, but...)

(I guess my friends aren't here either...)

He didn't see any familiar faces around.

He figured maybe they had already taken the far
elevator downstairs.

Just 20 minutes earlier, the visitor room had
reached capacity...

And the friends he had been waiting with had
gone ahead, leaving him behind to go down with
the next group.

(Oh well. I'm sure I'll find everyone down
below soon enough.)

Finally, the gate to the entrance slipped shut
quietly.

The big tanuki fiddled with something on the
wall, and the room got a shade darker.


30 :

{EOP051}
[Park staff]
Hello, everybody!

A park employee emerged out of the darkness.

He wondered where she had come from. She was
wearing a flashy dress.

The dim light shining on her made her seem like
a character from some dream.


31 :
[Visitors]
...


{EOP052}
[Park staff]
What? No reaction, folks?


{EOP053}
[Park staff]
I'll try that again...


{EOP054}
[Park staff]
Hello!


{EOP055}
[Young Girl]
Hellooooo!

It was the girl who, just a little while ago,
had been attached to the rear of the large
tanuki.


32 :

{EOP056}
[Park staff]
Oh! I've found a girl with some spunk.


{EOP057}
[Park staff]
What's your name?


{EOP058}
[Young Girl]
I'm Ya-ga-mi £o-¢o!


{EOP059}
[£o¢o]
This is my pet dog, Pipi.


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

(So that isn't a tanuki, it's a dog.)

(I thought they didn't let pets in here...)

He tilted his head doubtfully.


{EOP060}
[Park staff]
"So, £o¢o-chan, how many times have you
been to LeMU?"


33 :

{EOP061}
[£o¢o]
Uh, well... One, two, three, four, five...


{EOP062}
[£o¢o]
This is my first time!


{EOP063}
[Park staff]
Heehee. Aren't you a funny girl?


{EOP064}
[£o¢o]
I get that a lot.


{EOP065}
[£o¢o]
You want me to do something even more funny?

34 :

{EOP066}
[Park staff]
What?


{EOP067}
[£o¢o]
My friend told me a good joke the other day!

35 :

{EOP068}
[Park staff]
O-ooh... Er... Maybe some other time.


{EOP069}
[£o¢o]
Why not?


{EOP070}
[Park staff]
"Because I have to tell everyone something right
now."


{EOP071}
[£o¢o]
Oh. Okay then...


{EOP072}
[£o¢o]
But it's really funny...


{EOP073}
[£o¢o]
That's too bad, huh, Pipi?


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!


36 :

{EOP074}
[Park staff]
Ahem. Once again...


37 :

{EOP075}
[Park staff]
"On behalf of the LeMU marine theme park, I'd 
like to thank you very much for coming."


{EOP076}
[Park staff]
"I am about to give you a brief explanation 
about the LeMU theme park and tell you a few 
things to watch out for."


{EOP077}
[£o¢o]
"Hey, who cares? Hurry up and let us inside 
already!"


{EOP078}
[Park staff]
I would love to take everyone inside...


{EOP079}
[Park staff]
But I'm terribly sorry.


{EOP080}
[Park staff]
"Everyone will actually have to stay in this 
room for now."


{EOP081}
[Park staff]
It will only take seventeen minutes.


{EOP082}
[Park staff]
So please just bear with me for that long.


38 :

{EOP083}
[Park staff]
"First, let me explain a bit about this room... 
It is called a compression chamber."


{EOP084}
[Park staff]
"Starting from now, the air pressure in here is 
going to rise to six atmospheres."


{EOP085}
[Park staff]
"Why do you think it is necessary to raise the 
air pressure? I'll explain the reason for it 
in a moment..."


39 :

{EOP086}
[Park staff]
"But before that, let me tell you a few things 
you should be aware of."


{EOP087}
[Park staff]
"As the air pressure rises, you may start to 
feel a strange sensation in your ears."


{EOP088}
[Park staff]
"Like when you are descending a mountain or in 
an airplane. It's because the increased air 
pressure is pressing on your ear drums."


40 :

{EOP089}
[Park staff]
"So if you think your ears feel a bit 
strange..."


{EOP090}
[Park staff]
"Pinch your nose with your fingers, close your 
mouth tight, and try to pop your ears."


{EOP091}
[Park staff]
"If that doesn't get your ears back to normal, 
or you if don't feel well, please raise your 
hand and let me know."


{EOP092}
[Park staff]
"In the event that happens, we will immediately 
stop increasing the air pressure."


41 :

{EOP093}
[Park staff]
"By the way, are there any people here who 
don't know how to pop their ears?"

[Park staff]
...


{EOP094}
[Park Staff]
Is everything clear then?

[Park staff]
...


42 :

{EOP095}
[Park staff]
"Alright then. We'll initiate the rise in
pressure."


{EOP096}
[Park staff]
"As I said before, the time required to increase 
the pressure is seventeen minutes."


{EOP097}
[Park staff]
"During that time, I will explain to 
everyone about the structure of LeMU."


43 :

{EOP098}
[Park staff]
"As you all know, LeMU is floating in the 
ocean..."


{EOP099}
[Park staff]
At a depth of between 17 and 51 meters...


44 :

{EOP100}
[Park staff]
"Now, if you look at this chart, you will see 
that the structure is divided into four layers."


{EOP101}
[Park staff]
"From the top, these are called Insel Null, 
Erster Boden, Zweiter Stock, and Dritter 
Stock..."


{EOP102}
[Park staff]
"In terms of a normal building, you might think 
of it as a structure with a ground floor 
extending down to a three-story basement."


{EOP103}
[Park staff]
Insel Null, here, is a floating island.


{EOP104}
[Park staff]
"It is an immense man-made island floating in
the ocean..."


{EOP105}
[Park staff]
"In German, 'insel' means 'island' and 'null'
means 'zero'."


{EOP106}
[Park staff]
"In other words, this is floor zero, or the
ground floor."


{EOP107}
[Park staff]
Next is from Erster to Dritter...

Just then.


{EOP108}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey. Hey, you.


{EOP109}
[£o¢o]
Hey, I'm talking to you.

As he was listening to the explanation, someone
pulled on him from behind.

He turned to look around.


45 :
It was the girl who had just been talking with
the park staff.

(What was her name again...?)


{EOP110}
[£o¢o]
Hey. Don't you want to know about my joke?

(Oh, that's right.)

(Her name was £o¢o.)

(And that animal she's holding is
Pepe, or Popo, or something...)


{EOP111}
[£o¢o]
You wanna know, don't you?


{EOP112}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What?


{EOP113}
[£o¢o]
"The joke I was just talking about. It's an 
Ame-joke."


{EOP114}
[Takeshi]
An ame... joke?


46 :

{EOP115}
[£o¢o]
"You haven't heard about them? They're real 
popular now, ya know."


{EOP116}
[Takeshi]
No, I haven't. What are you talking about?


47 :

{EOP117}
[£o¢o]
"An Ame-joke is an American joke. Get it? 
'Ame-joke'."


{EOP118}
[Takeshi]
Hm? Hmm...


{EOP119}
[£o¢o]
"Makes you wanna hear it, right? Want me to 
tell you?"


48 :
{11:0-00}
{11:1}Listen to the joke

{11:1}Listen to the staff member's explanation


49 :

{EOP120}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, I guess I'll listen to it.


50 :

{EOP121}
[£o¢o]
Okay! Here it goes!


51 :

{EOP122}
[£o¢o]
"Once, there was this guy who was talking to the 
ghost of his dead grandfather. So he asked him 
a question."


{EOP123}
[£o¢o]
"'How long is a million years to a ghost?', he 
asked."


{EOP124}
[£o¢o]
And the ghost answered.


{EOP125}
[£o¢o]
'A million years is like a second to me.'


{EOP126}
[£o¢o]
Next, the man asked...


{EOP127}
[£o¢o]
'How much is a million dollars to a ghost?'


{EOP128}
[£o¢o]
And the ghost answered.


{EOP129}
[£o¢o]
"'A million dollars? It is but one small cent 
to me.'"


{EOP130}
[£o¢o]
"When he heard that, the man pretended to smile 
all nice and then said..."


{EOP131}
[£o¢o]
"'Well then, gramps, how about giving me one of 
your cents?'"


{EOP132}
[£o¢o]
Laughing, the ghost replied.


{EOP133}
[£o¢o]
'Sure. Right away.'


{EOP134}
[£o¢o]
'But can I get you to wait just a second?'

[Takeshi]
...


{EOP135}
[£o¢o]
Heeheeheee...


52 :

{EOP136}
[£o¢o]
Waaahahaha!


{EOP137}
[£o¢o]
Well? That's a pretty good joke, huh?


53 :

{EOP138}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I suppose it could be worse, but... I'll 
talk to you later."


{EOP139}
[£o¢o]
Huh.

Patting the little dog's head, he turned back to
listen to the explanation.


54 :

{EOP140}
[Park staff]
"So now you should now have a general 
understanding of the layout of each floor."


{EOP141}
[Park staff]
"By the way, LeMU was designed with saturation 
diving specifications."


{EOP142}
[Park staff]
"In other words, the air pressure inside is 
equivalent to or greater than the water 
pressure outside."


{EOP143}
[Park staff]
As I said at the beginning...


{EOP144}
[Park staff]
"The complex that we're all going to enter is 
filled with a mixture of gases at 
six atmospheres."


{EOP145}
[Park staff]
"So right now our bodies are adjusting to be 
able to handle pressure equivalent to 
six atmospheres."


{EOP146}
[Park staff]
"Of course, this mixture of gases is composed of 
oxygen, nitrogen, and helium, and is completely 
harmless to people."


{EOP147}
[Park staff]
"The reason for raising the air pressure inside 
is..."


{EOP148}
[Park staff]
"That it is essential to make LeMU safe for 
everyone."


{EOP149}
[Park staff]
"Okay, everyone, we are now going to enter the 
ocean..."


{EOP150}
[Park staff]
"Are any of you here feeling just a little bit 
nervous?"


{EOP151}
[Park staff]
"You might be worrying about what would happen 
if seawater started leaking inside, or that you 
might be crushed by the water pressure, or us 
sinking."


{EOP152}
[Park staff]
"However, please relax. There is nothing to 
worry about."


{EOP153}
[Park staff]
"There is absolutely no way that LeMU could be 
crushed by the outside water pressure because 
we have raised the air pressure inside."


55 :

{EOP154}
[Park staff]
"By the way, before we entered this 
pressurization chamber, we handed out earphones 
to everyone, remember?"


{EOP155}
[Park staff]
"Yes, that's right, the earphones that everyone 
is using right now."


56 :

{EOP156}
[Park staff]
"These are not your average earphones. They are 
'voice alternators'."


{EOP157}
[Park staff]
"LeMU is pumped full of helium gas, so without 
these in your ears, you'll sound like a duck."

He removed his voice alternators to see what
would happen.


57 :
(Haha! It's true! People really do sound like
ducks.)

(Then again, maybe they sound more like aliens
than ducks.)

The voices of the people around him jumped to
a strange higher tone.


58 :

{EOP158}
[Takeshi]
Hey, say something.


{EOP159}
[£o¢o]
Like what?


{EOP160}
[Takeshi]
Hahaha! Your voice is hilarious.


{EOP161}
[£o¢o]
Huh? My voice?


59 :
£o¢o hadn't been listening to the explanation.


{EOP162}
[Takeshi]
Can you tell me that joke one more time?


{EOP163}
[£o¢o]
Why?


{EOP164}
[Takeshi]
C'mon, just do it.


{EOP165}
[£o¢o]
"Once, there was this guy who was talking to the 
ghost of his dead grandfather. So he asked him 
a question."


{EOP166}
[£o¢o]
"'How long is a million years to a ghost?', he 
asked."


{EOP167}
[£o¢o]
And the ghost answered.


{EOP168}
[Takeshi]
Heee... heee...


{EOP169}
[Takeshi]
Waaahaaaah!


60 :

{EOP170}
[£o¢o]
"What? That's weird. You didn't even laugh at 
all just a second ago."

He put the voice alternators back in his ears
and looked back at the staff member again.


61 :

{EOP171}
[£o¢o]
What's wrong with my voice?


{EOP172}
[Takeshi]
"Hahaha. You weren't listening to the 
explanation."


{EOP173}
[£o¢o]
"What are you laughing at? Why are you smiling 
like that?"


{EOP174}
[£o¢o]
You're acting really weird.


{EOP175}
[Takeshi]
"Well, why don't you try listening to your own 
voice?"


{EOP176}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


{EOP177}
[Takeshi]
"It's so funny. You sound like an eight-legged 
alien."


62 :

{EOP178}
[£o¢o]
"Alien? Alien as in 'Take us to your leader'... 
goooba joooba doooba space alien?"


{EOP179}
[£o¢o]
"Like a Martian or someone from Planet Kuikui, 
or something?"


{EOP180}
[£o¢o]
"A star person? From the far edge of the galaxy, 
with lasers...?"

[Takeshi]
...


63 :

{EOP181}
[£o¢o]
My joke was a lot funnier than THAT!


{EOP182}
[Takeshi]
Hee... haha...


{EOP183}
[Takeshi]
Waaahaaaah!


{EOP184}
[Takeshi]
"That's enough. I can't take any more of this. 
Thanks."

He put the voice alternators back in his ears
and looked back at the staff member again.



64 :

{EOP185}
[Park staff]
And that pretty much covers it.


{EOP186}
[Park staff]
"In approximately one minute, the door on this 
side of the room will open."


{EOP187}
[Park staff]
"On the other side of that door is an elevator, 
and at the bottom of it, a brilliant paradise
awaits."


{EOP188}
[Park staff]
"We hope that you enjoy yourself to your heart's 
content here at the marine theme park LeMU."


65 :

{EOP189}
[Takeshi]
Well, shall we go...?

Just as he headed for the elevator...


{EOP190}
[£o¢o]
So are you here by yourself?


{EOP191}
[Takeshi]
Who, me? No, I got separated from my friends.


{EOP192}
[£o¢o]
So you're lost?


{EOP193}
[Takeshi]
Not exactly. But something like that.


{EOP194}
[Takeshi]
"I'll head down the elevator and take a look 
around."


66 :

{EOP195}
[£o¢o]
"How about checking with that girl who was just 
talking?"


{EOP196}
[Takeshi]
Oh, I suppose I could do that. Excuse me...


67 :
Looking back, he saw that the employee had
already disappeared.


68 :

{EOP197}
[Y¤u]
Hmmmm. So you came to LeMU by yourself?


{EOP198}
[Kid]
Yup. That's right.


69 :

{EOP199}
[Y¤u]
Even so...

After bending down to wipe away the white stain
on his pants, Y¤u stood up.


{EOP200}
[Y¤u]
"You don't see that very often, a guy coming to 
a park like this alone."

That was true.

It was paradise‡Lan amusement park.

In that instant, he had almost forgotten even
that.


70 :

{EOP201}
[Y¤u]
"So why didn't you go into the park with your 
friends?"


{EOP202}
[Y¤u]
Why arrange to meet inside LeMU?


{EOP203}
[Kid]
Huh? Th-that's because...

Now that she mentioned it...

Who HAD said to wait on that bench...?


Whose idea was it anyway?


71 :

{EOP204}
[Y¤u]
Oh well. Whatever, I won't push you.

[Kid]
.........

Who was it...?


{EOP205}
[Y¤u]
But I suppose that... Well, I mean...


72 :

{EOP206}
[Y¤u]
You've kind of been stood up... Right?


{EOP207}
[Kid]
What?


{EOP208}
[Kid]
Stood... up?

Stood up...

It took a moment for the meaning of the phrase to
register.

[Kid]
............


73 :

{EOP209}
[Y¤u]
"Wow! I hit the nail on the head, didn't I? Uh... 
Sorry..."


74 :
She shrugged slightly, embarrassed.


75 :

{EOP210}
[Y¤u]
Well, well. Don't get depressed about it!

She changed modes abruptly and let out a hearty
laugh.

She slapped him solidly on the back.


{EOP211}
[Y¤u]
I'll look out for you. Alright?


{EOP212}
[Kid]
Al-alright.

He nodded, a bit overwhelmed.

(So...)

(I was stood up...)

(I must have been dumped...)

(Huh...?)

Then again, he wasn't sure exactly what had
happened.


76 :

{EOP213}
[Kid]
But...


77 :

{EOP214}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What?


{EOP215}
[Kid]
Aren't you working right now, Y¤u?


78 :

{EOP216}
[Y¤u]
You'd make a scary boss.

No matter how many times he checked, she was
definitely still wearing a LeMU uniform.


{EOP217}
[Y¤u]
"I didn't have anything to do anyway. It's 
perfect timing. Yeah."

They got in an egg-like elevator together.


79 :
The egg slowly began to move.

It felt like they were slowly floating up.


80 :

{EOP218}
[Y¤u]
Going up...

She whispered mischievously.

[Kid]
............

The elevator was terribly crowded.

And everyone was packed in like sardines.


{EOP219}
[Y¤u]
Whoa... It's a little hot, huh?


{EOP220}
[Kid]
I'll say...

Her face was so close that he almost bumped into it.


Their bodies were flush against each other.
She was soft and warm.

He was surprised.

All of a sudden, he felt embarrassed and
started to squirm.


81 :

{EOP221}
[Y¤u]
Hey, kid.


{EOP222}
[Y¤u]
Don't go touching places you shouldn't...

She whispered into his ear, puffing out her
cheeks.

Crammed in the elevator, he couldn't move at all.



82 :

{EOP223}
[Y¤u]
That tickles... Don't move so much.


{EOP224}
[Kid]
I don't have a lot of choice.


{EOP225}
[Kid]
I can't... breathe.

He couldn't move, but he couldn't bear standing
still either.

As he gasped for breath, he noticed her light
perfume.


83 :
Finally, the egg arrived at the top floor, and his
suffering was over.


84 :

{EOP226}
[Kid]
Whew!

He let out a cry and bolted from the elevator.


85 :

{EOP227}
[Y¤u]
What... What's with you all of a sudden?


86 :

{EOP228}
[Y¤u]
Hey! Wait! Kid! Kid!

He sprinted away, leaving Y¤u far behind.


87 :
It wasn't that he was trying to escape from her.


He'd seen something.

At the edge of his vision, he thought he'd seen
someone.

Up ahead... that someone was still visible.

He chased after whoever it was like a man
possessed.

(I've seen that face before...)

(I'm sure I've seen that face before.)

That was what his instincts were telling him.

But where had he seen them?

He tried to sort through his foggy memory.

As he sifted, he kept running forward.


{EOP229}
[Kid]
Wait...!

He felt a desperate need to meet the person.

But he had to hurry.


88 :

{EOP230}
[Kid]
*Huff*... *puff*...

Eventually, he ran out of breath.

Holding his pounding chest, he looked up.


{EOP231}
[Kid]
Ah!


89 :
(There she was!)

Mixed amongst the other people was a girl,
standing.

He was sure that the person that he had been
searching for was that girl.

It was the middle of the holidays, but for
some reason she was wearing her school
uniform...

He wondered why she was alone there.

(Oh yeah... I've got to talk to her...)

She was by herself.

She was all alone. Just like him.

(What should I say...?)

(Where should I start... Let's see...)

He needed to calm down and focus.

(Huh...?)

(Why is it I have to talk to her...?)

(Why in the world?)

Who was she?

Who was... she...?

She was...

Well, she was...


90 :

{EOP232}
[Kid]
Aaagh!

91 :


92 :
He was caught up in a wave of people.

[Kid]
...

He got pushed into an elevator. It started to
rise toward the surface.


93 :
Seventeen meters below sea level, the elevator stopped
at the first basement floor.

He got off the elevator as if he were being
spit out.

This floor is called Erster Boden...

He glanced around at his surroundings.

She wasn't anywhere to be seen.

He thought that they had both ridden on the
elevator together...

But he had apparently lost sight of her in the
crowd when he got off.

He lost her...

He hadn't even been able to say a word.

He felt really depressed.

(Maybe...)

(Did she call out to me?)

That idea suddenly popped into his head.


94 :

{EOP233}
[Kid]
What is this... This feeling...?

His heart was still beating furiously.


95 :

{EOP234}
[Park staff]
Is something the matter?

A uniformed staff member, different than Y¤u,
was talking to him.


{EOP235}
[Park staff]
Are you looking for someone?

She gave him a warm smile as she said that.


{EOP236}
[Kid]
Eh! Uh, uh... Yes, I am.

Feeling that he seemed a little desperate, he
quickly blurted out an answer.


{EOP237}
[Kid]
I'm trying to find someone!


{EOP238}
[Kid]
"I was supposed to meet up with them, but we 
must have missed each other."


{EOP239}
[Park staff]
Who is it? What is their name?


{EOP240}
[Kid]
Uh, their name...


{EOP241}
[???]
Hey! You there! Wait!


96 :
Patter, patter, patter.

Suddenly, the sounds of footsteps came rushing
at him.


{EOP242}
[Kid]
Huh? You mean me?


97 :

{EOP243}
[Man]
Yes. That's right...

Running feet braked sharply beside him.

The guy was out of breath.


98 :

{EOP244}
[Man]
Actually, I want to ask you something.


{EOP245}
[Kid]
Huh?

Surprised, he slowly opened his mouth.


99 :

{EOP246}
[Takeshi]
Hey, you don't know, do you?

There was nothing to do but see where the
conversation went.


100 :

{EOP247}
[Takeshi]
"Sorry to ask you like this out of the blue, but 
you don't know, do you?"


{EOP248}
[Takeshi]
"You haven't seen my friends around here, have 
you?"


{EOP249}
[Takeshi]
"One of them is about 1.5 meters tall and around 
60 kilograms. Kind of good-looking, with dorky
sunglasses, and probably not the type girls would go for."


{EOP250}
[Takeshi]
"Another was wearing a suit, no tie, short hair, 
and has three piercings in his ear and one in his 
nose. He likes to knit..."


{EOP251}
[Takeshi]
"And then there was the only girl in the group, 
who had on a kind of simple color flower print 
one-piece with frilly lace..."


{EOP252}
[Takeshi]
"You know, three people you might see 
anywhere..."


{EOP253}
[Takeshi]
Did you see them?


101 :

{EOP254}
[Kid]
Nope.

The young kid shook his head.


{EOP255}
[Takeshi]
"I see. Well, sorry about stopping you like 
that."


102 :
Waving slightly, he left.


103 :
The youth continued down the corridor ahead.


104 :
A girl came over to him and started talking to
him enthusiastically.

He thought he had seen her before.

(Huh... I wonder if she knows that kid.)


105 :
But a troubled expression appeared on his face.


106 :

{EOP256}
[£o¢o]
Hey, hey! Do you want to hear a joke?


{EOP257}
[Kid]
Huh? What? Who are you?

(So that's it...)

She was probably one of those kinds of people
that would talk to anyone about anything
anywhere, whether they were interested or not.


107 :
He thought he would go down below.

The elevator arrived soundlessly and swallowed
the waiting patrons.

He went with them farther into the depths of
LeMU.


108 :
He walked around aimlessly.


109 :
The attractions were all packed with visitors.

Everyone had beaming smiles and yelled
happily‡Lall evidence of LeMU's popularity.

But still... Wandering around a packed and lively
amusement park all alone was a bit tortuous.


He couldn't help trudging around with heavy feet
and slumped shoulders.

He was on the verge of looking depressed, but
he held his expression in check.


110 :

{EOP258}
[Takeshi]
What am I gonna do?

Walking around blindly in that place, he thought
he might never run into his friends.

The floor was a lot wider than he'd imagined.


{EOP259}
[Takeshi]
Oh right, my cell phone...

He took his PDA multi-purpose communication
device out from his pocket.

He pushed a button.

He didn't have any messages. No mail either. But
the problem seemed to be...

It was out of range.

At least that was what the display said.


{EOP260}
[Takeshi]
Are you serious!?


{EOP261}
[Takeshi]
"I didn't think you could get out of range in
this day and age..."

Then he recalled they'd said something about
it being a giant tunnel in the middle of the
ocean where only select radio waves could
reach.

And that LeMU used special electronic equipment
which wasn't very compatible with mobile
equipment.

More than anything, they didn't allow PDAs to
work inside so the facility would be completely
separated from the world above as part of the
attraction.

...At least that was what they'd told him at the
entrance, but he hadn't listened to a word of
it.


111 :
(Maybe I should get them to broadcast a message
over the intercom...?)

He thought it might be best to just ask a staff
member.

He decided to look for one.

But there wasn't a uniformed person in sight.

There weren't many people walking around the
corridors either.


112 :
He turned a corner and entered a completely
different corridor.


113 :
There, right in front of him, was the giant
tanuki...

It was the one he'd seen at the gate while
coming in...

The tanuki was operating a panel on the wall...


(I'll bet that's a LeMU employee.)

Thinking it perfect timing, he saddled up to the
tanuki and called out.


{EOP262}
[Takeshi]
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. A friend.


{EOP263}
[Takeshi]
"Could I get you to make an announcement over 
the intercom or something? The name 
is... Uh..."


114 :
The tanuki slowly turned around and looked at
him.

[Tanuki]
............

But it didn't say anything.


{EOP264}
[Takeshi]
Uh? Hello? Hello?


115 :
The tanuki turned away, avoiding him.

He was being ignored.

(I wonder if it didn't hear me.)

The tanuki was wearing a big stuffed suit and
was a full head taller than him.

There was the definite possibility that his
words weren't even reaching the ears inside.


116 :

{EOP265}
[Takeshi]
HELLOOOooo. Can you hear me in there?

He asked the question nicely as he poked the
tanuki in the ribs.


{EOP266}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, you've gotta lot of extra flesh here, 
buddy."

He continued talking as he pinched, pulled, and
released the tanuki's flank.


117 :
He thought that for a mascot suit, the tanuki
shot him a pretty realistic glare before it
turned to walk away.

Upset at that, he grabbed the tanuki's
shoulder.


{EOP267}
[Takeshi]
"Hey! What kind of an attitude is that? And when 
a visitor's in trouble!"


118 :
Whump!


119 :

{EOP268}
[Takeshi]
Umpph!


{EOP269}
[Takeshi]
~~~~~~!?


120 :
He'd been gut-punched.

The tanuki had actually slugged him.

Not even his parents had ever even really
spanked him before.

It had been a totally cheap shot‡Lthe tanuki
had landed a solid uppercut.


{EOP270}
[Takeshi]
H-hey...! Tanuki...! Yeah, I mean you!

[Tanuki]
.........

He went down on his knees and keeled over.

Nearby visitors reacted.


{EOP271}
[Park staff]
Is everything alright?


121 :
Just then, a park employee appeared from the
door.


{EOP272}
[Park staff]
Are you having stomach pains?


122 :
{11:0-02}
{11:1}It was the tanuki

{11:1}Forget it


123 :

{EOP273}
[Takeshi]
...That tanuki caught me with a body blow...


124 :

{EOP274}
[Park staff]
Huh?

The employee gave him a surprised look.


{EOP275}
[Takeshi]
I got sucker punched by that tanuki!

He pointed at the big tanuki.

[Tanuki]
.........

The tanuki's expression didn't change.


125 :
But it turned and started to run.


126 :
The tanuki's silhouette pranced lightly away
into the distance.


127 :
And in an instant, it had disappeared down the
walkway.

[Takeshi]
.........


128 :
[Park staff]
.........


129 :

{EOP276}
[Park staff]
Uh, that is, um, a...

The staff member looked after the tanuki as she
spoke.


{EOP277}
[Park staff]
That's not a tanuki, that's a lemur.


{EOP278}
[Takeshi]
Le-lemu... What?

He rubbed his still-aching stomach as he spoke.


130 :

{EOP279}
[Park staff]
Yes. A lemur. You know, a fox-like monkey.


{EOP280}
[Park staff]
Its name is Myumyun.


131 :
LeMU had been named after the continent of
Lemuria.

A legendary land.

According to the British zoologist Sclater,
the Lemurian continent preceded the existence
of islands scattered throughout the Indian
Ocean.

{16:4}

132 :
Lemurs were scattered throughout Africa, the
island of Madagascar, Asia, and Indonesia.

While investigating the distribution of those
fox-monkeys, Sclater came to believe a continent
had existed in the Indian Ocean, adopting the
British geologist Brandford's hypothesis.



{1}He named that continent Lemuria.

Moreover, the German zoologist Haeckel
contended that the continent was the origin of
mankind.

{16:4}

133 :

{EOP281}
[Park staff]
Myumyun is one of LeMU's mascots.


134 :

{EOP282}
[Park staff]
But what happened? Are you ill? Or...


{EOP283}
[Takeshi]
No. I'm fine now. Don't worry about me...


{EOP284}
[Takeshi]
It's over anyway.


135 :

{EOP285}
[Park staff]
Oh, I see...


136 :

{EOP286}
[Takeshi]
It's nothing. I just took a tumble.


137 :

{EOP287}
[Park staff]
Is that so?

He couldn't bring himself to say that the tanuki
had floored him with one punch...

[Tanuki]
.........


138 :
The big tanuki turned its back and ran.


139 :
The tanuki's silhouette pranced lightly away
into the distance.


140 :
A moment later, it had disappeared up the
hallway ahead.


141 :

{EOP288}
[Park staff]
Oh. I wonder what happened to that Myumyun.

The staff member looked after the tanuki as she
spoke.


{EOP289}
[Park staff]
"You're probably thinking I should be getting
back to my post, right...? Oh well."


142 :
She looked at him again and smiled, laughing.


{EOP290}
[Park staff]
If you need anything, don't hesitate to call.


143 :
The staff member disappeared.

(I see...)

(That wasn't a tanuki, that was 'Myumyun'.)


144 :
He wasn't sure why Myumyun had hauled off and
punched him.

But he knew that wondering about it wouldn't
help.

So he decided to forget about it.

He needed to be getting somewhere.


{EOP291}
[Takeshi]
I'll look around on my own a little more...

He muttered that as he composed himself.

He knew there should be several attractions at
the other end of the corridor.

His friends might have been looking for him as
they waited in line.


{EOP292}
[Takeshi]
So which way should I go?

His legs were so tired that he could barely
move.

(This is...)

(The world's worst theme park...)

And that was exactly how he felt.


145 :

{EOP293}
[Kid]
Oh well...

Hit by a slight dizzy spell, he leaned against
the wall.


{EOP294}
[Kid]
What in the world...?

He sighed.

He was fully and utterly beat.

The staff member that had just been talking to him
had vanished somewhere.

Y¤u wasn't around either.

He had lost sight of the other girl as well.

He was alone again.


{EOP295}
[Kid]
What did I come here for? I...


146 :
He thought that maybe he should have waited
where he was before after all.

Having lost his destination, he rode the
elevator from the aquarium and returned to
basement floor two.


147 :
Basement floor two‡LZweiter Stock.

(The second floor...?)

(I screwed up...)

(The rest area is down one more level.)

He felt like he had come a long way from the
elevator room.

He didn't know which path he should take to go
down.

Which way...


148 :

{EOP296}
[???]
Could you come here for a moment?

A voice called to him from somewhere.

From somewhere...


{EOP297}
[Kid]
!?

From the shadows of the path, the owner of the
voice was beckoning to him.

But the hand did not belong to a human.


149 :

{EOP298}
[???]
Look, hurry up, will you?

It was the whispering voice of a young woman.

Her bulky, black arm was swaying rhythmically.

Disturbed by the difference between the voice
and its owner's appearance, he moved, hypnotized,
in its direction.

The hand and arm clearly belonged to a tanuki.

It was a big tanuki.


150 :

{EOP299}
[Tanuki]
Do you know where we are?

He was led by the tanuki into a room at the end
of the walkway.

Or rather... Packed into it.


{EOP300}
[Kid]
This is...

(Is this the girl's changing room...?)

He saw a uniform, like the one Y¤u had been
wearing, packed away inside an open locker.

(Hey... I can even see some women's underwear...)


The room smelled like perfume.

The air was saturated with a scent so strong it
almost made him choke.

The smell was about to overwhelm him.

He struggled to get his mind under control and
maintain his focus.


151 :

{EOP301}
[Tanuki]
Hey, do you know where we are?

The tanuki asked the same question again.

Come to think of it... why was she a tanuki
anyway?

He had no clue.


{EOP302}
[Kid]
This...


{EOP303}
[Tanuki]
...Is the changing room.

She said that before he could answer.


{EOP304}
[Tanuki]
Changing rooms are...


{EOP305}
[Tanuki]
"A place to keep secrets away from prying
eyes..."

She said that quietly.


{EOP306}
[Kid]
Secrets?


152 :
Wham!

Suddenly, his vision faded.

Everything went completely dark.


{EOP307}
[Kid]
Huh?


{EOP308}
[Tanuki]
Will you look after this for me?


{EOP309}
[Kid]
Huh? What? What?

Look after?

He didn't understand.


{EOP310}
[Tanuki]
Here, I'll help you put it on right.


{EOP311}
[Kid]
Uh, um...

Wear it?

He had no idea what she was talking about.


{EOP312}
[Kid]
Uh, wuh, whoa...

He didn't understand why, but he couldn't move.


He was powerless to resist her, and he let her do
what she wanted.

In a moment, something completely covered his
body.

[Kid]
.........


{EOP313}
[Tanuki]
Heehee. This should do it...


{EOP314}
[Tanuki]
Alright then. I'll leave the rest to you.

And the light sound of her footsteps faded into
the distance.


153 :
The last thing he heard was the click of a door
shutting...

[Kid]
.........

He heard the sound.

But he did not see her leave.


{EOP315}
[Kid]
.........?

(What did she do to me?)


His face felt heavy...

His body felt heavy...

He had tunnel vision...

And for some reason, his body was bristling with
hair...

(Could it be...)

(That this is... the mascot outfit...)

When he shook his head, it made a sound like
bristles brushing something.

And there was a smell.

There was some other scent from inside the
costume.

A sweet smell that made him dizzy.

It pierced deep into his brain...

Before he knew what was going on, he had opened
the door and was shuffling out into the pathway.


154 :

{EOP316}
[Takeshi]
Ahh!

Without thinking, he let out a cry.

He had found it.

(It's that tanuki...)


155 :
He had just been told that it was not a tanuki,
but Myumyun the fox-monkey; that
information had already disappeared from his
mind.


156 :
He had just heard that it was not a tanuki, but
Myumyun the fox-monkey; that information had
already disappeared from his mind.


157 :
(I forgot its name...)

(It doesn't matter, though. That's the person that
hit me and ran away.)

He didn't want revenge...

But he did want to ask it why it had done what
it did.


158 :
Without making a sound, he slowly approached
the tanuki‡Lmascot‡LMyumyun.


159 :
And as soon as he got behind it, he quickly
grabbed the costume by the head.


160 :
There!


{EOP317}
[Kid]
Who... Who're you?


{EOP318}
[Takeshi]
I should be asking you that!


{EOP319}
[Takeshi]
Why would you do something like that!?


{EOP320}
[Kid]
Huh? What'd I do?


{EOP321}
[Takeshi]
Don't play dumb with me.


{EOP322}
[Kid]
I have no idea what you're talking about...


{EOP323}
[Takeshi]
You... You hit me!


{EOP324}
[Kid]
No I didn't! I have no idea what you mean!


{EOP325}
[Takeshi]
Liar! What? Did you forget?


{EOP326}
[Kid]
I'm not lying. This girl...


{EOP327}
[Kid]
Gave me this outfit out of nowhere and...


{EOP328}
[Takeshi]
What? You just met her? When did you change?


{EOP329}
[Kid]
I just put it on. I...


{EOP330}
[Takeshi]
Just put it on? What are you talking about?


{EOP331}
[Kid]
But why do this...


{EOP332}
[Kid]
This...


161 :
At that point, the tanuki collapsed.

He collapsed in full Myumyun regalia.


162 :

{EOP333}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what? Hey!

Takeshi shook his shoulders, but there was no
response.


{EOP334}
[Takeshi]
"Somebody come quick! Something's not right
here."

He yelled.

Visitors watched from a distance.


163 :

{EOP335}
[Park staff]
What's the matter?

A female employee had heard the fuss and came
running.


{EOP336}
[Takeshi]
"Huh? You're that girl from before... This guy 
just collapsed all of a sudden."


164 :

{EOP337}
[Park staff]
Let me see!


165 :
The employee took the pulse of the fallen
youth.

Takeshi wondered if she had any medical
knowledge.


166 :

{EOP338}
[Park staff]
"He's alright... but we can't leave him here 
like this."


{EOP339}
[Takeshi]
I'll help.


{EOP340}
[Park staff]
Great, thanks.


167 :
Why had such a thing happened?

He had no idea.

No idea...

Where he was.

Where he had gone.

Shaking.

Shaken.

Feeling ill.

He could feel hair from the costume rubbing
along both of his sides as two people carried
him.

Rubbing...

He wished they'd get the mascot suit off him
quickly.

The fur felt nasty.

It was hot.

So hot.

So hot he couldn't stand it.

The heat made him feel faint.

His consciousness felt like it would drift away.


Why had such a thing happened?

It was strange.

So strange...

It wasn't him or her.

He heard a different voice from somewhere...


168 :
He had been hauled to the infirmary.


169 :

{EOP341}
[Park staff]
I wonder what it could be? Is he anemic?


{EOP342}
[Takeshi]
"Maybe it was the mascot suit? Maybe he couldn't
get used to wearing it."


{EOP343}
[Park staff]
It's possible. It could be heat exhaustion...


{EOP344}
[Takeshi]
Does... it look like he'll be okay?


170 :

{EOP345}
[Park staff]
"It doesn't appear to be anything serious. A 
little rest and he should be fine."


{EOP346}
[Takeshi]
I see.


{EOP347}
[Park staff]
Thanks for your help. I'll take it from here.


{EOP348}
[Takeshi]
Oh, alright then.


171 :
He opened the sliding door and left the room.


172 :

{EOP349}
[Takeshi]
Whew... Saving people can sure be stressful.


{EOP350}
[Takeshi]
What was it I came here to do?

A cool breeze was blowing along the walkway.


173 :
Breeze...

But where was it coming from?

He...

He wondered where he had come from.


174 :
He saw something faintly.

A ceiling.

Sheets.

A bed...

He had been put to sleep on a bed.

On a bed in the infirmary...

He saw something again.

Below the sick room... bed...


175 :
Who was on the bed below?

(Who is this?)

(This...)

(This isn't me...)

(...Of course not...)


176 :
He decided to go farther down the hall.

The third floor underground‡Lthey had called it
Dritter Stock...

(The guys... They've gotta be lined up waiting
for a crowded ride somewhere.)


177 :

{EOP351}
[Takeshi]
Hey, sorry! I'm getting in!

He dashed into the elevator.

The doors reopened silently and closed again.


178 :
(Huh?)

One other person had gotten on.

A girl.

A girl...

(More like a young woman, I guess.)

One girl had gotten on.

She was about high school age.

The elevator floated upward an instant before
descending.

There was the faint sound of movement and
vibration.


179 :
And then his eyes met with the girl's.

He wondered why...

The girl stared at him suspiciously.


{EOP352}
[Girl]
...What?


{EOP353}
[Girl]
Just who are you...?


{EOP354}
[Girl]
Why are you here?


{EOP355}
[Girl]
Why are you following me...?


180 :
{11:0-04}
{11:1}Apologize

{11:1}Just who exactly are you?

{11:1}Stay silent


181 :

{EOP356}
[Takeshi]
I'm sorry.

He didn't recall seeing her, but he nodded
slightly in apology.


{EOP357}
[Takeshi]
Did I do something to offend you?


182 :

{EOP358}
[Girl]
...Not really...


{EOP359}
[Takeshi]
.........?

He was getting more and more confused.

[Girl]
.........


{EOP360}
[Girl]
...I mean...


{EOP361}
[Girl]
This elevator is... for employees only.


{EOP362}
[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.


183 :

{EOP363}
[Takeshi]
Just who exactly are you?


{EOP364}
[Takeshi]
Did I do something wrong?


{EOP365}
[Girl]
Yes, you did. Just now...


{EOP366}
[Takeshi]
Just now?

He was getting more and more confused.


184 :
[Girl]
.........


{EOP367}
[Girl]
I mean...


{EOP368}
[Girl]
"I don't... want you to get in the way, that's
all."


{EOP369}
[Takeshi]
Get in the way of what?


185 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Girl]
.........


186 :
She avoided his eyes.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Girl]
.........

He felt like the air around him had suddenly
gotten much heavier.


187 :
‡LBoom!


188 :
Jolting suddenly, the elevator stopped.


189 :
He looked at the ceiling.

The lights flickered unsteadily.


{EOP370}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what was that!?


{EOP371}
[Girl]
It couldn't be...


{EOP372}
[Takeshi]
Couldn't be? Couldn't be what?


190 :
Couldn't be?

He wondered if something had gone terribly
wrong.

It was strange.

Very strange...


191 :
(Who's this?)

(Oh, it's her.)

(We've finally met...)

(I've been looking for you this whole time...)

But his voice didn't reach her.

‡L‡L‡L‡L,‡L‡L‡L‡L

‡L‡L‡L‡L

‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L

He couldn't hear her voice either.

No matter how much he tried...

No sounds reached him.

(Damn... What's going on...?)


192 :
But he faintly saw a figure.

He was able to make sure.

He could see himself and the girl talking over
there.

He saw it on the other side...

(I...)

(I can see myself over there...?)

He watched.

And he watched.


193 :
(That's strange...)

(No... It's odd...)

(If I'm watching them, then who is the 'me'
watching me?)

Something felt out of place.

He knew the truth, and his lips trembled.

(Who is that...?)

(Who could the 'me' over there be?)

He couldn't shake the feeling that something
was wrong.

It was like a dream.

It was like he was watching the continuation
of a dream.


194 :
But a dream couldn't have felt so powerfully
raw.

All of the screaming.

And the sound of running feet.

The shrill wailing of sirens.

That wasn't a dream or an illusion.


195 :

{EOP373}
[Takeshi]
"Couldn't be? Do you know something about
this?"


{EOP374}
[Girl]
I don't know anything...


{EOP375}
[Girl]
Do you know something?


{EOP376}
[Takeshi]
How could I know anything?

The lights gradually dimmed and finally went
out.


196 :
Why?

He had no idea.

He didn't know...

There was no way he could know.


197 :
But there on the bed.

There...

On the bed...

There...


198 :
The bed below, the bed on top, the bed below...


Who are...

(You...?)

Who...?

(Stop...)

Please stop.

(Don't come out...)

Please don't come out.

(Stay inside...)

Don't crawl out of there.

(Stop... Plea...)

S-st... sto... stop...


199 :
No...

There was nothing to fear.

It was alright.

Because there was no longer anyone.

Because there was no one there.


200 :

{EOP377}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Who's there? Is there somebody there?


{EOP378}
[Takeshi]
I'm here! I'm still in here!


{EOP379}
[Takeshi]
Somebody, get me out of here!


{EOP380}
[Takeshi]
Answer me... Please...


201 :

{EOP381}
[Kid]
Isn't there anyone there?

Nobody answered.

The surroundings were filled with silence.


{EOP382}
[Kid]
What? Is anybody there?


{EOP383}
[Kid]
So I'm alone... Heeheehee.

He burst with laughter.

The ultimate feeling of liberation.

There was no one to restrain him anymore.


{EOP384}
[Kid]
Ahahaha!


202 :
And he ran.

But no one stopped him.

Getting there was easy.

All that was left was to aim for the 'center'.

Just take a step.

It was simple.


203 :
He threw his body into the water.

He sank.


204 :
Deeper, deeper, and deeper...


205 :
Sound died away.

The embrace of unbelievably pure silence.

Not even a beam of light pierced the darkness.

All he could hear was repetitive heavy
breathing.


206 :
He lost himself, his mind short-circuiting.

His vision narrowed and was overrun with blue.

Deep blue.

Blue...

Something was strange...

He wondered if it really was blue.


207 :
Even though he was perfectly still, it seemed
as if his heart was racing.

Sweat poured off of him.

His breathing was ragged and labored.


208 :
Gradually, his consciousness dissolved into the
darkness.

Black.

Endless black.

There was no mistaking it this time...

Everything was stained black.

There were no boundaries to the color.


209 :
His ears hurt. The ringing in them wouldn't
stop.

He felt pressure expanding in his lungs.

He felt queasy, sick to his stomach.


{EOP385}
[Girl]
The air pressure... is dropping...

(I forgot... I need to pop my ears...)

With a pop, the air building inside his ears
was released.


{EOP386}
[Takeshi]
Damn...


{EOP387}
[Takeshi]
Which way is the exit...?


210 :
‡LPitch black.

Nothing moved.

He didn't move either.

There wasn't any sign of a breeze.

He didn't hear anything.

Just echoes from something invisible.

Time froze to a stop.

If he stopped there, he felt like he would forget
that he was even alive.

It was his intuition.

Only a little more...

No!

It was no good.

He had to get out.

But he didn't even know which direction to go.

He had to get... himself out of the darkness...
Had to...

But what could he do?

What could...

He didn't know.

He didn't know...

...


211 :
Just then, he felt a faint, warm light.

Light...?

A blade of light slicing through the flat world
of darkness.

And he knew...

The direction was over there...

And that there might be a way out...

If he could get over there...


212 :
{11:0-07}
{11:1}I've got to find my friends...

{11:1}Who am I?


213 :
I've got to find them.

I quietly

opened the door.


214 :
I didn't know where I was, but I

quietly

opened my eyes.
