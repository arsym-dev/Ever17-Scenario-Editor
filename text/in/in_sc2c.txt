After that...

We gathered at the rest area, had a light meal,
and chatted it up.

From beginning to end, Sora's explanation of
the RSD system dominated the conversation.

During the talk, I discovered something of
interest.

I learned that Sara was supposed to be amazing
when it came to computers.

Sara was floored the day before when she heard
that Sora was computer-generated. But when
Sora gave her a technical explanation, she
was able to absorb it all without any problem.

Y¤u said about Sara...


2 :

{S2C062}
[Y¤u]
Mayo? She's a hacker.

[Kid]
Hacker?


3 :

{S2C063}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. How should I explain this... I guess you 
could say a computer expert of sorts."


4 :

{S2C064}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, she knows everything about computers. 
And she kicks butt when it comes to 
programming too."


5 :

{S2C065}
[Y¤u]
"She writes programs for fun. Just the other 
day, she got first place in some cracking 
contest..."

[Kid]
Cracking contest?


6 :

{S2C066}
[Y¤u]
"A contest to break codes. Just so you know, 
it's not illegal."


{S2C067}
[Y¤u]
"It was sponsored by some company with code 
technology. It was legal cracking to test their 
security..."


{S2C068}
[Y¤u]
"The company has hackers attack their 
algorithms."


7 :

{S2C069}
[Y¤u]
"Just think of it as a decryption game 
contest."

[Kid]
Oh, so it's a game.


8 :

{S2C077}
[Y¤u]
"Just because you call it a game, I wouldn't 
take it lightly."


9 :

{S2C078}
[Y¤u]
"There were engineers participating from all 
over the world."


{S2C079}
[Y¤u]
"Winning it means that you're one of the 
world's best hackers."


10 :

{S2C080}
[Y¤u]
You could even say THE best hacker.

[Kid]
THE best...?

[Kid]
That's just way too incredible.


11 :

{S2C081}
[Y¤u]
I know.


{S2C082}
[Y¤u]
When it comes to computers... she's a genius.


12 :
That about rounded out the topic of RSD.

At the end of the conversation, Sora added...



13 :

{T2C227}
[Sora]
I...


14 :

{T2C228}
[Sora]
I am only 'seen' when someone looks at me.


15 :

{T2C229}
[Sora]
"I mean that I cease to exist 
when no one is looking at me."


16 :

{T2C230}
[Sora]
"For example, if the five of you here all 
closed your eyes at once..."


{T2C231}
[Sora]
At that moment, I would cease to exist.


17 :
After the discussion, I stayed in the rest
area alone.

It was a 'free time' of sorts.

I imagined that everyone was walking around
LeMU, spending the time as they pleased.

We had decided when and where we would meet.

I didn't know what I should do with myself
until then.

I was bored stiff.

I looked down.

The floor was covered with a layer of water.

The lights in the ceiling were reflected in
the water.

It was like the cold light of the moon.


I poked my finger into the water.

‡LPlop.

The water rippled, and the surface shook.

The light in the water fragmented into
disarray... finally returning to its original
shapes.

I reached into the water, trying to grab
the light.

But...

I could only grab a little seawater... I
couldn't touch the light.

I tried again and again, but no matter how
I tried, I couldn't grab the moon.

The words that I had just heard from Sora cut
across my mind again.


{T2C229}
[Sora]
"I mean that I cease to exist 
when no one is looking at me."

I lay down on the bench and closed my eyes.


18 :
I thought about Sora...

As I thought, my consciousness slipped into a
light sleep.

.........

......

...

It was actually more than a light sleep.

I continued my slumber.


19 :
When I opened my eyes, there was Sora.


20 :

{S2C116}
[Sora]
Kid-san, everyone is waiting for you.

Sora said it softly, peering down at me spread
out on the bench.

I was still half-asleep when Sora and I
started heading for the conference room
to meet everyone.


21 :
I thought as I walked the corridors in a
stupor.

I remembered the words that Sora had said
before I slept...

'I mean that I cease to exist 
when no one is looking at me.'

For some reason, I just couldn't shake those
words from my mind.

I asked Sora, walking next to me, why she had
said them.

And what she said was...
