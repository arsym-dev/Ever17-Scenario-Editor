1 :
In the infirmary...

Deciding to sleep was fine, but where?


There were four legitimate beds in the dry
areas.

There was one in the compression chamber along
with two beds and an examination table in the
infirmary.

Tsugumi was missing and Sora didn't need sleep,
so there were exactly four of us.

Takeshi had been relegated to the compression
chamber as a potential danger to the women.

Y¤u and Sara had said that they would take the
two beds since they were vulnerable young women.


So I... got stuck on the hard examination table.

{C2S251}
[Takeshi]
Hey... Kid...


{C2S252}
[Takeshi]
Kid...


3 :

{C2S253}
[Takeshi]
You asleep already?

Takeshi was shaking me.

[Kid]
"I'd wake up even if I were asleep with you 
shaking me that hard."


4 :

{C2S254}
[Takeshi]
So? Which is it? You awake or asleep?

[Kid]
Isn't it obvious?

[Kid]
I'm sleeping like a log...


5 :
I closed my eyes.


{C2S255}
[Takeshi]
Hey, come on, don't be like that.

[Kid]
...


{C2S256}
[Takeshi]
I can't sleep...


6 :
[Kid]
"Last night, you seemed like you were 
toootally fine."


{C2S257}
[Takeshi]
"But I'm all alone in this tiny little cramped 
space."


{C2S258}
[Takeshi]
"It's like being cooped up in a coffin. 
It makes me feel..."

[Kid]
"It's the same place you were snoring away 
last night!"

[Kid]
"You could sleep in a coffin. You could sleep 
in a cup of coffee."


7 :

{C2S259}
[Takeshi]
Hey, that almost rhymes or something...


8 :

{C2S260}
[Takeshi]
Coffin and coffee...


{C2S261}
[Takeshi]
"'Coffee has caffeine in it. That wakes 
you up.'"


{C2S262}
[Takeshi]
"'So there's no way a normal person could 
catch a wink in a cup of coffee...'"


{C2S263}
[Takeshi]
"'But... caffeine wouldn't faze a big lunk 
like that Takeshi. He'd sleep like a baby.'"


{C2S264}
[Takeshi]
"Is that what you are trying to say with that 
almost-rhyme of yours?"

[Kid]
Stupid.


9 :

{C2S265}
[Takeshi]
Ha! Is that any way to talk to your elders?

[Kid]
I'm going to sleep.


10 :

{C2S266}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Come on, K-I-D! Stay up with me a bit!

[Kid]
Good night.


11 :
I turned away from him.

Tug, tug, tug...


12 :
Thud.

Takeshi had pulled me off of the examination
table.


13 :
[Kid]
Hey, what are you doing!? I'll sue you!


14 :

{C2S267}
[Takeshi]
Come on, take it easy. Calm down...


{C2S268}
[Takeshi]
Let's have a drink. Y'know, man-to-man...

[Kid]
No thanks!


15 :

{C2S269}
[Takeshi]
My thoughts exactly!


{C2S270}
[Takeshi]
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuckity, yuck!


16 :

{C2S271}
[Takeshi]
I'm nothing without you, Kid!


17 :
And then...


18 :

{C2S272}
[Y¤u]
Be quiet!


{C2S273}
[Y¤u]
Cut it out, the two of you! Just go to sleep!

Y¤u, lying in the bed next to me, had snapped.


She sat upright, a strange light emanating
from her.


{C2S274}
[Takeshi]
Oh, sorry for causing such a ruckus, milady...


19 :
I walked out of the room with Takeshi's hand
pushing me from behind.


20 :

{C2S275}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, for now... why don't we hit the kiosk 
and get some beers?"


21 :
Takeshi started walking.

I stayed where I was.

[Kid]
Is there beer in LeMU?


{C2S276}
[Takeshi]
"Uh, I don't think it was for sale, but it was 
stashed in the back of the fridge."


{C2S277}
[Takeshi]
I figure some worker hid it in there...

[Kid]
But... I can't drink beer.


22 :

{C2S278}
[Takeshi]
Huh? Why not?

I stopped and turned around.

[Kid]
I'm not old enough.


{C2S279}
[Takeshi]
So what?

[Kid]
"Underage means you can't drink alcohol. It's 
the law."


23 :

{C2S280}
[Takeshi]
So you're saying you won't break any law?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...


{C2S281}
[Takeshi]
"But you ate sandwiches and drank cola, right? 
And you didn't pay anything."

[Kid]
That's... because I had to survive...


24 :

{C2S282}
[Takeshi]
Yuck, yuck... YUCK!


25 :

{C2S283}
[Takeshi]
"I bet you're the kind of kid that'll tattle 
on the kid next to you in class if he's 
passing notes to his friends."

[Kid]
I... I am not...


26 :

{C2S284}
[Takeshi]
"You don't know if you are or not, 'cause you've 
got no memory."

[Kid]
.........


27 :

{C2S285}
[Takeshi]
Oh, alright, alright.


{C2S286}
[Takeshi]
You can drink cream soda then.

[Kid]
Why cream soda?


28 :

{C2S287}
[Takeshi]
Because you're just a wittle baby!

[Kid]
I'm not a baby!

[Kid]
I'm sixteen...


29 :

{C2S288}
[Takeshi]
Ha, ha! Sixteen, huh?


{C2S289}
[Takeshi]
"Sixteen... Old enough to lead a whole gang of 
snot-nosed brats on your own."

[Kid]
Stop it.

[Kid]
"Sixteen is still underage, but I'm not a kid 
anymore."

[Kid]
"I'm still not an adult, but I'm not a kid 
anymore... That's what I am."


30 :

{C2S290}
[Takeshi]
Just WHAT about you is more than a kid?


{C2S291}
[Takeshi]
Kid...?

[Kid]
I'm... going back to bed.


31 :

{C2S292}
[Takeshi]
Liar, liar, pants on fire~


{C2S293}
[Takeshi]
"Right, right! Because you're a BIG boy... 
All grown up... Nya, nya, nya..."

[Kid]
.........


32 :

{C2S294}
[Takeshi]
What? Hey! Hold on a sec!


33 :

{C2S295}
[Takeshi]
Kid... You've got no memory, right?

[Kid]
R-right...


{C2S296}
[Takeshi]
So... how do you know that you're sixteen?

[Kid]
Because... Because...


34 :
[Kid]
I... I dunno... why...

As I mumbled, I unconsciously held open my right
hand.

I stared absently at my palm.

I still didn't have any idea what had happened
to my finger.

There was no doubt that I had said I was sixteen.

But I couldn't be sure I was right.


I wondered if I was really that age‡Lif I
could believe my words.


35 :

{C2S297}
[Takeshi]
Well, whatever.


{C2S298}
[Takeshi]
"Anyway, it's good that you remembered your 
age..."


{C2S299}
[Takeshi]
"Proof that you're slowly getting your 
memory back."

[Kid]
......


{C2S300}
[Takeshi]
Hmmmm, sixteen, huh?


36 :

{C2S301}
[Takeshi]
So my guess wasn't that far off, huh?

[Kid]
...Huh?


37 :

{C2S302}
[Takeshi]
"Yesterday I guessed, right? I said you were 
around fourteen or fifteen."


{C2S303}
[Takeshi]
"I suppose someone like you could be sixteen... 
Could be possible enough..."


38 :
(Could be...?)

(Could be? What's that supposed to mean?)

I looked at my arms, my legs, and my whole body
as if to check.

And lastly, I touched my hands to my face...


39 :

{C2S304}
[Takeshi]
What?


40 :

{C2S305}
[Takeshi]
Don't tell me you...


{C2S306}
[Takeshi]
You didn't forget your own face, did ya?

[Kid]
...Face...?


41 :
I put all my power into opening the door.

The room had a high ceiling... and I ran toward
the mirror on the room's far wall.


42 :
‡LBam!

My leg caught on the bench, and I crashed to
the floor.

I lifted my head slowly.

The mirror was right in front of me.

And I was inside it.

I looked at me.


43 :
For some reason, I felt scared all of a sudden.
I squeezed my eyes shut and looked down.


I willed my legs to stand me up.

My knees shook. I stumbled two or three steps.

I put my hand on the locker to keep myself
from falling. I tried to walk...

It was as if the mirror was sucking
me... toward it...

I put both hands on the mirror.


44 :
Both of my eyes were slightly open, but
I wasn't able to raise my face yet.

I was facing 'me', and both of us had our hands
facing each other.

I could only see his body.

His legs quivered. His palms shook, making the mirror
rattle.

I took a breath.


45 :
My shaking stopped.

At that moment, sound suddenly disappeared.

I didn't move.

The other 'me' didn't move either.

I waited for him to move.

I looked up ever so slightly.


46 :
I saw another world behind his back.

A bench lay knocked over... and clothing was
scattered everywhere...

Someone was standing on the other side of the
open door.


{C2S307}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid!


{C2S308}
[Takeshi]
What's up with you? Running off like that...


47 :
I turned around.

Takeshi stood with one hand on the door.


48 :

{C2S309}
[Takeshi]
...A mirror?


49 :
His voice made me want to look.

I turned my eyes around...

Inside the massive mirror...


50 :
The face of some kid who I didn't know was
staring back at me.

[Kid]
Ah... Aaaahh...

He screamed as if it were the end of the world.

His face contorted in a way that chilled my
spine. He clutched his hair with both hands.

His body shook, wracked with convulsions.


{C2S310}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what is it? What's going on!? Kid!

He put his fingernails on his cheek and
harshly scratched the flesh around his neck.
His lower jaw protruded forward, drooping downward
as his tongue hung out.

[Kid]
No... No... No...

[Kid]
"No... No... No... No... No... 
No... No... No... No..."


{C2S311}
[Takeshi]
What is it? What's wrong?

[Kid]
This... This... This...

[Kid]
It's not me...

[Kid]
It's not me...

[Kid]
It's not me!


{C2S312}
[Takeshi]
What's not you?

[Kid]
AAAaaah... Ohhhhhh...


{C2S313}
[Takeshi]
Damn... What am I supposed to do!?

[Kid]
No... No... No...

[Kid]
It's not me... It's not me... It's not me...


{C2S314}
[Takeshi]
J-just hold on, Kid!


{C2S315}
[Takeshi]
I'll go get everyone!

I didn't know who the 'me' inside the mirror was.


It wasn't the face of the Kid that I knew.

It wasn't the sick color of his skin, or his
bloodshot eyes, or the way his tongue hung
limply.

His whole appearance was completely different
than anything I had in my memory of myself.

He wasn't me.

No... I wasn't him.

Who was he...?

Who in the world was I...?

The 'me' that was standing there didn't
know who I was...

Where... was the real me...?

[Kid]
Who... are you?

I asked him, and he asked me.

[Kid]
Who... am I?

I asked me, and he asked he.


51 :
My consciousness was fading, and I gradually
started losing my senses.

52 :


{1}{1}{1}

{16:0x}Who... are you?{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}Who... am I?{16:1}

{16:4}

53 :
Someone whispered in my ear.

I didn't know if it was me or him...


54 :


{1}{1}{1}

{16:0x}Who... are you?{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}Who... am I?{16:1}

{16:4}

55 :
My eyes clouded over, and I couldn't see
clearly.

His body swung back and forth like a pendulum,
finally disappearing from my sight.


56 :
Drifting in pure white darkness.

But it wasn't me or him floating, but both
me and him.

I lost sight of where I ended and the world
began.

I had lost all sense of everything. I had no
way to confirm my existence.

I just let myself drift.

Like a baby floating in the womb...

Dissolving...

Dissolving... Dissolving... Dissolving...

I dissolved into pure white darkness, the pure
white darkness becoming me.

I was nowhere.

The me who was nowhere was everywhere.

So... where... was the real me...?


57 :


{1}{1}{1}

{16:0x}Who... are you?{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}Who... am I?{16:1}

{16:4}

58 :
And the whispering voice disappeared,
swallowed by the dark light.
