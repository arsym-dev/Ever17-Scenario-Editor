1 :
[Takeshi]
.........

The sound of boiling, bubbling oil filled the
room.

I fried the tuna in silence.

After getting up, we all gathered in front of
the sandwich shop as usual.

As luck would have it, everyone showed up at
the same time.

I guess I could have called it lucky...


2 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Kid]
.........


3 :
[Sora]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Pipi]
.........


4 :
Hardly anyone said a thing.

Everyone had glum expressions on their faces
and ate silently.

There was a strange atmosphere surrounding
us. For some reason, it had become hard for us
to look one another in the eyes.

It felt like the beginning of a bottomless
rift amongst us.

And at the same time, there was a strange
smell in the air...


5 :
Sizzle!

[Takeshi]
Aggghh!

There was smoke coming from the tip of my
finger!

[Takeshi]
Smoke! Smoke! Aaaggggh, that's hot...!

I had been firmly pressing it against the
grill.

I hastily cut the power.

A juicy smell, not unlike sausage, was coming
from the burnt tip of my finger.

[Takeshi]
Ooooooww, that hurts...

[Takeshi]
I'm such an idiot...

As I blew on my finger to cool it off, I
looked around at everyone.


6 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Kid]
.........


7 :
[Sora]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


8 :
They had noticed, but they all turned their
gazes down.


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whine*...

Only Pipi was kind enough to acknowledge me.

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, Pipi, I burnt myself pretty good, 
hahaha."

[Pipi]
.........

But soon, even Pipi turned his face away from
me.

[Takeshi]
Hey...

It seemed like everyone hated me. I felt
totally alone.

The sandwich I had just finished cooled off, and
soon it was no longer palatable.

It felt like the morning after a funeral.


9 :
Everyone knew why things had sunk so low.


Everyone knew, but nobody wanted to say
anything.

A moment of carelessness had opened our
hearts up to despair...

They shoveled the tuna sandwiches into
their mouths in silence.


10 :
After we were all finished eating, everyone
went to the conference room.


11 :

{T6A000}
[Sora]
"There is an important reason why I've called 
all of you here."


{T6A001}
[Sora]
"There is something that I wanted to inform 
you about as soon as possible."


{T6A002}
[Sora]
"I know it is difficult, but it is important 
for you to accurately realize the full gravity 
of this situation."


{T6A003}
[Sora]
"Please don't panic, settle down... and listen 
carefully."


12 :
Sora paused for a second.

Sora looked at all five of us in turn... Y¤u,
Tsugumi, £o¢o, the Kid, and me.

The conference room was silent.

But I could hear the sound of water coming
faintly from somewhere.

Was it water lapping in the hallways...?

Moments later, I couldn't hear it anymore.

As if Sora was waiting for that cue, she
slowly opened her mouth.


13 :

{T6A004}
[Sora]
The situation... is not good.


14 :
Sora extended her hand, and a holographic
window appeared in the space in front of us.

I felt like I hadn't seen her do that for a
while.


15 :

{T6A005}
[Sora]
"Currently, there are no areas that 
show signs of new flooding."


{T6A006}
[Sora]
"Since the flooding of the Cosmic Whale area 
in Dritter Stock last night, there have been 
no further reports of significant damage."


{T6A007}
[Sora]
"The burden being placed on LeMU's support 
columns has increased due to the flooding."


{T6A008}
[Sora]
"The structural distortion between floors is 
increasing."


{T6A009}
[Sora]
"If this continues, LeMU will eventually lose 
its equilibrium and tilt dramatically."


{T6A010}
[Sora]
"If the damage to the areas connecting the 
floors of different sectors increases, there 
is the possibility that pipe leaks could 
flood the dry sectors."


{T6A011}
[Sora]
"In other words... we can't afford to be 
careless. Things are critical."


16 :

{T6A012}
[Sora]
I think that I told you this before...


{T6A013}
[Sora]
"Implosion of LeMU is estimated to occur at 
4:30 a.m. on May 7th."


{T6A014}
[Sora]
"The calculation has a margin of error of plus 
or minus twelve hours."


{T6A015}
[Sora]
"There has been no significant change in this 
prediction."


{T6A016}
[Sora]
"In one area, the strength limits of 
partitions have already been exceeded."


{T6A017}
[Sora]
"The destruction of LeMU will be gradual, but 
it will inevitably and steadily occur."


{T6A018}
[Sora]
It is... only a matter of time.


17 :
Sora told all of us that with a calm look on
her face.

We all swallowed and held our breath as we
listened.

We knew we were reaching our time limit.

We had no choice but to accept that reality.

There was no avoiding the situation.


18 :

{T6A019}
[Sora]
"Presently, the power generator is functioning 
normally."


{T6A020}
[Sora]
"However, if by chance there is a 
blackout... we will switch to the emergency 
power source battery."


{T6A021}
[Sora]
"This is generally meant for supporting the 
emergency lighting and the maintenance on 
LeMU's system... It should last for about two 
hours."


19 :
However...

While I listened to Sora's report...


I couldn't help thinking about the two Soras from
the previous day‡Lthe real one and the fake.

How much of her thought processing had been
'repaired'?


20 :
Speaking in front of me was a Sora who was
practical, businesslike, and simply responding
to the situation at hand.

She looked at me as if nothing had
transpired, and I was of little importance to
her.

Which Sora was she? The real one or the fake
one...?

But...

I had other things to worry about.


21 :
Sora's matter-of-fact way of speaking only
raised the tension in our minds.

For Y¤u, £o¢o, Kid, Pipi...


22 :
...And even Tsugumi.

Everyone was listening calmly to what Sora
had to say. No one was panicking yet...

The previous night, Tsugumi's yells had pierced my
heart. Yet her bitter bullet didn't come out
my back, but remained lodged inside as a
constant reminder.


23 :
She refused to look at me.

Instead, Tsugumi just stared blankly in front
of her.

Perhaps that was for the best...

But...

I had other things to worry about.


24 :
I turned back to the situation at hand,
listening carefully to Sora's report.


25 :

{T6A022}
[Sora]
"The normal communication channels are still 
not functioning."


{T6A023}
[Sora]
Nor have I found an escape route.


{T6A024}
[Sora]
However...


{T6A025}
[Sora]
"I have made protecting you my top priority, 
and LeMMIH is devoting all of its resources 
to that objective."


26 :

{T6A026}
[Sora]
"I am also using all sensors, lights, 
manipulators, and means at my disposal outside 
of the complex..."


{T6A027}
[Sora]
"And I am still investigating whether there 
are any means of communicating with the 
outside using light, radio, or sound."


27 :
Sora nodded her head, straightened her back,
and surveyed the room. We were all silent.

There was a look of determination in her eyes.


28 :

{T6A028}
[Sora]
Let me say one thing more...


{T6A029}
[Sora]
That... as long as I, Akanegasaki Sora, exist...


{T6A030}
[Sora]
"And while my powers are limited, as long as 
you are here..."


{T6A031}
[Sora]
"I will do my utmost to find a way for you to 
escape to safety."


29 :

{T6A032}
[Sora]
"We do not have much longer together, but I, 
Akanegasaki Sora, am at your service."

She concluded with a serious nod.

We also nodded in agreement.


30 :

{T6A033}
[Sora]
"We must wait... and believe that help is on 
its way."

Sora's serious expression gave way to a smile.


{T6A034}
[Sora]
Everyone, let's pray for a safe rescue.


31 :
Her calmness was the result of her efficiently
functioning AI.

Thankfully, nobody panicked.

But...


32 :
Was that a genuine smile from Sora?

I was pretty sure it was.

Because if that was a fake smile...

No, even if it was Sora's real smile...

Thinking about it, it was kind of sad.


Not wanting anyone to realize my thoughts, I
bit my lip.


33 :
The gloomy atmosphere that had been hanging
over the gathering lightened, and everyone
started thinking about how they should spend
their time.


34 :
The gloomy atmosphere that had been hanging
over the gathering lightened, and everyone
started thinking about how they should spend
their time.

Sora's smile instilled everyone with courage.

I was grateful for that piece of code in
Sora's program, the function that allowed her
to be calm in times of trouble...


35 :
We transferred to the rest area.

Everyone found a seat around the central stage.

A ripple ran through the water on the floor.

A wave swashed back and forth from wall to
wall.

[Takeshi]
This is serious...

[Takeshi]
What are we going we do...?

I didn't have any ideas.

A few quiet discussions were going on.

Yet from where I stood, it seemed the more
people spoke, the murkier the answers became.

From the beginning, it was the same debate
repeated over and over again.

Should we wait for help?

Should we seek an escape route?

All I could do was look to the ceiling.

There was no sign that any bright ideas were
on their way to my head.

We were just waiting for the walls and
ceiling to come crumbling down.


36 :

{T6A035}
[Kid]
Ahhhh...!


{T6A036}
[Y¤u]
What happened, Kid?


37 :

{T6A037}
[Kid]
Everyone, be careful!


{T6A038}
[Kid]
Don't move! Don't stand up!


38 :
A deep moan rumbled through the room as the
floor began to shake.

A wave of fear ran through us.


39 :
Soon the shaking ceased.


40 :

{T6A039}
[Kid]
Y-Y¤u...


{T6A040}
[Y¤u]
Don't worry! It's okay.


{T6A041}
[Y¤u]
Right, Sora?


41 :

{T6A042}
[Sora]
Yes. The shaking just now was...


{T6A043}
[Sora]
"I believe it was only due to a large amount 
of activity from the thermal vents on the 
ocean floor. It should only be temporary."


42 :
[Kid]
.........

But her facial coloring still hadn't returned
to normal.


43 :
Everyone looked around the room, exchanging
glances.

And just like that, nervous tension filled
the room again.

[Takeshi]
Not again...

I decided to take charge.


44 :
[Takeshi]
Alright! Listen up, everyone!

I rose to my feet and shouted to everyone.


45 :
[Takeshi]
Listen, just stay where you all are!

[Takeshi]
"I'm going to check the kiosk on the second 
floor!"


46 :
Everyone looked shocked as I yelled.

Some jaws even dropped.


47 :
They may have been half put off by me.

Still, I didn't concern myself with that.


48 :
No matter how stupid it seemed, I continued...

[Takeshi]
"I'm going above to grab some snacks for 
everybody. There's plenty up there, and we 
should still be able to eat it."

[Takeshi]
"It'll be a pain to go get it later, and it 
doesn't make sense to let them go to waste."

[Takeshi]
Alright? We're going to eat here.

[Takeshi]
And let's have a good time...

[Takeshi]
Oh, that's right. Does anybody want beer...?


49 :

{T6A044}
[Y¤u]
What? B-but...

Y¤u raised her hand timidly.


{T6A045}
[Y¤u]
But we don't sell alcohol at the LeMU kiosks.


50 :

{T6A046}
[Y¤u]
"We've had a lot of complaints about customers 
having bad hangovers due to the difference 
in air pressure down here."

[Takeshi]
That's too bad.

[Takeshi]
"Well, hardly any of you look like you could 
hold your drink anyway. I guess it'll have to 
be juice..."


51 :

{T6A047}
[Kid]
Excuse me, Takeshi?

Next, it was the Kid who raised his hand.


52 :

{T6A048}
[Kid]
"There are probably plenty of drinks at the 
tuna sandwich shop. That way, you won't 
have to go above."


{T6A049}
[Kid]
"There's canned juice and paper cups... Why 
don't I go and get them?"

[Takeshi]
Alright, Kid, you do that.


53 :

{T6A050}
[Kid]
Alright. Leave it to me!

The Kid laughed. It seemed he was over the
events from the day before.


54 :

{T6A051}
[£o¢o]
Hey, let me help!

An excited £o¢o raised her hand, volunteering.


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


{T6A052}
[£o¢o]
I think Pipi wants to help too!

[Takeshi]
"Great! Alright, let's go and get the 
supplies."


55 :

{T6A053}
[Y¤u]
Sora, do we still have time?

Y¤u asked Sora this in a small voice.


{T6A054}
[Sora]
"I am sorry. I am not able to run an accurate 
simulation..."


{T6A055}
[Sora]
"There may not be much time, but we will be 
safe until 2 p.m. I can guarantee that."

Sora replied casually.


56 :

{T6A056}
[Y¤u]
Alright...


57 :
Y¤u nodded and looked up.


58 :

{T6A057}
[Y¤u]
"Kid, are you ready? Let's grab all the 
drinks we can carry."


{T6A058}
[Kid]
Okay, let's go.


59 :

{T6A059}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that's right!

Y¤u slammed her fist into her palm excitedly
and looked about the room.


60 :

{T6A060}
[Y¤u]
What about Tsugumi?


61 :

{T6A061}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi? H-huh...?


{T6A062}
[Y¤u]
She's not here...


62 :
[Takeshi]
What!?


63 :
I frantically surveyed the room as well, but
Tsugumi was nowhere in sight.

[Takeshi]
"Where the heck did she go? And when'd she 
leave?"


64 :

{T6A063}
[Sora]
"I believe Komachi-san slipped out of here just a 
short while ago."


{T6A064}
[Sora]
"She seems to have left for the second 
floor..."

[Takeshi]
.........


65 :

{T6A065}
[Y¤u]
There's nothing we can do.


66 :

{T6A066}
[Y¤u]
She'll be back soon, right, Kuranari?

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah...


67 :

{T6A067}
[Y¤u]
Okay, everyone, let's get ready to party!


68 :

{T6A068}
[£o¢o]
Okay!


{T6A069}
[Kid]
Alright!


{T6A070}
[Sora]
Yes!


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah!


{T6A071}
[£o¢o]
Let's party~ Party~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!

I had only thrown out the idea as a way to
lighten the mood...

And before I knew it, we had ourselves a
full-blown 'party' in the making.

...Well, whatever.

It was better than having everyone moping
around.


69 :
Soon, £o¢o, Pipi, and I left to get food. We
took the emergency stairs.


70 :

{T6A072}
[£o¢o]
Laaaalala... lalalala~


{T6A073}
[£o¢o]
Falalalala... lalalala~


{T6A074}
[£o¢o]
Falala... falala~


{T6A075}
[£o¢o]
LALALA~


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

As we climbed the stairs, £o¢o sang some
crazy song.

[Takeshi]
You seem like you're in a good mood, £o¢o.


71 :

{T6A076}
[£o¢o]
"Well, you know, I just get excited 
sometimes..."


72 :

{T6A077}
[£o¢o]
Looks like we've come to the climax!


73 :

{T6A078}
[£o¢o]
"The damsel in distress is in a pinch and in 
waltzes our dashing hero!"


74 :

{T6A079}
[£o¢o]
"Young lady, are you alright? Are you not 
injured?"


75 :

{T6A080}
[£o¢o]
"And there is our masked villain. I can't 
forgive you for this, you evil scoundrel!"


{T6A081}
[£o¢o]
"Using my neutrino energy power, I'll kill 
you! Ayah!"


76 :

{T6A082}
[£o¢o]
...Oh, I can pretend, can't I~

[Takeshi]
.........


77 :

{T6A083}
[£o¢o]
Huh, Takepyon? Are you fed up with me?

[Takeshi]
N-no...


78 :

{T6A084}
[£o¢o]
"You think I'm just a silly girl, don't you? 
Ah! So sad! But you want to see what kind of 
parents could have raised me."

[Takeshi]
No, no. It's not that... not at all!

I mussed up her hair affectionately.


79 :

{T6A085}
[£o¢o]
Heh heh heh...


80 :

{T6A086}
[£o¢o]
"If I were in a pinch like that, I'm sure 
someone would come to my rescue!"


{T6A087}
[£o¢o]
"I just can't help but think of how wonderful 
that would be..."


81 :

{T6A088}
[£o¢o]
"You know? What's wrong with dreaming like 
that?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, you're right.

[Takeshi]
"You know... To tell you the truth, I'm 
thinking the same way."

[Takeshi]
I think that someone might come to rescue us!

[Takeshi]
I don't know about the neutrino stuff though.


82 :

{T6A089}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, yeah! You're right~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


83 :
We wanted to believe that a hero was on the
way...

...And that went for £o¢o, Pipi, and me too.


84 :
We reached the second floor.

We turned down the corridor and entered the
souvenir shop.


85 :
Someone had beaten us there.


{T6A090}
[£o¢o]
Hey, is that you? Tsugumin?


86 :

{T6A091}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...

I was shocked to see her...

I totally blanked and went speechless.


{T6A092}
[Tsugumi]
Is there a reason I shouldn't be here?

Tsugumi spit out her words coldly.

It was the typical way she talked.


87 :

{T6A093}
[£o¢o]
No, not at all...


88 :

{T6A094}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin, how about you help us out?

[Tsugumi]
.........


89 :

{T6A095}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, alright. I don't suppose I really have 
a choice."

Tsugumi nodded reluctantly.


{T6A096}
[Tsugumi]
So what should I do, £o¢o?


90 :

{T6A097}
[£o¢o]
Well... Let's see...

[Takeshi]
.........


91 :
Tsugumi glanced at me...


92 :
She didn't say anything and looked away
quickly.

Her eyes seemed dead.

Thinking about it made me sad.


93 :

{T6A098}
[Tsugumi]
You're taking too long...

Tsugumi looked a little miffed.


94 :

{T6A099}
[Tsugumi]
Well, what is it you want me to carry?

[Takeshi]
.........


95 :

{T6A100}
[Tsugumi]
"What is it, Takeshi? You look like a pigeon 
caught in a shotgun blast."

[Takeshi]
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

I was surprised she even said anything to me.

[Takeshi]
Okay, let's get started!


96 :
One hour later‡L

We began our party in an elevated part of the
rest area.

Even without alcohol, the party was lively.

The Kid and I distributed the snacks and
drinks to everyone.

It was then that Y¤u volunteered to provide
some entertainment.

{16:4}

97 :
First, she performed an impersonation of a
strange old archaeologist who had a talent
for cracking a whip...

Then £o¢o came out in a makeshift sumo outfit
and stomped her feet on the stage...

Sora kept busy filling the room with hologram
projections of rainbows.

The rainbow-colored bubbles that floated from
the water surface through the air were
particularly pretty.

{16:4}

98 :
After that, Tsugumi joined us...

She added a little magic to the show as she
dropped her hamster in her skirt pocket only
to have it reappear in her breast pocket.

That really impressed the crowd.

Although I knew about her hamster, Chami, many
didn't even know Tsugumi kept a pet.

{16:4}

99 :
Then Kid and I performed a comedy skit.

We pulled out one-liners and impromptu gags
which got huge laughter from everyone.

{16:4}

100 :

{T6A101}
[Kid]
Thank you! Thank you very much!

[Takeshi]
Thanks!


101 :
Kid and I exited the stage to thunderous
applause.


102 :

{T6A102}
[£o¢o]
Hahahahaha~ That was great!


{T6A103}
[Y¤u]
That was absolutely wonderful!


103 :

{T6A104}
[Tsugumi]
Better than I expected...


{T6A105}
[Sora]
Those two were perfect together.

[Takeshi]
No, no, thank you, thank you...


{T6A106}
[Kid]
Thank you, thank you...


104 :
[Takeshi]
"Actually, I was surprised that you poked 
fun at yourself using the truth about you 
losing your memory as a gag."


105 :

{T6A107}
[Kid]
"Well, that's just how the skit flowed. It 
fit perfectly into our act."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I guess you're right...

[Takeshi]
"Well, it looks like I've got nothing more to 
teach you! So go ahead and follow in my 
comedy footsteps!"


106 :

{T6A108}
[Kid]
"Ah, sorry. I've already forgotten everything 
you taught me."

[Takeshi]
"Well, that's too bad... You should at least 
take notes. Notes!"

[Takeshi]
"But never fear! I ain't taught you nothin' 
yet!"


107 :

{T6A109}
[Kid]
Is that true?

And that was about it...


108 :
The party gradually wound down.


109 :
I then took a trip back to the tuna
sandwich stand and brought sandwiches back
for everyone.


110 :
We all munched on hot sandwiches.

(These... are so good!)

It wasn't exactly the ideal breakfast food.

Everyone happily downed their meals.


111 :
Food...

If LeMU collapsed soon...

I thought that could be everyone's last meal...


Everyone understood that, yet said nothing.

No...

Everyone understood, which was why they said
nothing.

.........

......


112 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi...

After finishing my sandwich, I got up the
nerve to speak to Tsugumi.


113 :

{T6A110}
[Tsugumi]
What?


{T6A111}
[Tsugumi]
What do you want, Takeshi...?


114 :
Tsugumi crouched on the stage.

I crouched beside her and looked to see what
she was doing.


115 :
There, Tsugumi was drawing something on the
stage with a thick marker.

As usual, Tsugumi didn't look at me.

[Takeshi]
Ah, well... It's...

She stopped scribbling for a moment. I
decided to come out and say what I had to say.

[Takeshi]
About yesterday...

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say, but...


116 :

{T6A112}
[Tsugumi]
What is it?


{T6A113}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't really know what you're talking 
about."

Tsugumi was curt in her response.

[Takeshi]
Tsu-Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
You're joking, right?

[Takeshi]
There's no way you could've forgotten.

[Takeshi]
I know I haven't.

[Takeshi]
"That's not something you can... just simply 
forget about."

[Takeshi]
"I realize it's not something you can talk 
about casually, but..."


117 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Her eyes wandered around the room for a moment.

Then she looked down again at the scribbles
she had been drawing.


118 :

{T6A114}
[Tsugumi]
I don't really care.


{T6A115}
[Tsugumi]
I don't care about what happened yesterday...


119 :

{T6A116}
[Tsugumi]
So, would you please stop talking about it?


{T6A117}
[Tsugumi]
Don't say anything.

[Takeshi]
.........

Tsugumi went back to her drawing on the stage
floor.


{T6A118}
[Tsugumi]
I...


120 :

{T6A119}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm trying to think of a way to get out of 
here too."


{T6A120}
[Tsugumi]
So don't... bother me.

[Takeshi]
.........

Tsugumi refused to look at me as she spoke.

After that, I felt a little put off.

[Takeshi]
Okay.


121 :
I stood up and left her there.

I walked over toward where Sora was.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora.


122 :

{T6A121}
[Sora]
Hello. What may I help you with, Kuranari-san?

Sora smiled softly when she looked at me.

[Takeshi]
Nothing much... I just have a lot on my mind.


123 :

{T6A122}
[Sora]
"Right now, LeMMIH is handling operations and 
will alert me if any troubles arise."


{T6A123}
[Sora]
"LeMMIH is also currently continuing 
investigation of means of escape as well as 
communication with the outside."


{T6A124}
[Sora]
Please do not worry.

[Takeshi]
Thanks, Sora... That helps.

[Takeshi]
"Can I ask what time it is? I need to set it 
on my..."


{T6A125}
[Sora]
No problem. The current time is‡L

[Takeshi]
Hold on for a second.

I took my PDA from my pocket.


124 :
[Takeshi]
Sora...

I made up my mind to speak to her about the
important things I had on my mind... right
after finishing my sandwich.


125 :

{T6A126}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it?

With a slight smile, Sora gazed at me.

Her eyes were like a clear, cloudless sky.

[Takeshi]
Ah, well, it's just that...

When I saw her smile, I wavered slightly.
Yet I continued to speak.

[Takeshi]
About yesterday...

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say, but...


126 :

{T6A127}
[Sora]
What is it?


{T6A128}
[Sora]
"I am not quite sure what you are talking 
about."

Sora spoke brusquely.

[Takeshi]
S-Sora!

[Takeshi]
You're joking, right?

[Takeshi]
There's no way you could've forgotten.

[Takeshi]
I know I haven't.

[Takeshi]
"That's not something you can... just simply 
forget about."

[Takeshi]
"I realize it's not something you can talk 
about casually, but..."


127 :

{T6A129}
[Sora]
Hahaha...

Sora gave me a bitter smile.


128 :

{T6A130}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry, Kuranari-san. I really do not remember 
the events of last night."

[Takeshi]
What?


{T6A131}
[Sora]
I... do not remember.


{T6A132}
[Sora]
I am sorry.


{T6A133}
[Sora]
"I forgot them. There is a gap in my memory 
of a few hours."

[Takeshi]
How... Why?

[Takeshi]
You're lying... You've got to be...

I didn't want to believe it.


129 :

{T6A134}
[Sora]
Listen, Kuranari-san. I...

She laughed again and gazed out at the others
around the stage.


{T6A135}
[Sora]
I love this.


{T6A136}
[Sora]
"Seeing the people around me laugh... I love 
that."


130 :

{T6A137}
[Sora]
"Right now, LeMMIH is handling operations and 
will alert me if any troubles arise."


{T6A138}
[Sora]
"I have been hoping that no trouble befalls 
us..."


{T6A139}
[Sora]
It is my duty to watch over you all.


{T6A140}
[Sora]
"When people return a smile, it warms my 
heart..."


{T6A141}
[Sora]
And for that very reason...


{T6A142}
[Sora]
That is why I am always able to laugh.


{T6A143}
[Sora]
That was how my creator made me...

[Takeshi]
.........

I didn't want her to talk about herself as
something 'made' or how she was
'manufactured'.


131 :

{T6A144}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, please do not look at me as if you 
are going to cry."

[Takeshi]
Yeah, right... Fine.

I wanted to kick myself for what I'd done the
previous night.

But it was too late to take it back...


132 :
Just then...


133 :

{T6A145}
[Tsugumi]
Excuse me, Sora?


{T6A146}
[Sora]
Ah yes, Komachi-san... What is on your mind?

Tsugumi was suddenly standing right between
Sora and me.

Her smile seemed just a little forced.


134 :

{T6A147}
[Tsugumi]
"There's something I want to talk with you 
about. Alone..."


135 :

{T6A148}
[Sora]
In private?


{T6A149}
[Tsugumi]
Yes... please.


136 :

{T6A150}
[Tsugumi]
"Actually, I have a proposal, an idea of how to 
escape from here."


137 :

{T6A151}
[Sora]
"Yes, really? Have you come up with a good 
method?"


{T6A152}
[Tsugumi]
Yes. I might be able to help in some way.


{T6A153}
[Tsugumi]
"I want to hear from you whether or not my 
idea is feasible."

[Takeshi]
Huh...? Hey, Tsugumi, hold on. Sora is...


138 :

{T6A154}
[Tsugumi]
Shut up, Takeshi.

Tsugumi held out her hand as if stopping my
mouth in one motion.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A155}
[Tsugumi]
I want to speak to Sora. Alone.


139 :

{T6A156}
[Tsugumi]
Surely you don't mind?


{T6A157}
[Sora]
"...Of course. Then we will speak in the 
central control room."


{T6A158}
[Tsugumi]
Alright. Let's go then.


140 :
The two got down from the stage and set off
with very serious looks on their faces.

[Takeshi]
Hey, wait, you two! What about us!?

[Takeshi]
Why can't you just talk here!?


141 :

{T6A159}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...!

Tsugumi turned around and shot a sharp glare
at me.

Her eyes were like ice.


142 :

{T6A160}
[Tsugumi]
I told you to shut up, didn't I?

[Takeshi]
.........


143 :
Sora and Tsugumi turned their backs to me and
left together.


144 :
The room suddenly fell silent.

[Takeshi]
What the hell.

[Takeshi]
What the hell is going on here...?

I felt alone. Balling up the sandwich
wrapper, I threw it as hard as I could.


145 :
Splash.

The wrapper fell in the water, creating a
series of ripples.


146 :

{T6A161}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari... What do you think you're doing?


{T6A162}
[Y¤u]
You shouldn't litter, you know?

Y¤u picked the wrapper out of the water and
twisted it around her finger.

[Takeshi]
"Wh-who cares? It doesn't matter at this point 
anyway..."


147 :

{T6A163}
[Y¤u]
Oh, not that again. Quit your sulking, pal!

[Takeshi]
I'm not sulking.


{T6A164}
[Y¤u]
If you saaay so...

Y¤u shrugged and let out a deep sigh.


148 :

{T6A165}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*...


149 :

{T6A166}
[Y¤u]
Alright!

I glanced over to the corner of the room and
saw £o¢o and Kid climbing a statue.

Looking over at them...

Y¤u and I sat down on the circular stage.


150 :

{T6A167}
[Y¤u]
The reason is totally obvious.


{T6A168}
[Y¤u]
You don't have to say anything.


{T6A169}
[Y¤u]
"Even if you look fine, I know it's just for 
show."


{T6A170}
[Y¤u]
I know you're depressed, Kuranari.

[Takeshi]
"W-well, because! I mean, i-it isn't like that 
at all...!"


151 :

{T6A171}
[Y¤u]
What's this 'because'?


{T6A172}
[Y¤u]
"Obviously, you're hiding something. You said 
'because'."


{T6A173}
[Y¤u]
That's a little strange, don't you think?


152 :

{T6A174}
[Y¤u]
Come on, try to prove me wrong.

[Takeshi]
.........

I was pretending I was fine.

Even I knew the reason was obvious.

I was worried about 'her'...


153 :

{T6A175}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*...

Y¤u let out another fake sigh again.


154 :

{T6A176}
[Y¤u]
"Well, if you're not going to tell me, do you 
mind if I ask a question?"

[Takeshi]
Go ahead...

[Takeshi]
As you wish...

[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...

That time, I was the one to sigh.


155 :

{T6A177}
[Y¤u]
Okay! Here I go!

[Takeshi]
Well, hurry up already.


156 :

{T6A178}
[Y¤u]
What are you so angry about?

[Takeshi]
I'm not angry about anything.


157 :

{T6A179}
[Y¤u]
Okay, okay...


158 :
The Kid and Pipi were playing sumo. £o¢o was
the referee.

I was watching them...

...As Y¤u spoke.


159 :

{T6A180}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari...


{T6A181}
[Y¤u]
"Do you know about the malfunction in Sora's 
thought process?"

[Takeshi]
I don't know.

[Takeshi]
No, wait, maybe I do know.


{T6A182}
[Y¤u]
Well, which one is it?

[Takeshi]
I can't say either way.


{T6A183}
[Y¤u]
"Ah, so you're one of those indecisive types, 
huh?"

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright...

[Takeshi]
But I can't talk about it.

[Takeshi]
It's a secret between Sora and me.

It was likely that Sora was jealous of
Tsugumi and me.

But I was pretty sure AI didn't understand
emotions like jealousy.

Always bothered by emotions that she didn't
understand. Sora...

Asking me to explain them to her. Sora...

Sharp twinges nagged at my heart.


{T6A184}
[Y¤u]
Oh really? I see. It's a secret, huh?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A185}
[Y¤u]
By the way...


{T6A186}
[Y¤u]
"When I was searching through LeMMIH, I found 
out..."


{T6A187}
[Y¤u]
"One feature of Sora's system is the ability 
to engage in self-study, but she's unable to 
manipulate memories."

[Takeshi]
...What?

[Takeshi]
What did you just say?


{T6A188}
[Y¤u]
"She's able to store information she accumulates 
through self-study."

[Takeshi]
No, the part after that...


{T6A189}
[Y¤u]
"She isn't able to manipulate or delete 
memories... by herself. The only thing that 
can change is the priority she puts on 
information in her database."


{T6A190}
[Y¤u]
"The only way to perform a system recovery is 
when the system crashes. As a last resort..."


{T6A191}
[Y¤u]
"And only humans approved by the system can 
restart her."

[Takeshi]
.........

Meaning that she couldn't have undergone a
system recovery the previous night.

Sora...

She told me the truth.

But at the same time, she lied.

A computer program that could only accept
'yes' or 'no', 'ones' and 'zeroes', had tried
desperately to accept a contradiction...


{T6A192}
[Y¤u]
In a sense, AI is similar to people.


{T6A193}
[Y¤u]
"It can pretend that it didn't notice 
something, but it's not easy for it to forget 
things..."

[Takeshi]
Why are you telling me this?


{T6A194}
[Y¤u]
I wonder?

Y¤u said that sarcastically, playing dumb.

Then she laughed mischievously.

[Takeshi]
Listen... Y¤u...


{T6A195}
[Y¤u]
Whaaat?

[Takeshi]
"Even if Sora's memory was being stored 
somewhere above us, do you think she really 
wants to be rescued with the rest of us?"


{T6A196}
[Y¤u]
What do you think, Kuranari?

[Takeshi]
"Of course I... I want her to be saved along 
with everyone else."

[Takeshi]
"LeMU is Sora's eyes, her body. Even if her 
mind is in another section, if this part 
sinks, part of her will go down with it."

[Takeshi]
"And if that's the case, no matter what we 
do, there's no way to rescue her from here 
completely..."


{T6A197}
[Y¤u]
"Yeah. I really hope that we can all escape 
together."

[Takeshi]
"It sure would be nice for that wish to come 
true..."


{T6A198}
[Y¤u]
Yeah... It would.

£o¢o and Pipi...

I could hear splashes as they ran.


{T6A199}
[Y¤u]
"Actually, a close friend of mine told me 
this once, but..."


{T6A200}
[Y¤u]
Believe it, desire it, and it can come true...

[Takeshi]
Believe it, desire it, and it can...?

[Takeshi]
What is that, something you read in a book?


{T6A201}
[Y¤u]
Well... not exactly.


{T6A202}
[Y¤u]
"It's a sort of phenomenon. I don't know if 
it's true or not. It's just a kind of 
hypothesis."

[Takeshi]
Hypothesis?


{T6A203}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


{T6A204}
[Y¤u]
It's called...


{T6A205}
[Y¤u]
Curé.

[Takeshi]
Curé?

Curé...

I pondered the word for a moment.


160 :

{T6A206}
[Y¤u]
Hey... Kuranari...


{T6A207}
[Y¤u]
About Tsugumi's injury...


{T6A208}
[Y¤u]
It's healing really quickly...


{T6A209}
[Y¤u]
She didn't even need stitches, you know.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A210}
[Y¤u]
"Tsugumi seems like she leads a normal life, 
just like you and me..."


{T6A211}
[Y¤u]
"And I try not to worry too much about her 
and just accept things as I see them, but..."


{T6A212}
[Y¤u]
But that just isn't normal.

She looked down at her feet when she spoke.


{T6A213}
[Y¤u]
Have you heard about Tsugumi's condition?

[Takeshi]
No, I haven't...

[Takeshi]
Wait, I might have.


{T6A214}
[Y¤u]
You can really be vague sometimes, you know?


{T6A215}
[Y¤u]
Which one is it?

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry... I forgot.


{T6A216}
[Y¤u]
You forgot!?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A217}
[Y¤u]
"So you're one of those indecisive type of 
guys, hmmm?"

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A218}
[Y¤u]
Come on! Say something...

I was silent.

I figured it was something just between
Tsugumi and me.

And...

I didn't really know enough about her
condition to say, 'Yeah, I know something.'

I was still having a difficult time
believing the whole thing.

Even when I saw it with my own eyes, part of
my brain refused to accept it.


{T6A219}
[Y¤u]
Let's just drop it...


{T6A220}
[Y¤u]
Haha. You really forgot, didn't you?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A221}
[Y¤u]
"Well, I guess there's nothing we can do about 
it."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
How come you asked me about it?


{T6A222}
[Y¤u]
I wonder why?

Y¤u said that sarcastically, playing dumb.

And then a serious look formed on her face.


{T6A223}
[Y¤u]
The truth is...


{T6A224}
[Y¤u]
"When I was looking at LeMMIH, I came upon 
some interesting information in the medical 
database."


{T6A225}
[Y¤u]
"It was from the Leiblich Pharmaceuticals 
database..."

[Takeshi]
Leiblich Pharmaceuticals?

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
Database?


{T6A226}
[Y¤u]
"I think they use it during treatment in the 
infirmary, but..."

£o¢o and Pipi...

I could hear the splashes from their running
echo.


{T6A227}
[Y¤u]
"When I scoured the database... I couldn't 
believe what I read."


{T6A228}
[Y¤u]
A body that doesn't grow old...


{T6A229}
[Y¤u]
A mutated body type because of a virus...


{T6A230}
[Y¤u]
"It shakes the foundations of modern 
science..."

[Takeshi]
.........


{T6A231}
[Y¤u]
"I might have found something related to 
Tsugumi's condition."


{T6A232}
[Y¤u]
"In the database, I searched through a number 
of old medical records."


{T6A233}
[Y¤u]
I found one that mirrors Tsugumi's condition.


{T6A234}
[Y¤u]
"Generally speaking, the number of known cases of 
this virus is very small.."

[Takeshi]
What...?

[Takeshi]
Hey, hey, hold on.

[Takeshi]
How come LeMU has that kind of information?


{T6A235}
[Y¤u]
I don't know! Why ask me?


{T6A236}
[Y¤u]
"All I know is that data and the name of 
the virus."

[Takeshi]
The name of the... virus?


{T6A237}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, the name...


{T6A238}
[Y¤u]
It's called...


{T6A239}
[Y¤u]
Curé.

[Takeshi]
Curé?

Curé.

I pondered the word for a moment.


161 :
Just then...


{T6A240}
[Kid]
Everyone! We've got trouble!


162 :
The Kid came running into the room, yelling.


163 :
[Takeshi]
Kid? Where the heck did you just go?


{T6A241}
[Y¤u]
Trouble? What kind of trouble?


164 :

{T6A242}
[Kid]
C-come on! We've gotta go and stop it!

The Kid was breathing heavily, yelling between
breaths.

[Takeshi]
Stop what? Hey, explain what's going on.


{T6A243}
[£o¢o]
Wh-what happened?


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

£o¢o and Pipi came over to see what all the
commotion was about.


165 :

{T6A244}
[Kid]
The central control room...!


{T6A245}
[Kid]
"Sora and Tsugumi were gone for such a long 
time, I..."


{T6A246}
[Kid]
I went to go find them...


{T6A247}
[Kid]
And I found them fighting!

[Takeshi]
!


{T6A248}
[Kid]
I just couldn't watch, so I...


{T6A249}
[Y¤u]
This is bad news... at a time like this.


{T6A250}
[£o¢o]
L-let's go! We've got to stop them!

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah! We'd better hurry!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Bow-wow*!


166 :
The Kid, £o¢o, Pipi, Y¤u, and I...

We sped along the wet floor to the central
control room.


167 :

{T6A251}
[Y¤u]
Sora!


{T6A252}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin!

I pushed the button to open the door.


168 :

{T6A253}
[Tsugumi]
...!


{T6A254}
[Sora]
...!


169 :
We burst into the room...


170 :
Tsugumi and Sora were in the middle of an
argument so intense that it seemed they might
start going at it hand-to-hand.

Neither one would budge. They just glared
at one another.

It looked as though they had been fighting
for several minutes. The room was filled with
tension.


{T6A255}
[Sora]
Beneath us?


{T6A256}
[Sora]
"There aren't any floors underneath Dritter 
Stock. We can't go down any farther."


171 :

{T6A257}
[Tsugumi]
Liar...


{T6A258}
[Tsugumi]
You're lying.


{T6A259}
[Tsugumi]
"I saw down from Qualle, and borrowing your 
eyes, I was able to access LeMMIH. It took a 
while, though..."


172 :

{T6A260}
[Tsugumi]
I finally got proof. There is another floor under LeMU.


{T6A261}
[Tsugumi]
"No, there's another facility other than 
LeMU... and it's right below us. Really far 
down."


{T6A262}
[Tsugumi]
I'm right, aren't I?


173 :
[Sora]
..........


174 :

{T6A263}
[Sora]
I can't answer that question...


175 :

{T6A264}
[Tsugumi]
Don't tell me that, just answer me!


{T6A265}
[Tsugumi]
"I did a Turing test, and I found out that 
you really are AI."


176 :

{T6A266}
[Tsugumi]
"As long as you aren't blocked by a protection 
routine, you have to answer humans honestly, right?"


{T6A267}
[Tsugumi]
That's part of your functioning.


177 :
[Sora]
.........


{T6A268}
[Tsugumi]
"It isn't possible to get there using normal 
elevators."


{T6A269}
[Tsugumi]
The only way there is through a locked door.


178 :

{T6A270}
[Tsugumi]
That room...


{T6A271}
[Tsugumi]
HIMMEL... That's your name, isn't it, Sora?

[Sora]
.........


179 :

{T6A272}
[Tsugumi]
"We aren't getting anywhere just sitting 
around."


180 :

{T6A273}
[Tsugumi]
We're fighting against time!


{T6A274}
[Tsugumi]
The truth is behind that door.


{T6A275}
[Tsugumi]
"Tell us the password to that door... the one 
leading to Himmel, Sora!"


{T6A276}
[Sora]
It is true...


{T6A277}
[Sora]
'Himmel' in German... means 'sky'‡Lmy name.


{T6A278}
[Sora]
But, Komachi-san, I...


{T6A279}
[Sora]
"I don't have the security access to open 
that door."


{T6A280}
[Sora]
I'm sorry...


181 :

{T6A281}
[Tsugumi]
That's a lie!


182 :

{T6A282}
[Sora]
It is not!


183 :

{T6A283}
[Tsugumi]
"Some AI you are! You think I'm stupid? You 
think you can fool me?"


{T6A284}
[Sora]
It is not a lie! I am telling the truth!


{T6A285}
[Sora]
"I don't have any information of what's 
behind that door..."


184 :

{T6A286}
[£o¢o]
Stop it!


185 :
£o¢o jumped between them.


186 :

{T6A287}
[£o¢o]
Stop it, both of you!


187 :
Both of them flinched for a moment but
continued to look bitter.


188 :

{T6A288}
[Sora]
£o¢o-chan...


{T6A289}
[Tsugumi]
£o¢o...


189 :

{T6A290}
[£o¢o]
Stop it... okay? Please!


190 :

{T6A291}
[Sora]
£o¢o-chan, this is between Komachi-san and I.


{T6A292}
[Tsugumi]
"Get back, £o¢o... or I'm really going to get 
mad."


{T6A293}
[£o¢o]
Why?


{T6A294}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin, Sora-san, stop it!


{T6A295}
[£o¢o]
Why are you arguing?


{T6A296}
[Sora]
This isn't an argument.


{T6A297}
[Tsugumi]
We aren't.


191 :

{T6A298}
[£o¢o]
You're lying... It's a lie...!


192 :

{T6A299}
[£o¢o]
We shouldn't be fighting...!

Large tears welled and flowed from £o¢o's eyes.


193 :
[Sora]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

The tears had a freezing effect on Sora and
Tsugumi.


194 :

{T6A300}
[£o¢o]
Agh...


{T6A301}
[£o¢o]
Aaaghh...


{T6A302}
[£o¢o]
Waagghh...


195 :
£o¢o started gasping.

She suddenly ran to the corner of the console.


196 :
Or rather... fell there.

She leaned against the console, barely able
to support herself.

£o¢o's body was shaking slightly.

Her lips trembled.

I could see that her lips had rapidly gone pale.


It was different than crying...

[Takeshi]
£o¢o...

[Takeshi]
H-hey, what...?

[Takeshi]
What's up with you all of a sudden...?


197 :

{T6A303}
[£o¢o]
Agh...!

198 :



199 :
£o¢o's lips were suddenly... stained red.


{T6A304}
[Kid]
£o¢o!

The Kid opened his eyes wide, looking shocked.


200 :

{T6A305}
[£o¢o]
Agh... Ah... Uugh...


{T6A306}
[£o¢o]
Uggh... Aaaah... Aaaahhh...


{T6A307}
[£o¢o]
Nnn... Uuuh... Uuugh...


{T6A308}
[Y¤u]
£o¢o!

Blood was flowing onto the floor of the
control room.

It wouldn't stop.

It kept falling from her mouth.


{T6A309}
[Tsugumi]
What's happening!?


{T6A310}
[Sora]
£o¢o-chan!

£o¢o shook her head and trembled violently.


She had her hand to her mouth, desperately
trying not to cough.


{T6A311}
[Sora]
It can't be...!


{T6A312}
[Sora]
These... These symptoms are...!

Sora looked as if she was about to panic.


{T6A313}
[Tsugumi]
Symptoms!? Who cares about symptoms!?

Tsugumi screamed furiously.


{T6A314}
[Tsugumi]
"Can't you tell!? If this keeps up, £o¢o's 
going to...!"


{T6A315}
[Kid]
£o¢o, hang in there!


{T6A316}
[Y¤u]
Ku-Kuranari... what are we going to do!?

[Takeshi]
Wait! Don't panic! Everyone just calm down!

I screamed out in a loud voice to everyone.

[Takeshi]
Calm down, calm down!

[Takeshi]
Oh, wait... Maybe I need to calm down too...

[Takeshi]
Whew...

Everyone took deep breaths, trying to settle
down.

[Takeshi]
£o¢o, just relax. You're going to be okay...


{T6A317}
[£o¢o]
Ugh...


{T6A318}
[£o¢o]
I'm... al... right... Take... pyon.

Steadying her trembling eyes, £o¢o looked at
me firmly.

[Takeshi]
Alright, okay. Good girl...

[Takeshi]
Now hang onto me, £o¢o!

I turned around and thrust out my back toward
her.

[Takeshi]
Can you get on?


{T6A319}
[£o¢o]
Ye... Yeah.


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whine*...

Pipi looked up at £o¢o worriedly.

[Takeshi]
We're going to the infirmary on Zweiter.


{T6A320}
[Y¤u]
O-okay!


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof*!

I realized that I was holding onto £o¢o.


201 :
We were rushing up to Zweiter Stock, some
seventeen meters above us.

I held £o¢o on my back, with Y¤u and Tsugumi
supporting her from the sides.

Sora led the way, and the Kid brought
up the rear.


202 :
We emerged at the second floor
emergency corridor.

[Takeshi]
Which way is it, left or right!?


203 :

{T6A321}
[Sora]
Straight ahead!

[Takeshi]
Okay!


204 :

{T6A322}
[Tsugumi]
Don't run so fast! Stop shaking her so much!

[Takeshi]
I know! Just pipe down, would you!?


205 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


206 :
£o¢o was groaning in pain on my back.

But I could still make it.

There was no way I was going to fail.

I wasn't going to say, 'It's no use, we're too
late', and I wasn't going to let anyone else
say it either.

As long as there was some hope left, I
wouldn't give up.


207 :
I took a shortcut to the nearest elevator
and rushed £o¢o to the infirmary.
