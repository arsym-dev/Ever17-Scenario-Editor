{C5A452}
[£o¢o]
Hey! Hey, Whale-san, Whale-san?


{C5A453}
[£o¢o]
What time is it?


{C5A454}
[£o¢o]
A whale of a time~


2 :

{C5A455}
[£o¢o]
Neeheehahahaha~

[Takeshi]
Y-you...

[Takeshi]
"You better not have asked me to come all 
this way just to tell me that stupid joke."

(And it's only 8 a.m. in the morning...)


3 :

{C5A456}
[£o¢o]
No.


{C5A457}
[£o¢o]
I just wanted to go on a date with you and...

[Takeshi]
D-date?


{C5A458}
[£o¢o]
Yeah.


{C5A459}
[£o¢o]
Well, Takepyon, you like me, right?


{C5A460}
[£o¢o]
So that means we're going out...


{C5A461}
[£o¢o]
"When a boyfriend and girlfriend tell each 
other their true feelings, everyone knows 
it's best to be under a starlit sky..."


{C5A462}
[£o¢o]
That's why I brought you here! To Whale-san...

[Takeshi]
.........


4 :

{C5A463}
[£o¢o]
Actually, I'm just teasing you~

[Takeshi]
?


5 :

{C5A464}
[£o¢o]
You're already married, right, Takepyon?

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C5A465}
[£o¢o]
Don't be shyyyy~


{C5A466}
[£o¢o]
"I know eeeeeverything there is to know about 
you."


{C5A467}
[£o¢o]
"And not only just you. I know everything 
there is to know about eeeverything~"

[Takeshi]
Everything?


{C5A468}
[£o¢o]
Well, yeah?


{C5A469}
[£o¢o]
Of course. I'm a psychic.

[Takeshi]
...


{C5A470}
[£o¢o]
"For as long as I can remember, I've been 
able to talk with people from different 
worlds."

[Takeshi]
Different worlds meaning... the other side?


{C5A471}
[£o¢o]
Ummm...


{C5A472}
[£o¢o]
"No, not like that, just another world that 
isn't this one."

[Takeshi]
Aaahhh...


{C5A473}
[£o¢o]
"If I borrow the sight from the people in the 
other world, I can see everything from the 
past and future."

[Takeshi]
Oh really. Wooow...


{C5A474}
[£o¢o]
"Like, the people in the second dimension, they 
can't really see the whole world, right?"

[Takeshi]
?


{C5A475}
[£o¢o]
"You can't see those huge line drawings at 
Nazca, Peru, from the ground, right?"


{C5A476}
[£o¢o]
"And let's say you have a really cool drawing 
of a robot on your computer display. One of 
the dots on the screen, they can't see the 
whole drawing..."

[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah...?


{C5A477}
[£o¢o]
So what can they do to see the whole picture?


{C5A478}
[£o¢o]
"Well, for the pictures at Nazca, all you have 
to do is go up in the air and look down..."


{C5A479}
[£o¢o]
"And for the picture on the display? If you 
can get a little bit away from the screen, 
into the third dimension, you could see it, 
right?"

[Takeshi]
.........


{C5A480}
[£o¢o]
We're in the third dimension, right?


{C5A481}
[£o¢o]
"Only the third dimension keeps moving on 
forward in time."


{C5A482}
[£o¢o]
"So, in order to see it moving, you can't just 
stay in the third dimension."


{C5A483}
[£o¢o]
"You'd have to look down at everything from 
the fourth dimension."

(Come to think of it, didn't Sora mention
something like this...?)


{C5A484}
[£o¢o]
"But I'm human, and I can't get out of the 
flow of time..."


{C5A485}
[£o¢o]
"So I just borrow the viewpoint of the people 
from the fourth dimension."

[Takeshi]
"Then what you're trying to say is that the 
people from the other side are really 
people from the fourth dimension?"


6 :

{C5A486}
[£o¢o]
Yep~

[Takeshi]
That's the dumbest thing I've ever...


{C5A487}
[£o¢o]
Well, I caaan.


{C5A488}
[£o¢o]
I really caaaan!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C5A489}
[£o¢o]
I really, really can...


7 :

{C5A490}
[£o¢o]
...Great, huh?

[Kid]
It's the third eye...


{C5A491}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, you could call it that too.

[Kid]
Then you can tell everything about my past...


{C5A492}
[£o¢o]
"Umm, well, I don't really think I can help 
you, Hokutan."

[Kid]
Eh?


{C5A493}
[£o¢o]
Because you aren't really Hokutan, right?

[Kid]
.........


{C5A494}
[£o¢o]
"So you aren't borrowing anyone's perspective, 
I think."


{C5A495}
[£o¢o]
"In your case, Hokutan, I'm pretty sure you're 
just... 'perspective' itself, right?"

[Kid]
What do you mean?


8 :

{C5A496}
[£o¢o]
Blick Winkel-san.

[Kid]
...What?


{C5A497}
[£o¢o]
"I'm pretty sure Blick Winkel-san knows 
everything."

[Kid]
Blick... Winkel...

‡LJust then!


9 :
‡LKa-ka-ka-ka-KABOOOM!

A massive boom rocked our eardrums.

We all reflexively looked up.

The ceiling of our world, the cosmos, had
shattered...


10 :
Immediately, a large amount of seawater rained
down on us like an avalanche.

Shards from the shattered wall cracked off
and shot into the floor like bullets.


11 :
I looked back, but £o¢o was gone.

[Kid]
£o¢o!

Nobody was there to respond.

All the sound was drowned out from the water
rushing in, such that we could hardly even hear
our own voices.

Droplets of water were falling from
above... White mist was rising from below...

The water level was rising quickly.

An incoming jet of water from the ceiling
struck the whale, which was suspended in the
center of the room. It bent backward hard,
fell, and lay on the floor.

Its big mouth flapped open, its pupils empty.


The whale was dead...

I turned around, cutting through the water,
and fled from the room.


12 :
The door to the Cosmic Whale room closed with a
gurgling sound.


{C5A498}
[Sara]
Onii-chan! Are you okay!?


13 :
I spun around, drawn by Sara's voice.

She was standing there, shoulders heaving.


{C5A499}
[Sara]
"I ran here as soon as the alarm sounded, 
but..."

Looking over Sara's shoulder... I could see
people running toward us from the corridor.

I returned my gaze to the door. It didn't
appear to be leaking.

The Cosmic Whale room was flooded, but it looked
as though the other areas were safe. For the time
being.

14 :

{C5A500}
[Sara]
Hey, onii-chan...

[Kid]
?


{C5A501}
[Sara]
Blood.

[Kid]
Eh?


{C5A502}
[Sara]
You're bleeding.

Sara pointed to my left hand.

I looked at my palm.

Where had I gotten a cut?

Had a shard slashed me when it fell, and I just
hadn't noticed?

Or had I snagged it on something when I was
trying to get out of the door?

At any rate, bright red blood was dripping
from the side of my hand.


{C5A503}
[Sara]
You okay?

Sara took a white handkerchief from her
pocket and took my injured hand in hers,
binding the wound.


{C5A504}
[Sara]
Does it hurt?

I shook my head.

The truth was, I didn't feel anything.

More important... than the scratch on my hand...

[Kid]
Blick... Winkel...


15 :

{C5A505}
[Sara]
Eh?

Sara tilted her head questioningly.

More than the injury, more than the flooding,
more than anything, £o¢o's words were running
through my head.


16 :

{C5A496}
[£o¢o]
Blick Winkel-san.

'Blick Winkel'.

'Blick... Winkel...'

[Kid]
Who... are you?

[Kid]
Who... am I?

Again...

I could hear that voice again.

Was it my voice? Or someone else's?


I kept staring at the palm of my left hand.

A red stain spread slowly across the white
fabric.

[Kid]
Who... are you?

[Kid]
Who... am I?


{C5A493}
[£o¢o]
Because you aren't really Hokutan, right?


{C5A497}
[£o¢o]
"I'm pretty sure Blick Winkel-san knows 
everything."

'Blick Winkel'.

'Blick... Winkel...'

Blood...

The wet, crimson stain spread...

And blood fell in thick droplets...

Landing in the puddles at my feet.

It spread out in the water like smoke, to
eventually dissolve into the seawater.

Just then‡L


17 :
‡LMy vision grew red.


18 :
I could see it.

I could see everything.

Everything in the year 2017...

A continuous flow of fragmentary images...

Pieces of the world flowed by without
context...

I was simply an onlooker of everything in the
world.

Yes... I couldn't take part, I could only
watch... I was nothing more than a 'perspective'.


19 :

{T6A305}
[£o¢o]
Agh... Ah... Uugh...


{T6A306}
[£o¢o]
Uggh... Aaaah... Aaaahhh...


{T6A307}
[£o¢o]
Nnn... Uuuh... Uuugh...

£o¢o groaned and pressed her hand
against her mouth.

Fresh, crimson blood dribbled through the
cracks of her fingers.

A red stain spread on the floor of the
control room.


{T6A311}
[Sora]
...This is bad...!


{T6A312}
[Sora]
These... These symptoms are...!


{T6A313}
[Tsugumi]
Symptoms!? Who cares about symptoms!?


{T6A314}
[Tsugumi]
"Can't you tell!? If this keeps up, £o¢o's 
going to...!"


{T6A315}
[Kaburaki]
£o¢o, hang in there!


{T6A316}
[Y¤u]
Ku-Kuranari... what are we going to do!?


{C6A000}
[Takeshi]
Wait! Don't panic! Everyone just calm down!


20 :
I was only a 'perspective' and had no real
sense of feeling.

The link between my sight and consciousness
had been broken, and all I could do was
continually gaze at the scene unfolding
before me.

I felt neither sadness nor anger... Neither
impatience nor despair...

I was looking at the reality in front of me
as one might stare at a meaningless jumble of
numbers.


21 :
'Tief Blau 2017-Rev.17'

The L-MRI was scanning £o¢o's condition.

The Tief Blau virus‡L


22 :

{T6B017}
[Kaburaki]
£o¢o, hold on!


{T6B018}
[Kaburaki]
...No! Don't you die on me!

£o¢o's body lay on the examination table.

Kaburaki held her thin arm intensely.


{T6B019}
[Kaburaki]
Open your eyes, £o¢o!


{T6B020}
[Kaburaki]
Please! Wake up!

The Kid grabbed hold of £o¢o's shoulders
and shook her violently.


23 :

{C6A002}
[Takeshi]
Hey, cut it out! Stop it, Kid!

Takeshi pulled him back from £o¢o.


24 :

{T6B021}
[Kaburaki]
What are you doing!?


{C6A003}
[Takeshi]
Jackass! Calm the hell down!


{C6A004}
[Takeshi]
"What do you think that's going to accomplish, 
huh!?"


{T6B022}
[Kaburaki]
But £o¢o's gonna... She's gonna!


25 :

{T6B023}
[Kaburaki]
"If we don't do anything, £o¢o's... going to 
die!"


{C6A005}
[Takeshi]
"Calm down. There's got to be something we can 
do..."


26 :

{C6A006}
[Takeshi]
"Don't get crazy. Let's just calm down and 
think..."


27 :
Sora interrupted Takeshi and the Kid with
her hand.

Looking all of the people gathered in the
face, she announced...


28 :

{T6B060}
[Sora]
"There is an installation called IBF directly 
below us."


{T6B067}
[Sora]
"The management company that built LeMU is 
Leiblich Pharmaceuticals. Their research 
facility is IBF."


29 :

{C6A007}
[Takeshi]
IBF...?

Takeshi mumbled to himself.

It seemed as if it was familiar to him.


30 :

{T6B076}
[Sora]
"There is a medical center there that is far 
superior to this one."


{T6B077}
[Sora]
"At least from the information I can get from 
LeMMIH's database..."


{T6B078}
[Sora]
"It appears that they have a new type of 
'high-pressure oxygen treatment device' 
there..."


{T6B079}
[Sora]
"And if we can treat her with that, her 
leukocyte, er, white blood cell activity 
should increase."


{T6B080}
[Sora]
That should ease £o¢o-chan's condition somewhat.


31 :

{C6A008}
[Takeshi]
Alright then...


{C6A009}
[Takeshi]
IBF...


{C6A010}
[Takeshi]
"So all we need to do is get her there, and £o¢o 
can be saved, right?"


32 :

{T6B101}
[Sora]
"However, in order to get to IBF, we have to 
get through Himmel... and Himmel's door isn't 
opening."


33 :

{C6A011}
[Takeshi]
I don't care, we're going!


{C6A012}
[Takeshi]
There isn't any other way there.


34 :

{C6A013}
[Takeshi]
It might not work...


35 :

{C6A014}
[Takeshi]
But we don't know that unless we try, right?


{C6A015}
[Takeshi]
Sora, show me how to get there.


36 :
[Sora]
.........


37 :

{C6A016}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid... Give me a hand!


38 :

{T6B102}
[Kaburaki]
O-okay.


39 :
Takeshi picked up £o¢o's inert body and
carried her piggyback.


40 :
They arrived at Himmel.

The door was shut fast.


41 :

{C6A017}
[Takeshi]
Damn it, what are we going to do!?

[Kaburaki]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Sora]
.........


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whine*...


42 :
£o¢o slid off of Takeshi's back.

She weakly hunched over on the floor.

The color of her face had gone translucent
white, her lips parched, and her eyes looked
feverish.

Just then...


43 :

{C6A018A}
[Announcement]
"<Öffnen Sie 

{C6A018B}
die Tür von HIMMEL.>"

44 :

{C6A019}
[Takeshi]
What's that announcement...?


45 :

{T6B137}
[Sora]
Someone is trying to access LeMMIH's system!


{T6B138}
[Sora]
"From inside the room... From a terminal inside 
Himmel!"


46 :

{C6A020}
[Takeshi]
What!?


47 :
The access indicator light for the electronic
lock to began blink and soon changed to green.

The hatch's lever raised and turned
automatically...


48 :
The door opened.


49 :
It was pure white inside.

Squinting against the brightness, they walked
into the room to explore.

It appeared as if it was the computer
control room.


50 :

{C6A021}
[Takeshi]
H-hey! There's someone here...


{C6A022}
[Takeshi]
Did he open up the door just now?


51 :
There was someone passed out on the floor.

He was a man who appeared to be in his forties,
dressed in a white lab coat.


52 :

{C6A023}
[Takeshi]
Hey, buddy! Are you alright!?

Takeshi rushed over to the man and lifted him
into a sitting position.

[???]
.........

The man didn't reply to Takeshi's call. He
just sat there with his eyes closed.


53 :

{C6A024}
[Takeshi]
Who is this guy...?


54 :

{C6A025}
[Takeshi]
Sora, do you have any idea who this is?


55 :

{T6B139}
[Sora]
No, I am unable to verify his ID...


{T6B140}
[Sora]
"But judging from the way he is dressed, it 
is safe to assume he was a researcher at the 
IBF facility."


56 :

{C6A026}
[Researcher]
Uuugh...

The researcher let out a dry gasp and opened
his eyes slightly.


57 :

{C6A027}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, are you one of the staff from the 
research facility?"


{C6A028}
[Researcher]
Y-yeah... That's right...


{C6A029}
[Researcher]
"Doesn't seem like you're... here to rescue 
me..."

With a shaking hand, he grabbed onto Takeshi.

The hand was covered in blood...


{C6A030}
[Researcher]
"So there were still people in LeMU... and 
it's been six days since..."


{C6A031}
[Researcher]
Hahaha, what a surprise... *gagh*...

Blood trickled from his mouth, and he smiled
wryly.


58 :

{C6A032}
[Takeshi]
"H-hey! Don't strain yourself. You don't have 
to talk!"


{C6A033}
[Researcher]
I'm so sorry... It's all our fault...


59 :

{C6A034}
[Takeshi]
"What happened? Did something happen down 
there?"

Everyone stood quietly, gathered around the
researcher, and seemed to have lost the
ability to talk.

The research worker murmured and looked up
vacantly at all the figures around him.


{C6A035}
[Researcher]
But why all this...?


{C6A036}
[Researcher]
This...

After that, he was silent.

His eyelids slowly closed.


60 :

{C6A037}
[Takeshi]
Hey! Hey! Hang in there!


61 :
Takeshi shook the man's shoulders.

There was no response. But at least it seemed
he was breathing.


62 :

{T6B151}
[Tsugumi]
We'll... We'll have to bring him with us.


63 :
Takeshi nodded and stood up, then picked up the
unconscious researcher.

Watching the situation, Sora began a quiet
explanation...


64 :

{T6B152}
[Sora]
"Everyone, at the far end of this room is 
another room. Can you see it?"


{T6B154}
[Sora]
That is the compression chamber for IBF.


{T6B155}
[Sora]
Judging from my incomplete data...


{T6B156}
[Sora]
"IBF is enclosed in higher pressure gas than 
LeMU. The IBF area is set to what is known as 
'saturated diving specifications'."


{T6B157}
[Sora]
"This type of area is also probably more 
suitable for research with bacteria... The 
atmospheric pressure of IBF is actually at 
about 12.5 atmospheres."


65 :

{T6B158}
[Sora]
I want all of you to enter that room.


{T6B159}
[Sora]
"And after you spend about one hour in the 
compression chamber, you'll take the access 
elevator down to IBF."


{T6B160}
[Sora]
And I should tell you this as a precaution...


{T6B161}
[Sora]
"You will not be able to retrace your steps 
easily from this point on. Please give this 
due consideration."


66 :
Following Sora's instructions, everyone headed
into the IBF compression chamber.


67 :
The long compression started...

During that time, nobody said a single word.


68 :
The compression finished‡L

Everyone got aboard the lift.

The door sealed and the elevator started to
lower as though it was sliding.


{C6A040}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 70 meter...>


{C6A041}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 80 meter...>


{C6A042}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 90 meter...>


{C6A043}
[Announcement]
<Tiefe 119 meter.>


69 :
The door opened and everyone poured out.

It seemed that there was a pool where a small
submarine could dock.

Although the area was directly attached to
the ocean, the inside and outside pressure
were the same, keeping the ocean water out of
the room.

It was the same as turning a cup upside down
and putting it in water.

They all stopped in their tracks and studied
their surroundings tensely, as if waiting for
an alarm to go off.

There was no sign of anyone.


70 :

{C6A044}
[Takeshi]
Anyway, let's get to where we have to go.


71 :
They opened a watertight door at the other
side of the room and continued deeper into the
installation.


72 :
‡LThe examination room.

The Kid and Y¤u placed £o¢o, who they'd been
carrying, on a nearby bed.

Tsugumi and Takeshi slowly lowered the researcher
down into a chair.

An L-MRI, the same type that had been in
LeMU's infirmary, was in the room.


73 :

{C6A045}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Y¤u? Where is that high-pressure 
oxygen thing that Sora was talking about?"


74 :

{T6B183}
[Y¤u]
H-how should I know...?


75 :

{C6A046}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, what should we do?


76 :

{T6B184}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, we'll have to look for it. None of us 
know a thing about this place."


77 :

{C6A047}
[Researcher]
*Gagh*... W-wait!


78 :
The researcher coughed as he spoke.


79 :

{C6A048}
[Takeshi]
H-hey, don't move! Are you okay!?


80 :

{C6A049}
[Researcher]
I've been better... but at least I'm alive...


81 :
The researcher raised his hand weakly as he
spoke.


{C6A050}
[Researcher]
This smell... Is this IBF?


{C6A051}
[Researcher]
So I'm back where I started... *cough*


82 :

{C6A052}
[Takeshi]
So you WERE working here...


{C6A053}
[Takeshi]
"Well then, there's something I want to ask 
you. We're looking for some kind of 
high-pressure oxygen treatment device."


{C6A054}
[Takeshi]
"We've come as far as the examination room, 
but we don't have a clue what to look for. 
Can you help us? Please!"


{C6A055}
[Researcher]
"Oxygen treatment... Yeah, you're looking for 
the pods."


{C6A056}
[Researcher]
"There should be some alloy capsules with 
mats set inside of them."


{C6A057}
[Researcher]
"They look like a bunch of cylinders stuck to 
a pillar... You see them?"


{C6A058}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, they're right in front of me.


{C6A059}
[Researcher]
That's them... *cough*...


83 :

{C6A060}
[Takeshi]
"Hang in there...! We found them. So don't 
waste your energy talking anymore, okay?"

New blood appeared on the researcher's closed
hand as he wiped his mouth.


{C6A061}
[Researcher]
"Just take a look at the manual... They should 
be... easy to operate."


84 :

{C6A062}
[Takeshi]
Okay, I gotcha...

The strength left the researcher's hand...

As he sat there, it seemed all the life had
left the researcher's body, and he looked
like an old, withered-up tree.


85 :

{C6A063}
[Takeshi]
"Let's get £o¢o into a pod... and this 
researcher too."


86 :

{T6B194}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...


87 :
They put £o¢o and the researcher into
separate pods and closed the lids.


88 :

{C6A064}
[Takeshi]
Did you find the manual?


89 :

{T6B195}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. This is the control panel...


90 :
Flipping through a thick book that appeared
to be the manual, Y¤u started operating a
terminal a short distance away.


{T6B196}
[Y¤u]
High-pressure oxygen treatment... set...

The screens of the monitors attached to the
tubes flickered. Both of the pods seemed
to be functioning normally.


91 :

{T6B197}
[Y¤u]
That should do it.


{C6A065}
[Takeshi]
Okay...

Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration
rate... normal.

They silently watched £o¢o and the researcher.

Although it was too soon to say if they had
recovered, £o¢o and the researcher's face
seemed to settle a bit.

They had somehow managed to stave off death.


92 :

{T6B198}
[Y¤u]
I'm so relieved...


{T6B199}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah... Tell me about it.


{T6B200}
[Kaburaki]
Yeah...


93 :

{C6A066}
[Takeshi]
Looks like we made it in time.


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

Everyone let out a sigh of relief.

It seemed as if they had escaped the worst
for the moment.


94 :

{C6A067}
[Takeshi]
Well...


{C6A068}
[Takeshi]
We don't have time to hang around, you know?


95 :
They started searching around the facility.

Their aim was threefold... To find a way to
escape the facility, to see if any
communication lines were open, and to look
for any other survivors.

While Takeshi, Tsugumi, and the young Kaburaki
were searching around IBF, Y¤u stayed with
the resting £o¢o and researcher.

Meanwhile...


96 :
Takeshi and the others soon arrived at a
small room covered in iron plating.

There were a few computer terminals there with
nobody stationed at them.

Operating the terminals, they scanned through
some of the information there.

They were searching for any information that
they could use and finally came across
something interesting.

{16:4}

97 :
'IBF Visitor Registry: Yagami £o¢o'

£o¢o's name was listed in the corner of a
business log.

Looking further into the file, there seemed
to be a personal memo written by somebody.

{16:4}

98 :
'Author: Yagami Takeshi'

'I get to see my daughter for the first time
in a while.'

'Her school is on vacation, so she has a
ten-day break.'

'I've been trapped for so long in this tin
can doing virus research that I'm jealous...'

{16:4}

99 :
'That aside, when I told her that special
permission had been granted for her to come
down and see IBF, she sent me a happy reply
saying she would.'

'We've exchanged mail every once in a while,
but I wonder how long it's been since we've
actually seen each other?'

'I'll just be happy if she hasn't forgotten
what I look like.'

{16:4}

100 :
Which meant that £o¢o had visited IBF
once before May 1st.

To meet her father...

{16:4}

101 :
Postscript‡L

'It seems like T.Y.'s daughter is working
part-time here at LeMU. I'm still not sure if
I should tell him or...'

{16:4}

102 :
After that point, all the data was corrupted,
making it impossible to check what else had
been written.

{16:4}

103 :
In the end, they found nothing. No way out,
no means to communicate, and no survivors.


After searching around, Takeshi, Kaburaki, and
Tsugumi all headed back to the examination
room.


104 :

{C6A069}
[Takeshi]
Y¤u, how're they doing?


105 :

{T6B201}
[Y¤u]
"Ah... Yeah. It looks like they're doing okay 
for now."

Y¤u looked tired as she sat down and faced
the pod's control panel.

Her eyes were a bit red, as if she'd been
crying.


{T6B202}
[Y¤u]
"Oh yeah, Kuranari. I checked the medical 
database on this terminal earlier, but..."


{C6A070}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, did you find something?


106 :

{T6B203}
[Y¤u]
Yeah...


{T6B204}
[Y¤u]
"It looks as if they still haven't found any 
definite way... to treat the Tief Blau virus."


{T6B205}
[Y¤u]
"Although the symptoms can be temporarily 
treated by injecting that orange serum..."


{T6B206}
[Y¤u]
"Otherwise, the only option is to hope for 
the small chance that it will clear up by 
itself."


107 :

{C6A071}
[Takeshi]
Oh...


{C6A072}
[Takeshi]
That sucks...


108 :

{T6B207}
[Kaburaki]
Huh?


109 :

{T6B208}
[Kaburaki]
What do you mean?


110 :

{T6B209}
[Y¤u]
Um...


111 :

{T6B210}
[Tsugumi]
Well, basically...


{T6B211}
[Tsugumi]
"If £o¢o is going to heal, her immune system 
is going to have to work a little harder."


{T6B212}
[Tsugumi]
"We've brought her to the treatment pod, so all 
we can do now is hope."


112 :

{T6B213}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, that's all we can do.


113 :

{T6B214}
[Kaburaki]
No...


{T6B215}
[Kaburaki]
£o¢o isn't going to get better?


114 :

{C6A073}
[Takeshi]
Nobody said that.


115 :

{C6A074}
[Takeshi]
"Whether she gets better or not... is up to 
£o¢o's will to live."


116 :
The young Kaburaki walked over to the pod
where £o¢o was sleeping.


{T6B216}
[Kaburaki]
£o¢o...


{T6B217}
[Kaburaki]
£o¢o...

He started to cry, latching onto the pod as
though he was embracing it.


117 :

{T6B218}
[Y¤u]
"We still don't know how much this pod is 
going to help £o¢o."

Y¤u murmured softly as she read the life
signs on the monitor.


{T6B219}
[Y¤u]
"It seems that this pod can also do laser 
disinfecting, as well as simple surgery, in 
addition to the oxygen treatment."


{T6B220}
[Y¤u]
"And depending on how you use it, even 
cryogenic suspension..."


118 :

{T6B221}
[Tsugumi]
Cryogenic suspension?


{C6A075}
[Takeshi]
What's that... Y¤u?


119 :

{T6B222}
[Y¤u]
I'm not sure. It was just in the manual...


{T6B223}
[Y¤u]
We don't really know what's going to happen.


{T6B224}
[Y¤u]
All we can do is have faith and wait.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Kaburaki]
.........


{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
*Whine*...


120 :
Right then...


121 :
‡LBeeep!

A sharp alarm sounded from the control panel
monitor.

Shocked, the four of them all turned to face
the screen at once.


122 :

{T6B225}
[Researcher]
Aagh...!

An agonized expression came over the face of
the researcher.

He thrashed and contorted inside of the
cramped capsule.


123 :

{T6B226}
[Y¤u]
Aaah!


{C6A077}
[Takeshi]
H-hey, man!

The researcher coughed violently and clawed
at his throat.

His hand and the area around his mouth were
stained red.


{T6B227}
[Researcher]
Aaaaaaghhh...!

The color quickly drained from his skin.

His breathing became shallow, and he groaned
in a low voice.


124 :

{T6B228}
[Y¤u]
"No! I can't believe his condition would 
change like this!"


{C6A079}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, man! Stop grabbing at your throat like 
that! You'll crush it!"


{C6A080}
[Researcher]
Gaaguh...


{C6A081}
[Researcher]
*Huuugh*... *Huuugh*... *Huuugh*...

He slowly lowered the hands which he been
thrashing at his throat with.


{C6A082}
[Takeshi]
Hey, man, are you alright!?


{C6A083}
[Researcher]
No...


{C6A084}
[Researcher]
This... is as far... as I make it.

The researcher was barely breathing.

He was trying to breathe.

He let out a gasp...

But wasn't able to bring in air.


{C6A085}
[Researcher]
This... is... my... reward...


125 :

{T6B234}
[Y¤u]
!


126 :
Y¤u pored over the manual and desperately
searched the control panel.

But... there was nothing she could do. There
was no way for her to keep him alive.

She pounded on the manual.

Then she placed both elbows on the panel and
covered her face with her hands.


{T6B235}
[Y¤u]
Aaah...

She burst into tears.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kaburaki]
.........

Tsugumi and Kaburaki gazed at the monitor with
strained expressions.

The researcher's vital signs were getting
weaker.


127 :

{C6A086}
[Researcher]
...My daughter...


{C6A087}
[Researcher]
Take care of... My daughter...

He looked as though he was smiling.

And...


128 :
Finally, he stopped breathing.

Beeeeeeeeep...

The life readings from the capsule pod went
blank, and an electronic alarm sounded for what
seemed like forever.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kaburaki]
.........

[Pipi]
.........


129 :
Takeshi reached out his hand to the panel and
turned off the alarm.


130 :

{C6A088}
[Takeshi]
How is... £o¢o?


{T6B238}
[Y¤u]
Normal...

Y¤u replied in a voice filled with tears.


{T6B239}
[Y¤u]
"There doesn't seem to be anything wrong for 
the moment..."


{C6A089}
[Takeshi]
Okay... Thanks.


{C6A090}
[Takeshi]
"We'll have to make sure... he gets a proper 
burial..."


131 :
It was an unsettling silence.

In the belly of that iron hulk, they stopped
breathing and stood still.

Their expressions were lifeless.

It was impossible to tell what any of them
were thinking.

The white interior of the room was filled
with a quiet calm.

Time passed slowly, cruelly, crawling forward
second by second.


132 :
.........

......

...


133 :
Takeshi and Y¤u leaned against the wall of the
corridor.


{T6L014}
[Y¤u]
"I'm sure some kind of circumstances kept him 
from escaping. And circumstances that kept him 
alive..."

Y¤u finally spoke.

Her small voice bounced off of the cold iron
walls of the partitioning.


134 :

{C6A103}
[Takeshi]
Circumstances?


{T6L015}
[Y¤u]
"Before he died and everyone was off 
searching... I had the chance to talk with him 
some."


{T6L016}
[Y¤u]
"I tried to get him to stop, because he 
seemed like he was suffering, but..."


{T6L017}
[Y¤u]
He said talking made him feel better, so...


{C6A104}
[Takeshi]
I see... Well, what did he talk about?


{T6L018}
[Y¤u]
Um...


{T6L021}
[Y¤u]
"Before coming to IBF, he said that he'd been 
involved with the project to develop LeMU's 
system."


{T6L022}
[Y¤u]
"He was one of the staff who engineered 
LeMU's management software."


{C6A105}
[Takeshi]
Meaning... that...


{T6L023}
[Y¤u]
"Himmel, LeMMIH, and... Sora. Everything he 
left behind is here in LeMU."


{T6L024}
[Y¤u]
Being a programmer...


{T6L025}
[Y¤u]
"The system here at LeMU was like his own 
child."


135 :

{C6A106}
[Takeshi]
So... he was worried about his 'children'?


{T6L026}
[Y¤u]
Yeah... That must have been it.


{T6L027}
[Y¤u]
"Worrying about his children is what helped 
him live a while longer."

She closed her eyes and let out a small sigh.

And as if shrugging off the heaviness of the
moment, she bolted away from the wall and
said...


136 :

{T6L028}
[Y¤u]
"Oh yeah. There was one other thing I heard 
from him that I was able to check up on."


137 :

{C6A107}
[Takeshi]
What's that?


{T6L031}
[Y¤u]
Sora's location...


{T6L032}
[Y¤u]
"Sora is... The Sora that we know isn't in 
Insel Null."


{C6A108}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T6L033}
[Y¤u]
"We know that LeMMIH's central processing 
unit‡Lthe main supercomputer‡Lis on the 
floating island..."


{T6L034}
[Y¤u]
"It seems that everything that happens here 
in LeMU is saved in LeMU's memory storage."


138 :

{C6A109}
[Takeshi]
What?


{T6L036}
[Y¤u]
"Leiblich Pharmaceuticals keeps an original 
system program for 'Akanegasaki Sora'."


{T6L037}
[Y¤u]
"So, even if they lose the copy here at LeMU, 
it won't hurt them at all."


{T6L038}
[Y¤u]
"So basically... it's possible to make many 
different versions of the 'Sora' system."


{T6L039}
[Y¤u]
Even the Sora here might just be a copy.


{T6L040}
[Y¤u]
But if you think about it...


{T6L041}
[Y¤u]
Sora is Sora, right?


{T6L042}
[Y¤u]
There's only one Sora that we know, right?


{T6L043}
[Y¤u]
"So what's the only thing that separates the 
Sora we know from other Soras?"


{C6A110}
[Takeshi]
That would be...


{T6L045}
[Y¤u]
Memory.


{T6L046}
[Y¤u]
"The only thing that we and the Sora here 
share is..."


{T6L047}
[Y¤u]
Memory. That's it.

Takeshi tapped repeatedly on the area between
his eyebrows and opened his mouth.


139 :

{C6A111}
[Takeshi]
Really...


{C6A112}
[Takeshi]
If Sora's memory is here at LeMU...


{C6A113}
[Takeshi]
Then the Sora we know is...


{C6A114}
[Takeshi]
Sora is... in 'Himmel'...

Y¤u nodded.


140 :
She touched Takeshi's shoulder lightly and
traced her finger across his chest, then went back
into the examination room.


141 :
Left by himself, Takeshi started wandering
aimlessly down the corridor.

He turned right at a corner, then left,
and continued walking with his hand on the wall.

He ended up in front of IBF's large pool.


142 :
There was already someone there.

Tsugumi was looking at the gentle ripples in
the pool.

As if she had drawn him there, Takeshi went
to stand by Tsugumi.


143 :

{C6A127}
[Takeshi]
Huh...?

Takeshi stopped suddenly.

He turned around and stared at a spot on the
wall.


144 :

{T6T040}
[Tsugumi]
Hm? Takeshi... What's wrong?

Tsugumi noticed Takeshi...


145 :
Following Takeshi's gaze, she turned her eyes
to stare over at the same spot on the wall.

There was nothing there.

Wait...

No, that wasn't true.

Both of their lines of sight were pointed
at‡L'me'.

Takeshi and Tsugumi were looking at‡L'me'
right then.


146 :

{C6A128}
[Takeshi]
Uh...


{C6A129}
[Takeshi]
I'm not really sure, but...


{C6A130}
[Takeshi]
"I felt like somebody was... you know, staring 
at me..."

Takeshi turned back and said that to Tsugumi.


147 :
[Tsugumi]
?

Tsugumi tilted her head quizzically.

And with her head turned to the side, she
narrowed her eyes and searched Takeshi's face.


148 :

{T6T041}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...?


{T6T042}
[Tsugumi]
Your... nose is bleeding...


{C6A131}
[Takeshi]
?


{T6T043}
[Tsugumi]
You've got a nosebleed.


149 :

{C6A132}
[Takeshi]
Eh?

Takeshi quickly put his hand to his nose.

His upper lip was wet with something.


150 :

{T6T044}
[Tsugumi]
He-hey? Are you okay?

Tsugumi looked worriedly at Takeshi's face.


151 :

{C6A133}
[Takeshi]
I-it's fine, it's fine...

Takeshi looked up and wiped under my nose
as he replied.


152 :

{C6A134}
[Takeshi]
"I wasn't thinking anything sexual! 
Absolutely! Positively!"


153 :

{T6T045}
[Tsugumi]
I-it's not like I... I don't care about that!


154 :

{C6A135}
[Takeshi]
Well, alright then...

His nose wouldn't stop bleeding.


{C6A136}
[Takeshi]
Aaah, I look like such a dork.


{T6T046}
[Tsugumi]
Who cares what you look like?


155 :

{C6A137}
[Takeshi]
"I care. Looking like this in front of you, 
I... uugh..."


{C6A138}
[Takeshi]
Aaaaagh...


156 :

{C6A139}
[Takeshi]
Uuurgh!


157 :
Takeshi spat out blood.

Copious amounts of fresh blood poured from
his nose and mouth.

Simultaneously, his knees buckled.


158 :

{C6A140}
[Takeshi]
H-huh...? Wh-what's wrong... with... me...

Takeshi looked at his blood-covered hands and
blinked.

His legs swayed unsteadily, and the color
quickly drained from his face.


{C6A141}
[Takeshi]
Wh-what this... about...


{C6A142}
[Takeshi]
...Blood... Blood... Blood is...


159 :

{T6T050}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi!


{T6T051}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, hang in there!


160 :

{C6A143}
[Takeshi]
N-no, I'm fine. Don't worry, Tsugumi...


161 :

{C6A144}
[Takeshi]
Don't... worry...


162 :

{T6T053}
[Tsugumi]
You're not fine at all!


{T6T054}
[Tsugumi]
You're bleeding all over, Takeshi!


{T6T055}
[Tsugumi]
"We need to get you to the examination room 
and get you looked at right away."


{C6A145}
[Takeshi]
Y-yeah... *Cough*...


163 :
Tsugumi supported Takeshi with her shoulder
and pulled him along into the entrance of the
corridor.

From the entrance, a single shadow jumped out.


It was Yubiseiharukana.


164 :

{T6T056}
[Y¤u]
"Tsugumi, Kuranari! The Kid! The Kid's in bad 
shape!"


165 :
After that...

Using the L-MRI, they found out that Takeshi,
Y¤u, and the young Kaburaki were all infected
with the Tief Blau virus.

Using the orange serum, the three of them
were given shots...

After that, their symptoms improved a bit, but
the severity of the situation had still not
changed.


166 :

{C6A171}
[Takeshi]
What do we do about £o¢o?

Takeshi asked this as he pressed down on the
disinfectant-stained gauze covering his injection.


{T6T086}
[Tsugumi]
"She's still undergoing the oxygen treatment. 
So we can't open the pod."


{T6T087}
[Tsugumi]
"It looks like the treatment is progressing 
normally. As long as she's in there, I don't 
think her condition will get much worse..."


{T6T088}
[Tsugumi]
"As soon as it's done, let's give £o¢o a 
shot too."


167 :

{C6A172}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, okay...

Takeshi's face was still pale.

It was hard to believe that it had ever been
the color of a living person.


168 :
His pupils were cloudy, his eyelids swollen,
and sweat flowed freely down his face.

Wiping away that sweat, Takeshi wandered around
the room.


169 :

{C6A186}
[Takeshi]
"I'm not sure how long our condition will 
hold with just one shot..."


{C6A187}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Y¤u? Do you think we can do anything 
after it stops working?"

Y¤u was sitting at the computer terminal,
silently typing on the keyboard.


170 :

{C6A188}
[Takeshi]
Y¤u, tell me what we can expect?


171 :

{T6T108}
[Y¤u]
Don't talk to me, I can't concentrate.


{C6A189}
[Takeshi]
Alright, alright.


172 :

{T6T109}
[Y¤u]
I'm trying my best...


173 :

{T6T110}
[Y¤u]
"But someone has put a lock on the 
communications protocol, and we can't make 
contact with the surface."


{T6T111}
[Y¤u]
"But every once in a while, I've found some 
communication data that crosses through."


{T6T112}
[Y¤u]
"If I can release that lock, or... Well, 
anyway, we just might be able to get through 
somehow."


{T6T113}
[Y¤u]
"At least it's better than LeMU, where we 
had no way of making contact."


174 :

{C6A190}
[Takeshi]
Alright, show me what you got, genius!


175 :

{T6T114}
[Y¤u]
Okay...

And looking like the dead, they both smiled
weakly at one another.

Brownish bloodstains were smeared on their
mouths.


176 :
Takeshi left Y¤u to go look at the monitor
set into the column.

The monitor displayed the status of the
capsule pods.


177 :

{T6T115}
[Tsugumi]
How is £o¢o doing?

Tsugumi came up beside Takeshi and asked.


{C6A191}
[Takeshi]
She's in 'serious but stable' condition.


{T6T116}
[Tsugumi]
Really...

According to the information on the monitor,
£o¢o still had four more hours until she
could come out...

The pod was filled with high-pressure oxygen.

And until the time was over, £o¢o couldn't
leave.


178 :

{C6A192}
[Tsugumi]
Hey? Takeshi...

Tsugumi whispered to Takeshi softly.


{C6A193}
[Takeshi]
What?


{C6A194}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't you think it's strange that I don't 
need any serum?"


{C6A195}
[Takeshi]
"Huh? A-ah... Well, now that you mention 
it... yeah..."


{C6A196}
[Takeshi]
Are you okay?


179 :

{C6A197}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, I'm fine.


{C6A198}
[Tsugumi]
Fine...


180 :

{C6A199}
[Takeshi]
Oh? Well, that's a relief...


{C6A200}
[Tsugumi]
But you don't think it's strange?


{C6A201}
[Tsugumi]
"I'm the only one who doesn't show any 
symptoms of the Tief Blau virus."


{C6A202}
[Tsugumi]
Isn't that odd...?


{C6A203}
[Takeshi]
Well... No, I mean...

Takeshi smiled softly and continued.


181 :

{C6A204}
[Takeshi]
You said it yourself...


{C6A205}
[Takeshi]
"'The functioning of your immune system and 
metabolic efficiency are remarkable... and 
your telomeres... never stop regenerating.'"


{C6A206}
[Takeshi]
Meaning...


{C6A207}
[Takeshi]
...It's... Well, you know?


{C6A208}
[Tsugumi]
Y-yeah...

She looked down slightly and puffed out her
cheeks.

She raised her eyes...


182 :
Tsugumi walked over to Y¤u and murmured...


183 :

{C6A209}
[Tsugumi]
Y¤u... would you scan me?


{C6A210}
[Tsugumi]
Would you... check me?


184 :
'Curé Virus-P-Carrier'

Those words appeared on the L-MRI display
without a sound.

The screen showed that Tsugumi was a Curé
virus carrier.


185 :
The Tief Blau virus was also in Tsugumi's
body, as with the others.

But her genetic makeup had been altered by
Curé...

And because of the peculiar functioning of her
immune system, antibodies had been generated
instantly, driving out Tief Blau.

Curé...

Tsugumi had gone beyond the normal human
capability...

She had mentioned that she was 'special'.

Successful cases of genetic manipulation were
probably exceedingly rare.


186 :

{C6A211}
[Y¤u]
Curé...

Looking at the results from the L-MRI scan,
Y¤u nodded.


{C6A212}
[Y¤u]
So... the Curé virus really does exist.


187 :

{C6A213}
[Takeshi]
Do you know about it, Y¤u?


188 :

{C6A214}
[Y¤u]
I found it in LeMU's database...


{C6A215}
[Y¤u]
"But before that, I'd heard about it 
once... from a certain person."


{C6A216}
[Takeshi]
A certain person...?


{C6A217}
[Y¤u]
Someone called Morino Shigezo.


{C6A218}
[Y¤u]
He's a world-renowned geneticist...


{C6A219}
[Y¤u]
He told me about it when I met him.


{C6A220}
[Y¤u]
"'In this world there are probably at least 
two or more types of the Curé virus...'"


{C6A221}
[Y¤u]
So this must be one of them...


189 :

{C6A222}
[Tsugumi]
Yes. Me.


{C6A223}
[Tsugumi]
I'm a carrier of the Curé virus.


{C6A225}
[Tsugumi]
I'm already not like other people.


190 :

{C6A226}
[Y¤u]
But...


{C6A227}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi, why would you...?


191 :

{C6A228}
[Tsugumi]
"I already told Takeshi, but... I also want 
you to know, Y¤u..."


{C6A229}
[Tsugumi]
"Besides, it's easier to have the machine 
show you than to explain it myself, right?"


{C6A230}
[Y¤u]
That's why... you wanted me to scan you?


{C6A231}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah.


{C6A232}
[Tsugumi]
Well, I don't suppose...


192 :

{C6A233}
[Tsugumi]
"Anything changes now that you've found 
out...?"

Tsugumi laughed at herself derisively.


193 :

{C6A234}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi...


{C6A235}
[Tsugumi]
Heh heh... It's strange, Takeshi.

Biting her lip, Tsugumi was trying her best to
laugh.


{C6A236}
[Tsugumi]
"But there's something even stranger than 
me..."


{C6A237}
[Tsugumi]
"This machine knew right away that I had the 
Curé virus... Why do you think?"


{C6A238}
[Tsugumi]
"There have only been a few documented cases 
of Curé in the whole world. Why do you think 
this computer could scan it so quickly?"

Takeshi's pupils dilated momentarily

He squinted and replied slowly.


194 :

{C6A239}
[Takeshi]
Oh, so that's it...


{C6A240}
[Takeshi]
"Leiblich Pharmaceuticals already knew about 
the existence of the Curé virus..."


{C6A241}
[Takeshi]
Just like Tief Blau...


{C6A242}
[Tsugumi]
Yep.

Tsugumi turned up to face the ceiling and
closed her eyes, saying...


195 :

{C6A243}
[Tsugumi]
That's why... I came here. To LeMU. To IBF.


{C6A244}
[Tsugumi]
I HAD to come here.


{C6A245}
[Tsugumi]
"I wanted them to know the true gravity 
of... the seriousness of my existence..."


{C6A246}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{C6A247}
[Tsugumi]
I've come all this way, and nobody's here.


{C6A248}
[Tsugumi]
So stupid...


{C6A249}
[Tsugumi]
I'm so stupid...

From her closed eyes, a single tear fell.


196 :
.........

......

...


197 :
It suddenly became dark‡L

From the darkness, I could hear only voices...


{C6A250}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, Takeshi?


{C6A251}
[Tsugumi]
Have you ever hated everything...


{C6A252}
[Tsugumi]
And thought that you want to die?


{C6A253}
[Takeshi]
No.

Where was this?‡L'I' wondered.

Was I inside someone...?

I couldn't see anything.

All I could hear were voices coming from
somewhere.

Passionate voices...

An agonizing scream...


{C6A260}
[Takeshi]
"We aren't going to die! We're going to make 
it out of here!"


{C6A259}
[Takeshi]
We don't have any time to waste here!


{C6A261}
[Takeshi]
"I'm going to get out of this hell! I can 
save you, I'll prove it!"


{C6A262}
[Takeshi]
"Everyone! I'm going to save everyone who's 
here!"


{C6A263}
[Takeshi]
I won't let a single one die!

The voice cut out suddenly.

And the darkness cleared like a fog.

My vision returned gradually...


198 :
The scene spread out gradually before me...

But 'I' had still lost my center...

Other than a sense of impending disaster and
the stagnant, heavy air around me, I could
feel nothing else.

Look.

Stare intently.

'Why do you even bother looking?'‡Lwas a
doubt that crept through my mind, but it
faded quickly.

All I COULD do was to watch the events in
the world as they passed by...

I watched.

I was an existence that could only watch.

A perspective was all I was.


199 :

{C6A264}
[Takeshi]
It's time for desperate measures.

Takeshi said that suddenly.

His eyes shone with a dull light.

It seemed that the serum was losing its
effect. Although Takeshi, Y¤u, and the young
Kaburaki seemed to be maintaining their
composure...

Their breathing was ragged.


200 :

{C6A265}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I'm not a doctor, so I can't really 
tell, but..."


{C6A266}
[Takeshi]
Smallpox, penicillin, snake antivenom...


201 :

{C6A267}
[Takeshi]
"You're pretty smart, so this should make sense 
to you, right?"


202 :

{T6T170}
[Tsugumi]
N-no way.


{C6A268}
[Takeshi]
It's our only chance.


{C6A269}
[Takeshi]
"Your body is creating antibodies to the 
Tief Blau virus, so we'll use that."


{C6A270}
[Takeshi]
"If we can get those antibodies, there's a 
small chance we can fight off the Tief Blau."


203 :

{T6T171}
[Tsugumi]
It's too dangerous!


{T6T172}
[Tsugumi]
"Do you have any idea how hard it is to 
make antibodies and vaccines that work!?"


{T6T173}
[Tsugumi]
There's almost no chance!


{T6T174}
[Tsugumi]
"If you make even the slightest mistake, it 
could kill all of you!"


204 :

{C6A271}
[Takeshi]
If we don't do anything, we're dead anyway!


205 :
Tsugumi's expression froze.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kaburaki]
.........


206 :
Y¤u and the young Kaburaki, who had been staring
at the ground the whole time, raised their heads and
looked at Takeshi.

207 :

{C6A272}
[Takeshi]
"That's right... If we don't do anything, we're 
dead."


{C6A273}
[Takeshi]
And if that's the case...


{C6A274}
[Takeshi]
"It's better that we take this risk, no 
matter how small our chance of survival."


{C6A275}
[Takeshi]
...Uuh... *cough*...


208 :
Fresh blood flew from Takeshi's mouth.

A crimson mist danced in the air and floated
away.


209 :

{C6A276}
[Takeshi]
Damn, not again...


{C6A277}
[Takeshi]
I can't believe how lame this is...

Takeshi hurriedly wiped his mouth.


210 :

{C6A278}
[Takeshi]
"What? You aren't going to laugh at me 
for being such a dork, Tsugumi?"

[Tsugumi]
.........


{C6A279}
[Takeshi]
Come on, laugh, Tsugumi.

Takeshi held out his blood-covered hand toward
Tsugumi.


{T6T176}
[Tsugumi]
Stop it. Stay away from me...


{T6T177}
[Tsugumi]
Stop... I don't want to...

Shaking her head fiercely, Tsugumi backed away.


211 :

{T6T178}
[Y¤u]
Ku-Kuranari...


{T6T179}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kuranari, Tsugumi...

Y¤u opened her mouth to talk from where she
was seated at the terminal.


{T6T180}
[Y¤u]
"There's a simple lab in the back of the 
examination room."


{T6T181}
[Y¤u]
"I saw a centrifuge and a machine for refining 
serum..."


{T6T182}
[Y¤u]
"We could probably use that to safely and 
quickly extract the Tief Blau antibodies."


{T6T183}
[Y¤u]
"If this thing can scan for Tief Blau, it can 
probably scan for the antibodies and extract 
them."

She continued to talk in a low, calm voice.


212 :

{C6A281}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, please help us. I'm asking you.


{T6T184}
[Tsugumi]
Stay away from me, Takeshi...


{T6T185}
[Tsugumi]
Don't touch me...


213 :
Takeshi had backed her up all the way to the
bed.


214 :

{T6T186}
[Tsugumi]
You want to live with this disease!?


{T6T187}
[Tsugumi]
"Once you've got the Curé virus, you can't go 
back!"


{T6T188}
[Tsugumi]
Do you have any idea what you're in for!?


215 :

{C6A282}
[Takeshi]
"But we don't know that the Curé virus will 
infect everyone."


{C6A283}
[Takeshi]
Even you, you said you were special, right?


216 :

{C6A284}
[Takeshi]
Please... I'm begging you.


{C6A285}
[Takeshi]
"Let me take a gamble... so that everyone can 
live."


217 :

{T6T189}
[Tsugumi]
You won't be able to stay with people anymore!


{T6T190}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't want everyone to live with the pain 
that I have!"


218 :

{C6A288}
[Takeshi]
I know that.


{T6T201}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaggh...


{T6T202}
[Tsugumi]
You idiot... You idiot...


219 :

{T6T197}
[Tsugumi]
You know I can't fight you...!


220 :
Tsugumi ran into Takeshi's arms.

She nestled up close and began to cry with
all her might.


{T6T203}
[Tsugumi]
"If you mess this up... I'll never forgive 
you, Takeshi..."


{C6A291}
[Takeshi]
It's okay... It's going to be okay...


{C6A292}
[Takeshi]
"I promise you... we're all going to get out 
of this... okay?"


{T6T204}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaagh... Uuuugh...


{T6T205}
[Tsugumi]
Waaaaaaah...!

Tsugumi was crying.

Her breathing uneven and shoulders shaking,
Tsugumi wept freely on Takeshi's chest.

Takeshi embraced her thin body.

Her muffled cries continued to echo
throughout the cold room.
