1 :
I heard a song coming from somewhere...

It was a soft but somehow lonely voice
singing.

4 :
I awoke with a nostalgic feeling.

I found myself on a narrow bed in the
infirmary.

Looking up at the white ceiling, I gently
nodded off.

My memories slowly came back to me.

Flooding at the Cosmic Whale and saving Sara.

Sara coming back to life...

My fever worsening, and then me collapsing.


I looked over at the bed next to mine.

[Kid]
Sara...

Sara was asleep on the bed next to me.

Her breathing was regular, and her cheeks
flushed a healthy pink.

Feeling a bit relieved, I let myself half-doze.

From far away, I could hear faint voices.

They seemed to come from an incredible
distance and were all jumbled together,
but they sounded like Tsugumi and Takeshi.

Their voices echoed slightly.

The words were too faint for me to make out
what they were saying.

They were talking about Hammel or Harmeln
something. Words that I thought I'd heard
before, but the sounds quickly became
meaninglessly garbled in my mind.

After a while, the voices stopped.

Out of habit, I touched my pinky to the thumb
of my left hand.

It felt a bit strange.

I lifted my left hand and stared at the thumb.

Something was strange, out of place.


5 :
The blurriness of my vision suddenly came into
focus.

The scar was gone!

Why? How could it be gone?

I hurriedly sat up.

I stared at my left hand again.

The scar was nowhere to be found.

I was sure there had been a scar there.

I remembered noticing it when I had opened the
elevator to rescue Sara.

Had it just been a figment of my imagination?

No... I was sure it hadn't been. I was positive
there had been a scar.

But... why had the scar suddenly vanished?

A sense of loss flooded through me, making me
feel like I had a gaping hole in my heart.

I sensed that I had lost something critically
important, but I was unsure of what.

That was how I felt.

[Kid]
Sora! Sora!

Forgetting that Sara was sleeping, I shouted
out for Sora.


{S6A012}
[Sora]
Yes, Kid-san. What is it?

Sora's voice answered me.

[Kid]
Sora... Did you do something to me?


{S6A013}
[Sora]
Something...? What do you mean?

[Kid]
"Don't pretend you don't know! There was... 
a scar on my left hand!"

[Kid]
But... it's gone now!


6 :

{S6A014}
[Sora]
Oh, so that is what you mean.

Sora appeared in the entrance to the room.

[Kid]
What are you talking about?


7 :

{S6A015}
[Sora]
While you were sleeping, I extracted it.

[Kid]
Extracted what?


{S6A016}
[Sora]
Perhaps you should come over here.


8 :
I approached the examination table as Sora
suggested.


9 :

{S6A017}
[Sora]
This.

Sora pointed to a small shard suspended by a
manipulator arm above the examination table.


{S6A018}
[Sora]
"This was embedded in your thumb, so 
I extracted it."

[Kid]
What... gave you the right to do that?

[Kid]
It could have been a clue leading to my past!

I let loose on Sora without thinking.


10 :

{S6A019}
[Sora]
Yes, you are exactly right.


11 :

{S6A020}
[Sora]
"However, no good can come of leaving a 
foreign object in your body to fester."


12 :

{S6A021}
[Sora]
More importantly...


{S6A022}
[Sora]
"Kid, do you recall seeing this fragment 
before?"

[Kid]
No! How could I?

It didn't make sense to me why Sora would
ask such a thing.


{S6A023}
[Sora]
This fragment has an image recorded on it.

Sora continued speaking calmly.

[Kid]
An image?


{S6A024}
[Sora]
Would you like to see it?

I pinched the shard that had been buried in my
thumb between my fingers.

[Kid]
Th-this...?


13 :
It had the same holographic image as in Sara's
pendant.

There was an image of a man floating there.


{S6A025}
[Sora]
Can you see it?

[Kid]
Yeah, I can see it...


{S6A026}
[Sora]
"This hologram was designed so that it can 
only be seen when viewed with light of a 
certain wavelength."


{S6A027}
[Sora]
"Right now, I am using LeMMIH to shine the 
proper light on it."


{S6A028}
[Sora]
"I could not confirm the date of manufacture 
of this hologram, but it is undoubtedly very 
old."


{S6A029}
[Sora]
"Its makeup is fundamentally different from 
the ones being sold at LeMU's kiosks."


{S6A030}
[Sora]
"In the past, holograms were recorded using an 
interference pattern made from an object beam 
and a reference beam."


{S6A031}
[Sora]
"Put simply, the object beam is the light 
reflected off of the object."


{S6A032}
[Sora]
"The reference beam is the light that 
interferes with the object beam. 
Do you understand?"

Sora continued on without giving me time
to think.


{S6A033}
[Sora]
And now comes the important part...


{S6A034}
[Sora]
In order to make this hologram appear...


{S6A035}
[Sora]
"Light which is the same wavelength as the 
reference beam used to record the image 
must be shined upon it."


{S6A036}
[Sora]
So, to sum up, it is like this...


{S6A037}
[Sora]
"The image on this fragmented hologram was 
recorded using light that was a certain 
wavelength."


{S6A038}
[Sora]
"And in order to see the image, you must shine 
light of the same wavelength on it."


{S6A039}
[Sora]
"It also cannot be seen under fluorescent 
light."


{S6A040}
[Sora]
"You must use light generated by 
a heat-emitting light source, such as sunlight 
or the flame of a lighter."


{S6A041}
[Sora]
And...


14 :
Sora continued her explanation.

She said the special wavelength of light was
infrared and around 850 nanometers.

And that ordinary people couldn't see infrared
light.

She went on to say that if a person was able
to see infrared, they would even be able to see
in the dark.

But that they could only see objects that
emitted heat.

Put another way, objects that gave off heat
also emitted infrared rays.

And if you could see infrared rays, then you
could tell the temperature of something
without having to touch it...


15 :

{S6A042}
[Sora]
"You would not be able to see this image 
unless you can see infrared light."


{S6A043}
[Sora]
"The fact that you can see this image means 
that you can see infrared light, Kid-san."

[Kid]
"But... what about Sara? Does that mean that 
Sara can too?"


16 :

{S6A044}
[Sora]
"Yes. Both of you have a very unique ability 
to see infrared light."

Thinking back on it, that probably explained
why Takeshi and Y工 couldn't see the image in
the pendant.

[Kid]
But... why was this hologram in my finger...?

I trembled as I said that.

[Kid]
It's the same image as in Sara's pendant...

[Kid]
"Are you saying that the missing piece of that 
pendant has been in my thumb?"


17 :

{S6A045}
[Sora]
That is the only conceivable explanation.


{S6A046}
[Sora]
"The surface and shape of the fragment match 
the pendant perfectly."

[Kid]
But... why...?


18 :

{S6A047}
[Sora]
That... Kid-san...


19 :

{S6A048}
[Sora]
Is because you and Matsunaga-san are siblings.

[Kid]
What? It can't be!


20 :

{S6A049}
[Sora]
"It is the same reason that you both have the 
ability to see infrared light."


{S6A050}
[Sora]
"It is probably because you both carry the 
same genes."

[Kid]
No...

[Kid]
No... No... No...


21 :

{S6A051}
[Sora]
Kid-san. Why wouldn't that make you happy?


22 :

{S6A052}
[Sora]
You have found a blood relative.


{S6A053}
[Sora]
"Is there any better way possible to recover 
your memory?"

[Kid]
No... No...

I held my head and crouched down.


23 :

{S6A054}
[Sora]
"In either case, it is a fact and you should 
accept it."


{S6A055}
[Sora]
"While you two were asleep, I performed a DNA 
analysis on both of you."


{S6A056}
[Sora]
The results are indicated on the display.


{S6A057}
[Sora]
"The probability that you are brother and 
sister is... nearly 100%."

[Kid]
"No... No... No... No... No... No... 
No... No... No... No... No... No...!"


24 :
Suddenly, the wall to my memory that I had
tried so hard to destroy, but I had been
unable to breach, crumbled.

Like a dam that was holding back the overflow
of my memory, it burst, unleashing a torrent
of images that flooded into my mind.

[Kid]
Uggghhh...

Memories of my life, in no apparent order,
flashed across my mind like random slides
appearing on a screen.

From one to the next, they floated up and
vanished.

My mind couldn't handle the flood of memories.


25 :
And then came the darkness...

I heard a lullaby coming from somewhere...


26 :
I groggily opened my eyes.

I was lying on a hard bed.


27 :
I heard a voice crying from outside.


28 :
There was a girl surrounded by a group of
bullies in an open space.

It was Sara.

The kids were being cruel, jeering at her and
making fun of her in only the way that kids
could.

I ran up to Sara.


29 :
The bullies scattered like baby spiders
in the wind.

Sara said that her precious pendant
had been broken.

Sara clutched the pendant firmly in her hand.


I bent over to pick up the fragment from it.


30 :
I felt a sudden shock from behind.

I was plunged forward.

With a sharp pain, the shard was buried in my
thumb.


31 :
The kids that always bullied Sara had
encircled us.

The laughter and howls of our tormentors
echoed around us.

[Kid]
You bullies! How could you do this to Sara!?

Forgetting myself, I lunged at the mob of kids.


32 :
They beat me mercilessly, and as I lay on the
ground in that open space, I faced skyward.

Satisfied with what they had done to me, the
bullies had left.

Sara came and held out her hands to me.


{S6A062}
[Sara]
You're so brave, onii-chan.

She smiled as she said it.


33 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}


{16:0x}Even though I lost.{16:1}

{16:4}


34 :
Blood continued to drip from my finger.

Not wanting to worry Sara, I pretended that
everything was fine and dismissed it as
nothing.

I didn't say anything to our teacher.

I didn't go to the doctor. I just silently
endured the pain.

It seemed to me that to tell someone of it
would that mean I had lost.

In time, the wound closed up...

One day, a nice lady in a suit came.


She told us there was a place we could go
where things would be better.


Saying that, the lady held out her hand.

We could see things that other people
couldn't.

At first, we thought our abilities were normal,
but everyone had shunned us.

The lady said she wanted to study us.

I decided to go along with the idea.

Our caretakers at the orphanage we lived in
were happy to see us leave because they thought
we were troublemakers.

We fell right into their trap.


35 :
They locked us in a small hospital room.

Day in and day out, we were marched from that
room to the research institute.

At night, moonlight would stream in from the
lone window.

The only things I remembered were the Leiblich
logos on the doors we passed every day.

And the white frocks of the research employees.

And every night, the voice of Sara crying in
the room next to me...


36 :
One day, there was something in the air that
was different from other days.

We were taken from our rooms and led to a
research office in a different area.

People who I'd never seen before took me away.


37 :
Sara alone was left there.


{S6A063}
[Sara]
Onii-chan!

I could hear Sara's screams.

I shook off the adult hands and ran to where
Sara was.

The researchers tried to block my path.

[Kid]
Sara!


{S6A064}
[Sara]
Onii-chan!


38 :
[Kid]
Sara! Wait for me!

[Kid]
"I'll come back for you. I promise, I will 
come find you!"

[Kid]
Be a good girl and wait for me!


39 :

{S6A065}
[Sara]
I'll be good and wait for you...


{S6A066}
[Sara]
"But come for sure. You come to get me for 
sure. Okay?"


{S6A067}
[Sara]
I'll wait... I'll wait forever!


40 :
{1}

{16:0x}I had promised.{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}That was how things were.{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}Back then, I had promised.{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}I had promised to go get her.{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}But... I hadn't gone.{16:1}

{1}

{16:0x}I couldn't go.{16:1}

{16:4}

41 :
I was moved to another facility and taken to
a new home after a while.

My foster parents were good people.

They were good to me if I didn't get out of
line.

But... they had sold their souls to (and were
controlled by) Leiblich.

I passed my time under their forgiving but
ever-present eyes unable to search
for Sara.

Still, there were times when I did my best
to find leads to her.

But I didn't even know where the research
facility was, and something would always get
in my way, and after a while I couldn't search
anymore.

I just hadn't been able to help Sara with
my limited powers.

But... no matter what excuses I came up with,
the result was the same.

I had abandoned Sara.

In the isolated clinic room into which the
cold moonlight shined.


42 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{16:0x}I couldn't keep... my promise...{16:1}

{16:4}

43 :
Even then, Sara was on the other side
of the door...

I knew that she was still waiting for me in
that miserable little room.

Still believing in me...

Just as I had promised.

The sense of guilt I felt overpowered me.

It left me with an agonizing sense of
hopelessness.

And utter despair.


44 :
{1}{1}

{16:0}There was nothing I could do!{16:1}

{16:0}I didn't have any other choice!{16:1}

{16:0}What else could I have done!?{16:1}

{16:4}

45 :
When I opened my eyes, I was lying on a bed in
the infirmary.

I didn't know if someone had brought me there
or I had dragged myself unconsciously.

I looked at my watch without thinking.

Not much time had elapsed since I had
passed out.

Lying on the bed, I looked up at the ceiling
and thought about the events leading up to
that point.

The reason I had known that it was too hot
inside the generator room was my infrared
vision.

And the 'moonlight' coming from the inverter
unit had been the same thing.

In the darkness, I had mistaken the heat from
the inverter as moonlight.

And the shock that I felt when I met Sara
made sense too.

We were siblings, after all.

I had probably known it in the back of my mind
even without my memory.

That was why... the first time I had seen Sara...

And why had she grasped my thumb in the
darkness?

Why had she sung that lullaby that time?


46 :

{S4A079}
[Sara]
Really? You don't know it?


47 :

{S4A080}
[Sara]
Oh, I see... That's right...


48 :
It seemed to me that Sara had probably noticed.

That we were brother and sister...

So...

I raised myself up.

Sara was still asleep in the bed next to me.

I stood next to Sara's pillow and stared down
at her face.

My memory was still a little jumbled, but
there was no mistaking that face.

It was Sara.

Little Sara had grown to be sixteen.

It had to be her.

I was sure it was Sara.

The sister that I had made a promise to find
but then broken it...

I felt so guilty and ashamed. I couldn't
look at Sara's face.

It was hard just being there.

I didn't know what to say to Sara.

What excuses could I make to her?

No matter what I said to her, it would all
ring hollow.

I wanted to get out of there before Sara
woke up.

I walked toward the door.


49 :

{S6A068}
[Sara]
Onii... chan?

With her voice, my legs stopped.

I didn't have the courage to turn around.


{S6A069}
[Sara]
You... You are my onii-chan, right?

Sara continued talking.

Each of her words was like a stab in the heart.


{S6A070}
[Sara]
Onii-chan?


50 :
[Kid]
No!

I spit out the words without thinking.


{S6A071}
[Sara]
Huh...?

[Kid]
You're wrong... about me.


{S6A072}
[Sara]
That... can't be.


{S6A073}
[Sara]
You are my onii-chan, right?

[Kid]
No!

I sensed that Sara was about to get up from
the bed so I tried to leave.


{S6A074}
[Sara]
Wait!


{S6A075}
[Sara]
Onii-chan, wait!

Her voice sounded just like when she had cried
out to me when she was a child, and I froze,
unable to move.


{S6A076}
[Sara]
You're my onii-chan... You are, aren't you?

[Kid]
.........

Sara grabbed my shoulders.


{S6A077}
[Sara]
Hey, why don't you say something? Look at me!


51 :
Sara circled around in front of me, all the
time holding my shoulders.

But I couldn't bear to look Sara in the face
and turned away.


{S6A078}
[Sara]
Hey... Why won't you look at me?


{S6A079}
[Sara]
Hey, look at me.


{S6A080}
[Sara]
I said look at me!

[Kid]
No, no, no!

I shook off Sara's hands.


52 :

{S6A081}
[Sara]
Aaah!

[Kid]
Sara!


53 :
Sara threw her arms around me, hugging me
tightly.

Sara's eyes stared directly at me.


54 :

{S6A082}
[Sara]
Why? Why are you denying me?


{S6A083}
[Sara]
"You're my onii-chan, right? You are, aren't 
you?"

[Kid]
No, no. I'm...


{S6A084}
[Sara]
Why not? I know you are!


{S6A085}
[Sara]
Onii-chan... You're my onii-chan...!


{S6A086}
[Sara]
I waited for you. I waited and waited!


{S6A087}
[Sara]
I waited forever for you to come!


{S6A088}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...


55 :
Sara fell to the ground, and I said nothing
to her.

I just ran out of the room.

That was right, I ran away.

I ran from Sara and from my past...


56 :
I squatted in the small room in the back of
the warehouse.

All I could do was just keep running away from
Sara and my past.

I was such a coward.

Overcome by the memories that had come rushing
back to me, I had run away from my sister...

I couldn't even accept my own weakness.

I denied myself. It was less scary than
acknowledging what I had done.

I... I... I was such a coward.

Had I known that would happen... I would have
never wanted my memory back...

Things were better when I didn't remember
anything...

Crouched there in the corner, I was paralyzed.

I couldn't face Sara... My own sister... All I
could do was let the time pass by.

...


57 :
My memory had been completely restored apart
from recent events.

I knew my age, address, and phone number...

I also remembered my foster mother and father.

Still... there was just one crucial thing that
I couldn't remember.

{16:4}

58 :
{1}

{16:0}That was...{16:1}

{16:0}My name...{16:1}

{16:0}What was my name?{16:1}

{16:0}What was I called?{16:1}

{16:0}I didn't know.{16:1}

{16:4}

59 :
Why was that the only thing that I couldn't
remember?

As long as I couldn't remember that, I felt
incomplete.

As if the essence of my existence were
concentrated into my name.

As long as I couldn't remember my name,
I couldn't feel whole.

That was how I felt.

No matter how much else I remembered, that one
point escaped me.

Then I thought back... about what it was that
had made me lose my memory.

The massive guilt I felt toward Sara...

I wondered if that was why I had repressed
my memory.

But there was too much about that theory that
didn't make sense.

I had lost my memory before meeting Sara... and
before the accident at LeMU.

And I couldn't remember what I was doing just
before then or why I had come to LeMU.


It might have been that I had seen Sara at
LeMU... and then it had happened...

But something didn't seem right about that
either.

I couldn't imagine why only my name and recent
events wouldn't come back to me.

I had already remembered Sara...

It would make sense for me to remember
everything.

I wondered what kind of amnesia... it
might have been...


60 :
A sudden sound and shaking made me look up.


61 :
The next instant, warning alarms started
shrieking.

All around me, the squeal of straining
metal echoed from the structure.

The shaking continued on and off.

Wh-what...

I ran out of the room.


62 :
Water?

I noticed something strange as I emerged in
the corridor.

Water was flowing in.

I couldn't believe that water could have
reached there.


63 :

{S6A089}
[Y工]
Kid!

[Kid]
Y工, what is this? Did something happen!?


{S6A090}
[Y工]
"I'll explain later. For now, just hurry over 
here."

[Kid]
Wh-what?


{S6A091}
[Y工]
I found an exit we can escape through!

[Kid]
Where?


{S6A092}
[Y工]
I'll explain later, just hurry!


64 :
With those words of encouragement, Y工 started
running.


65 :
She turned the corner, heading for stairs
leading to an emergency corridor.

[Kid]
What about everybody else?


{S6A093}
[Y工]
"Kuranari is going to get Mayo. Tsugumi is 
already at the emergency corridor."

We dashed toward the stairs to the emergency
corridor.


66 :
And climbed up to it.

Takeshi, Tsugumi, and Sara were already
gathered there.


67 :

{S6A094}
[Takeshi]
Hurry, we don't have much time.

[Kid]
What happened?


68 :

{S6A095}
[Takeshi]
Just hurry.


69 :
Saying that, he started running ahead of
everyone else.

Tsugumi followed suit.


70 :

{S6A096}
[Y工]
Listen. LeMU is already starting to collapse.


71 :
Y工 pushed on my back.

I started running.


{S6A097}
[Y工]
"We were finally able to make contact with 
the surface, and now the emergency stairs 
are accessible."


{S6A098}
[Y工]
"But if we don't hurry, they're going to 
flood."


{S6A099}
[Y工]
So just hurry.

Y工 explained the situation from behind me.

I followed Takeshi and Tsugumi as we sprinted
the distance of the emergency stairs.


72 :
We soon reached the stairs.

Takeshi and Tsugumi were already climbing.


{S6A100}
[Takeshi]
Hurry! This way!

Takeshi's voice rang down from above.

I ran, following the sound of their footsteps.

As we were trying to escape, LeMU began to
shake and screech as metal clashed with metal.

But we just kept climbing, moving toward the
top.

Only the sound of everyone's labored breathing
and running footsteps echoed throughout
the emergency stairs.

...


{S6A101}
[Takeshi]
Just a little more! We're almost there!

Takeshi shouted up ahead.

Takeshi's voice was full of hope.

It was then that we realized it.


{S6A102}
[Y工]
Mayo... Mayo... Mayo isn't here!

Y工 shouted that.


73 :
[Kid]
Huh?


{S6A103}
[Takeshi]
What'd you say?


74 :
I stopped and looked back.

Y工 stood on the stairs, stunned and looking
downward.


{S6A104}
[Y工]
What happened? She was right behind me!


75 :

{S6A105}
[Takeshi]
What happened?

Takeshi and the others came down the stairs.


76 :

{S6A106}
[Y工]
Kuranari, Mayo... Mayo isn't here!


77 :

{S6A107}
[Takeshi]
"God damn it... Didn't you check to see that 
she was behind you?"


78 :

{S6A108}
[Y工]
She was right behind me from the start!


{S6A109}
[Y工]
Partway up, I got so into climbing...


79 :
The stairs shook violently, and there was a
large sound.

At the same time, the lights that dimly lit
the stairs went out.


80 :

{S6A110}
[Takeshi]
Damn! A blackout. We can't go back now.


{S6A111}
[Takeshi]
If we double back, everyone's a goner!


81 :

{S6A112}
[Y工]
But!

[Kid]
I'll go.


82 :

{S6A113}
[Y工]
Huh?

[Kid]
I'll go back. Everybody keep going.


83 :
Without waiting for a reply, I started rushing
down the stairs I had just climbed.


{S6A114}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Kid!


{S6A115}
[Y工]
"It's impossible! It's already starting to 
flood. What do you think you're going to do?"

Their voices rang out behind me.

[Kid]
Swim!


{S6A116}
[Y工]
It's pitch black below!

[Kid]
No problem!

[Kid]
I can see!

I could actually see the different parts of
the stairs by their different temperatures.

It was the first time that I had ever been
thankful for my unusual vision.


84 :
I went down the stairs and came out at Zweiter
Stock's emergency corridor.

It looked like the emergency power had
already died.

I wondered where Sara might be.

I thought frantically.

If she had turned back partway, then she
probably wouldn't have made it to Dritter Stock.

But I couldn't be sure.

If she had gone all the way down to Dritter
Stock...

...Then I would never make it in time if I
looked around Zweiter Stock first.

I didn't know what to do...

I had to decided whether I would start
looking on Dritter Stock or from Zweiter Stock...

85 :
{11:0-1c}
{11:1}Start with Dritter Stock

{11:1}Start with Zweiter Stock


86 :
I decided to start searching from Dritter Stock.

I figured the water pressure would be higher
there, and the flooding more serious.

If she was in Dritter Stock, then I'd have to
start there to have any hope of finding her.

I headed down the stairs to Dritter Stock.


87 :
Reaching the emergency corridor, I arrived at
Dritter Stock.


If Sara was there, where would she be...?

The conference room or the control room?

Or could she have been at one of the
attractions?

I didn't have much time.

Peering down through the emergency hatch, I
realized that the flooding had already
progressed a lot.

It seemed best to check each room from the
emergency corridor rather than going all
the way down.

I wondered if Sara really was on that floor...


But having come so far, I knew there was no
going back.

I ran through the emergency corridor.


88 :
I exited on the emergency corridor furthest
outside.

Opening the emergency hatch to each room,
I peeked inside.

If Sara was there, I'd be able to see her
body heat.

I looked in the conference room and the
control room, but there was no sign of her
there. The water only continued to rise.


89 :
The doors beyond the elevator hall didn't open.

I frantically ran down the emergency corridor,
moving from one attraction to the next.


90 :
I checked the rest area and then looked down
into the Lemurian Ruins, but Sara wasn't there.

Maybe she wasn't on that floor...?

The sound of the water and shaking of the
structure both continued to intensify.

If I didn't hurry, I wouldn't make it back to
Zweiter Stock.

I knew I had to hurry to the emergency stairs.


91 :
I sprinted to the stairs and up to Zweiter Stock.

I had lost a lot of time.

I had to hurry.


92 :
Finally, I arrived back at Zweiter Stock.

LeMU was shaking terribly, and the area below
the emergency hatch had already filled with
water.

It looked like water was about to flood into
the corridor.

I plunged into the water.


93 :
Swimming desperately to the security office, I
forgot the pain in my arm and looked inside.

Sara wasn't there.

I was able to steal a breath using the air at
the top of the room.

(Where could... Sara... be...?)

I dove into the water again and swam for the
infirmary.

The infirmary door was open.

I looked inside.


94 :
...Sara!

Sara's body stood out white in the dark water.

That room also had a pocket of air near
the ceiling.

Sara was just barely floating there.

I floated to the surface.


95 :
No, I thought Sara was somewhere in
Zweiter Stock.

I didn't know why, but I was sure of it.

She was probably somewhere in Zweiter Stock...

I knew it might be a meaningless hunch.

But maybe it was our sibling bond talking
to me.

Sara and I had the same blood in our veins.

That was my thinking.

It was probably my imagination, but it was all
I had to bet on.


96 :
I opened the emergency hatch and saw that
water had already covered three-quarters of
the corridor.

Without hesitating, I threw myself in.

The water flowed unpredictably, with
whirlpools forming in various places.

I endured the pain in my right arm and swam
desperately.

First, I looked in the security office.

There was no source of heat that looked
like Sara.

From there I made for the warehouse,
but Sara wasn't there.

I checked the merry-go-round, but she
wasn't there either.

Ahead of me was the elevator hall. Again,
no Sara.

I swam back up the corridor.

Water had completely covered the entrance
to the infirmary.

I took a breath and dove underwater.

I put my hand on the door and peered inside.

And there...


97 :
...Was Sara.

Sara's body heat made her stand out brightly
against the cool, surrounding darkness.

I went into the infirmary and floated to the
surface.

Sara looked surprised when I broke through
to the surface.


{S6A117}
[Sara]
Kid... I mean, onii-chan.

[Kid]
Sara... You're alright.


{S6A118}
[Sara]
Why are you...?

[Kid]
I promised, didn't I?

[Kid]
I told you that I'd come find you, didn't I?
