1 :
[Kid]
It's raining...

I was sitting at the tip of the whale's nose.

Sara was beside me.

She covered her head with her hand to keep
the droplets from getting her hair wet.


2 :

{C4A000}
[Sara]
Rain?


{C4A001}
[Sara]
You know it's not rain, don't you?


3 :

{C4A002}
[Sara]
It's just the whale blowing out water.

[Kid]
I know that.


4 :
[Kid]
"I know that, but it looks like it's raining to 
me."


5 :
Water, misty and drizzling, poured upon us
from the sky.

The stars reflected lights from the water
droplets and emitted vibrant colors.

We were in the cosmos.

The whale was alive.

At least it seemed that way to me.

A whale swimming in the starry sky.

Its back surging like a wave, it undulated
again and again.

Its soft mouth opened, closed, and even
puffed up from time to time.

About every three minutes, it blew out a warm
breath through its blowhole.

A seawater mist of spray would scatter around
the area.

Sitting at the tip of its nose, Sara and I
bobbed up and down in time with its
movements...

However, the whale undulated so slowly that we
could let go with our hands and feel safe.


It was like a cradle rocking back and forth...

On the back of the whale, we sailed through
the cosmos.


6 :

{C4A003}
[Sara]
Hey, Kid?


{C4A004}
[Sara]
"Actually, there's something I've been wanting 
to ask you..."

[Kid]
Yeah? What's that?


{C4A005}
[Sara]
"Kid, you remember when we had a blackout, 
don't you?"

[Kid]
Sure.

[Kid]
"Yesterday... No, wait. Since we already passed 
midnight, I guess it was the day before 
yesterday, wasn't it?"

[Kid]
"You mean the blackout from two days ago, 
right?"


{C4A006}
[Sara]
Yeah.


{C4A007}
[Sara]
"When Nakkyu tried to open the door to the 
generator room... you stopped her, right?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


{C4A008}
[Sara]
How come? Why did you stop her?

[Kid]
I don't really know what to say...

[Kid]
"I said the same thing then, but I thought it 
would be dangerous for her to open the door..."


{C4A009}
[Sara]
Really? Is that all?

[Kid]
Um... Uh-huh...


{C4A010}
[Sara]
Then how about this?


{C4A011}
[Sara]
Can you see what's in this?


7 :
Muttering, Sara gently removed something from
her pocket.

‡LShick.

A flame appeared.


8 :
The whole scene changed in an instant as
Sara's face lit up in red.

I realized that what Sara had taken out was a
pendant and a lighter.

[Sara]
I don't really know what to say...

Without saying a word, Sara brought the flame
and the pendant in front of my eyes.


9 :
Inside the pendant floated a holographic
image of a man who I had never seen before.

[Kid]
Who is this?

When I asked that, Sara's hand began to quiver.

The flame shook.

The large shadow that it projected on the
wall flickered as well.


{C4A012}
[Sara]
So...


{C4A013}
[Sara]
You can see it too...


10 :
Sara held the pendant closer and stared at
the image inside it.

[Kid]
Hey, whose image is that?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
You're not going to tell me?

[Sara]
.........

Sara looked up to the starry sky.

She stared at the back of the whale for a while,
the pendant held tightly in her hand. Finally,
she glanced slightly upward into my eyes.

There was a long silence.

Sara looked deep in thought, or maybe as
though she wasn't thinking anything...


The only sound was her steady measured breaths.


Eventually...


{C4A014}
[Sara]
He's a person from the sun.

Sara whispered.

[Kid]
A person from the sun?


{C4A015}
[Sara]
Yeah.

[Kid]
Hey, can I see that?

I took the pendant and the lighter from her
and checked the image again.


11 :
Sara took the lighter from her pocket and lit
it.

The shimmering flame colored her face red.

She had the pendant in her other hand.

The pendant was shaking in Sara's small hand.

It was the same one she had shown me in the
small room in the warehouse.

[Kid]
"Hey, Sara? I'm going to ask you again, 
but..."

[Kid]
Who is the man in the pendant?


{C4A016}
[Sara]
And I already told you, right?

[Kid]
What, that he's from the sun?


{C4A017}
[Sara]
Yep...

She handed me the pendant and the lighter, and
I stared closely at the image.


12 :
It went without saying, but he seemed to look
like a normal person.

I had no idea how people from the sun were
supposed to look, but the man in the image at
least had the face of an 'earthling'.

He looked like any ordinary young man to me.


13 :
[Kid]
Are you serious? He's from the sun?

I asked her.


{C4A018}
[Sara]
Haha... You're so gullible, Kid.

[Kid]
What?


{C4A019}
[Sara]
There's no such thing as people from the sun.


{C4A020}
[Sara]
"Do you honestly think life could exist on 
that ball of fire?"

[Kid]
So you were lying to me?


14 :
[Kid]
Are you serious? He's from the sun?

I asked her.


{C4A018}
[Sara]
Haha... You're so gullible, Kid.

[Kid]
What?


{C4A019}
[Sara]
There's no such thing as people from the sun.


{C4A020}
[Sara]
"Do you honestly think life could exist on 
that ball of fire?"

[Kid]
So you were lying to me?


15 :

{C4A021}
[Sara]
"I wouldn't call it lying. I was joking with 
you. You know, giving you a hard time."

[Kid]
What's that supposed to mean?


{C4A022}
[Sara]
Well, what do you think it means?

[Kid]
?

Sara stretched out her arm and put out the
lighter.

‡LClick.


16 :
The darkness spread across the cosmos.

I put the lighter and the pendant together,
returning them to her.

Just then, Sara slid down the back of the
whale without a word.

I hastily followed suit.


17 :

{C4A023}
[Sara]
"You can only see the image when you're 
outside."


{C4A024}
[Sara]
"It's made in a way so that it's only visible 
under sunlight."


{C4A025}
[Sara]
That's why I said he was a person from the sun.

Sara stood next to the whale and started
talking.


{C4A026}
[Sara]
When I was young, I really believed it.


{C4A027}
[Sara]
"I used to believe that you can only see it 
with sunlight because it was made by people 
who lived on the sun."


{C4A028}
[Sara]
"And that because I had this pendant, I was 
one of their children..."


{C4A029}
[Sara]
"And that I was sent to Earth on some kind of 
mission... I used to imagine stuff like that."


{C4A030}
[Sara]
"Looking back on it now, I know those were 
really just childish fantasies."

[Kid]
W-wait a second, Sara.

[Kid]
We're 51 meters underwater. Where is the sun...?

‡LShick.


18 :
Sara interrupted me and lit the lighter.


Light filled the space around us.

The flickering flame...

Despite its insignificant size, a madder red the
color of a sunset shined upon the dome-shaped
ceiling.


{C4A031}
[Sara]
A flame.


{C4A032}
[Sara]
"Even without the sun, you can see it if 
you've got a lighter."


{C4A033}
[Sara]
It took me a long time to realize it, though.


{C4A034}
[Sara]
I guess I was ten or eleven, or so...

[Kid]
Really, sunlight or a flame, huh...?


{C4A035}
[Sara]
But still...


{C4A036}
[Sara]
"Even if there is sunlight or flame, there 
are some people who can't see it."

[Kid]
People who can't see it?


{C4A037}
[Sara]
Meaning pretty much everybody except me.


{C4A038}
[Sara]
"I'm the only person I've found who can see 
this hologram's image."


{C4A039}
[Sara]
Well...


{C4A040}
[Sara]
I THOUGHT I was the only one who could see it.


19 :

{C4A041}
[Sara]
"But now... I guess it seems like there's 
someone else..."


20 :

{C4A042}
[Sara]
"But you know, I just met someone who can 
also see this image..."


21 :
Sara put out the lighter. The darkness came
rushing back.


22 :
She flicked the light on again, then put it out.

Lit it and put it out, lit it and put it out...
Finally, Sara spoke.


{C4A043}
[Sara]
Kid...


{C4A044}
[Sara]
I'm talking about you.

My scar ached.

The old scar on my left thumb...


{C4A045}
[Sara]
Why is it?


{C4A046}
[Sara]
How come you can you see it too, Kid?


{C4A047}
[Sara]
Huh? Why do you think so?

Sara looked upward into my eyes.

She pushed the pendant and the lighter
against my chest.


{C4A048}
[Sara]
Will you look at it again?


23 :
I took them from her.


24 :
Striking the flame, I looked closer at the
pendant.

A weak 3D image rose dimly before me...

It was a man who I hadn't even seen before...

Looking at it that closely, I realized that a piece from
the mirror was missing.

A scar on my thumb... 'A piece to be
filled in'...

I started to suspect the truth of the matter.


{C4A049}
[Sara]
Do you remember anything?


{C4A050}
[Sara]
Does anything about this ring a bell?

[Kid]
No, not really...

I was starting to realize, but I shook my head.

My scar was itching as if an electric current
were running through it.


{C4A051}
[Sara]
Oh...

Sara dropped her shoulders in disappointment.


{C4A052}
[Sara]
The man in the image?


{C4A053}
[Sara]
I have a feeling... he's my dad.

[Kid]
...What?

[Kid]
You think he's your father?


{C4A054}
[Sara]
Yeah...


{C4A055}
[Sara]
Me and...


{C4A056}
[Sara]
My onii-chan's...


{C4A057}
[Sara]
Dad...


25 :

{C4A058}
[£o¢o]
Daddy! Daddddyyyy!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C4A059}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Daaaaaaad!

[Takeshi]
.........


{C4A060}
[£o¢o]
Daddy, why won't you listen to me?

[Takeshi]
Well, let me tell you.

[Takeshi]
Because I'm NOT your dad, that's why.


26 :

{C4A061}
[£o¢o]
"A girl who doesn't have a daddy can call 
somebody who reminds her of daddy 'Daddy.'"


{C4A062}
[£o¢o]
"It's written in the preamble of the 
Constitution, isn't it?"

[Takeshi]
"You don't saaaay... Well, I've got three 
things to tell you."

[Takeshi]
"First: As far as I know, not one line in the 
Japanese constitution corresponds to what you 
just said."

[Takeshi]
Second: I'm not even close to being fatherly.

[Takeshi]
"Third: You've already got a dad‡Lwho is 
still alive and well."

[Takeshi]
So stop calling me daddy, £o¢o.


27 :

{C4A063}
[£o¢o]
Oh, c'mon~


{C4A064}
[£o¢o]
I wanna call you daddy! Come on, can't I?

[Takeshi]
Forget it.

[Takeshi]
"I'm already taking a big hit with this stupid 
nickname 'Takepyon'. Don't make me put up with 
another one like 'daddy' on top of that."


28 :

{C4A065}
[£o¢o]
Oh, you're so mean... Daddy!

[Takeshi]
I told you NOT to call me daddy!


{C4A066}
[£o¢o]
Grr...

£o¢o growled as she glared at me.

[Takeshi]
Grr...

But I wasn't going to give in either.

£o¢o and I stood face-to-face with each
other, both on the verge of an outburst.

As we stood there, I just couldn't help
thinking to myself.

How in the world did I end up in such a
situation...?


29 :
It had all happened 30 minutes earlier.


{C4A067}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon, Takepyon~


{C4A068}
[£o¢o]
Wake up~


{C4A069}
[£o¢o]
I can't go to sleep~


{C4A070}
[£o¢o]
Come play with me~

While saying that...

£o¢o shook my body hard, pried open my
eyelids, poured saltwater into my eyes, and even
shoved hydrogen peroxide up my nose.

Giving in to her dogged persistence, I
reluctantly decided to keep her company.


30 :

{C4A071}
[£o¢o]
Grr...

£o¢o was still growling at me.


{C4A072}
[£o¢o]
You're going to let me call you Daddy~

She was just being outrageous.


31 :

{C4A073}
[£o¢o]
If you won't, I'm gonna bite you~


32 :

{C4A074}
[£o¢o]
*Munch*.

£o¢o chomped down on my arm.

[Takeshi]
"Ooooouuuch! I can't believe you actually bit 
me!"

I forcefully pried her face off of my arm.


33 :
There were teeth marks on my arm, and the area
started to turn a purplish red.


{C4A075}
[£o¢o]
Well, believe it!


34 :

{C4A076}
[£o¢o]
Uheeheeheehee~

£o¢o covered her mouth with her fist and
giggled triumphantly.

[Takeshi]
"Why on earth do you want to call me 'daddy' 
anyway?"


35 :

{C4A077}
[£o¢o]
Because you seem like the daddy type to me.

[Takeshi]
"You're telling me, after you trapped me 
into this, that a 20-year-old guy like me 
seems like the 'daddy type'? You telling me I 
look old?"


{C4A078}
[£o¢o]
Nope.


{C4A079}
[£o¢o]
I just kind of thought you did, somehow.

[Takeshi]
'Somehow', huh...?

[Takeshi]
"Well then, are you trying to say that your 
dad and I are alike?"


36 :

{C4A080}
[£o¢o]
Nope, not at all.


{C4A081}
[£o¢o]
"My dad is a lot better-looking than you. 
Smarter too."


37 :
I should have been yelling at her by then,
but I just couldn't bring myself to get angry
with her.

Because all the while, £o¢o was dancing around
like crazy, shaking her hips and waving her
arms in front of me.

I guess you could say I was too distracted to
be angry with her.

[Takeshi]
"By the way... you said your dad is on a 
'business trip' right now, didn't you?"


38 :

{C4A082}
[£o¢o]
Yeah.

[Takeshi]
Where did he go?


{C4A083}
[£o¢o]
"He's at a research laboratory under the 
ocean."

[Takeshi]
A research laboratory under the ocean?


{C4A084}
[£o¢o]
"There's a research laboratory called EBF or 
something down below LeMU."


{C4A085}
[£o¢o]
My dad is a researcher there.


39 :

{C4A086}
[£o¢o]
"Oh, but... you've got to keep it a secret, 
okay?"

I didn't know why, but for some reason, it
didn't surprise me.

As a matter of fact, it seemed perfectly
logical to me.

It felt... as if I'd already known about it.

It was just a feeling, but...

[Takeshi]
"Then... you must be worried, right...? I mean, 
about your dad."

I asked £o¢o.


40 :

{C4A087}
[£o¢o]
Why?

[Takeshi]
Well... Um... I mean...


41 :

{C4A088}
[£o¢o]
Oh, I got it!


{C4A089}
[£o¢o]
"You thought my dad might be trapped here 
just like us, didn't you?"

[Takeshi]
.........


{C4A090}
[£o¢o]
But don't worry. He's fine.


{C4A091}
[£o¢o]
I know he got out safely.

[Takeshi]
What...? How do you know that?


{C4A092}
[£o¢o]
I just do.


{C4A093}
[£o¢o]
Because I'm psyyyychic.

[Takeshi]
...What?


{C4A094}
[£o¢o]
"Well, it's kind like of telepathy, or 
clairvoyance, or precognition, or postcognition..."

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


42 :

{C4A095}
[£o¢o]
Anyway, my dad's okay.


{C4A096}
[£o¢o]
I can just feel it.

£o¢o had a big smile on her face.

She was still performing her wacky dance.


43 :

{C4A097}
[£o¢o]
What else... Oh yeah, I can bend spoons too.


{C4A098}
[£o¢o]
"I tell a spoon to, like, 'Come on, just give 
in and bend!', and it does."

[Takeshi]
Oh... I see...


{C4A099}
[£o¢o]
"Do you wanna know why I can do that kind of 
stuff?"

[Takeshi]
.........


44 :

{C4A100}
[£o¢o]
"I'm actually a Solarian, a person from the 
sun~"


{C4A101}
[£o¢o]
A Solarian is born with psychic abilities.


{C4A102}
[£o¢o]
That's why.


45 :

{C4A103}
[£o¢o]
But my dad and mom are earthlings.


{C4A104}
[£o¢o]
I'm the only Solarian here.

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see... Wow, that's great.

I couldn't find anything else to say.

The powerful microwaves that £o¢o produced had
shaken my brain and fried it.

My consciousness started becoming hazy, as if
I had been in bed for three days with a high
fever.


{C4A105}
[£o¢o]
I love the sun because I'm a Solarian~


{C4A106}
[£o¢o]
"When I bathe in the rays from my homeland, I 
get all warm and toasty inside."


46 :

{C4A107}
[£o¢o]
Aaaah, I wish I could see the sun...


{C4A108}
[£o¢o]
I wish I could sunbathe...

[Takeshi]
.........


47 :

{C4A109}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon? I wanna go sunbathe!

[Takeshi]
Well, that's kind of hard to do right now.


48 :

{C4A110}
[£o¢o]
I know... but I want to!


{C4A111}
[£o¢o]
"We haven't seen the sun for three days, you 
know?"


{C4A112}
[£o¢o]
Don't you wanna sunbathe, Takepyon?

[Takeshi]
Ummm.

I tried to imagine.

A high, clear blue sky... A nice May
breeze... The horizon... The sun shimmering on
the ocean surface...

It had only been three days, but for some
reason, the scenery from the world outside
felt far away.

I couldn't wait to go outside.

Outside... to the surface...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah, now that you mention it, I do want to 
sunbathe."


49 :
[Takeshi]
But we just don't have that option right now.


50 :
[Takeshi]
Besides, it's midnight anyway...


51 :

{C4A113}
[£o¢o]
Noooooooo!


{C4A114}
[£o¢o]
I wanna sunbathe! I wanna, I wanna!

[Takeshi]
Alright, we can do it tomorrow.

[Takeshi]
"Someone will probably have rescued us by then 
anyway."


{C4A115}
[£o¢o]
No, I want to do it right now! Right now!


{C4A116}
[£o¢o]
Sunbathe, sunbathe, sunbathe!

[Takeshi]
£o¢o!

There was no way I was going to let that
outburst go.

I gave her a look that said, 'I'm about to get
angry.'

And £o¢o responded with...


52 :

{C4A117}
[£o¢o]
Ooooh... Oh, alright...


{C4A118}
[£o¢o]
I won't ask anymore...

Her shoulders drooped sadly.


{C4A119}
[£o¢o]
Instead, let's...

[Takeshi]
Instead, let's what...?


53 :

{C4A120}
[£o¢o]
Let's play 'chicks'!

[Takeshi]
Uhhh... What?


54 :

{C4A121}
[£o¢o]
Play 'chicks'! Play 'chicks'! Pi-yo-pi-yo~


55 :

{C4A122}
[£o¢o]
Play 'chicks'! Play 'chicks'! Pu-pu-pu-pu~

[Takeshi]
"Ummm, Earth to £o¢o... Would you mind 
telling me what you're talking about?"


56 :

{C4A123}
[£o¢o]
Okay, I'll explain!


{C4A124}
[£o¢o]
"Playing 'chicks' is an elegant, aristocratic 
game developed in 1648 by Louis XIV of 
France."


{C4A125}
[£o¢o]
The rules are simple.


{C4A126}
[£o¢o]
"All you have to do is to imitate a chick and 
walk around."


{C4A127}
[£o¢o]
"The winner is the one that mimics a chick or 
becomes most like a chick."


{C4A128}
[£o¢o]
The person who acts most like a chick wins.


57 :

{C4A129}
[£o¢o]
"And that's what playing 'chicks' is all 
about!"


58 :
A few minutes later...


59 :

{C4A130}
[£o¢o]
Pi-yo-pi-yo, pi-yo-pi-yo~

[Takeshi]
Pi-yo-pi-yo, pi-yo-pi-yo~


{C4A131}
[£o¢o]
Pi-yo-pi-yo-pi-yo~

[Takeshi]
Pi-yo-pi-yo-pi-yo~


{C4A132}
[£o¢o]
Pi-yo-yo, pi-yo-yo-yo, pi-yo-pi, pi-yo~

[Takeshi]
Pi-yo-yo, pi-yo-yo-yo, pi-yo-pi, pi-yo~


{C4A133}
[£o¢o]
Piiiii!

[Takeshi]
Piiiii!

Dear Father and Mother... how is everything
with you?

I'm currently playing 'chicks' 34 meters under
the surface of the ocean.

Playing 'chicks' is an elegant game developed
by Louis XIV. You win if you can mimic a
chick the best.

You flap your arms like wings and peck at
garbage that has fallen in the corridors...

Sometimes, you even trip and fall like a cute
newborn baby chick to compete to see who
looks the most like a chick.

The sounds used basically consist of three
sounds ('pi', 'yo', and 'n'), but as you get
better...


{C4A134}
[£o¢o]
Flap flap... flap flap...


{C4A135}
[£o¢o]
Furu-furu-furu... Poso...

...You can use imaginative sounds and even
express yourself with various little
chickadee gestures.

Since I'm only a beginner, I can only use
'pi', 'yo', and 'n' so far.

But I'm working hard to become a full-fledged
chick... No, I mean a full-fledged chicken like
Mom and Dad.


{C4A136}
[£o¢o]
Pi-yo-yoooooon, pi-yo-piii~

I am learning from an excellent teacher.

Oh, I don't know why, but... I'm shedding tears.


{C4A137}
[£o¢o]
Piyooo, piyo-piyo-piyoo! Pi-yo-pi-yo pi-yo?

My teacher is encouraging me.

I'm alright, I'm fine.


{C4A138}
[£o¢o]
Piyon, piyon, piyon, piyon...

My teacher wags her hips left and right as
she walks.

Sometimes, she even flips her hips up in the
air.

She is the epitome of chick-ness...


Father! Mother! My teacher is the best
'chick-mimic' in Japan... No, in the world!

[Takeshi]
Oh, but teacher...

[Takeshi]
"You don't have to take a dump in the middle 
of the floor..."


{C4A139}
[£o¢o]
Piyooo! Piyooo!

Teacher is angry with me.

It's because I spoke the human language.

[Takeshi]
Piyoyoyoyon...

That meant 'I'm sorry' in chick language.

[Takeshi]
Piyoyoyoyon... Piyoyoyoyon...

It must be very hard for you two to imagine
your own son playing 'chicks' 34 meters under
the ocean.

Or I suppose you probably don't even believe
that I'm doing this in the first place.

But I suppose I can't blame you.

I would have never dreamed I would be in this
situation up until three days ago.

How interesting life is!

How sad we humans are!

Oh, there I go crying again.

Before the ink on the paper starts to run, I
will put down the pen.

Well, dear Father and Mother, please take
care of yourself... Piyo piyo.

[Takeshi]
Piyopiyo...


{C4A140}
[£o¢o]
Piyopiyo...


60 :
That was the end of our game of 'chicks.'

Needless to say, £o¢o won the game.


£o¢o shouted with happiness and flashed a
triumphant smile.


{C4A141}
[£o¢o]
I won~ I won~

Anyway, it was over...

I exhaled a long sigh of relief.


61 :
[Takeshi]
Are you happy now?

[Takeshi]
Let's get some sleep now.


62 :

{C4A142}
[£o¢o]
Okay.


63 :
£o¢o and I started to walk.

£o¢o held my hand.

Her hand was so very small...

(Daddy, huh...?)

I thought to myself.

£o¢o had wanted so badly to call me 'daddy'...


But it seemed that she had forgotten all
about it.

I was relieved.

But at the same time, I felt a bit lonely.

(Daddy, huh...)

I repeated the word to myself again.

I had mixed feelings.


64 :
£o¢o and I went to the infirmary hand in hand.

It was £o¢o's turn to use the bed in the
infirmary that night.


65 :
We were in front of the door.

For some reason, Y¤u was standing there.


66 :

{C4A143}
[Y¤u]
Heh heh heh heh heh...


{C4A144}
[Y¤u]
I saw you guys!

Y¤u had a grin on her face.


67 :

{C4A145}
[Y¤u]
Piyo piyo, huh? What was that all about?


68 :

{C4A146}
[Y¤u]
"Ohhh, I'm embarrassed just thiiinking about 
it!"

Of course, the one who was embarrassed was me.

Burning hot blood surged up from the pit of my
stomach to my head.

All of a sudden, my face felt like it was
engulfed in flames.

[Takeshi]
"I-I don't know what the heck you're talking 
about!"

[Takeshi]
Right, £o¢o?


69 :

{C4A147}
[£o¢o]
I know what she's talking about.

[Takeshi]
Gah!


70 :

{C4A148}
[£o¢o]
"You're talking about how we were playing 
'chicks', right, Nakkyu?"


{C4A149}
[Y¤u]
Heh heh heh heh heh...


71 :

{C4A150}
[£o¢o]
"If you were watching, you should've joined 
us!"


72 :

{C4A151}
[Y¤u]
Huh...? Nah, I'm glad I passed, thanks.


{C4A152}
[£o¢o]
Why?


73 :

{C4A153}
[Y¤u]
I don't know, it's just...


74 :

{C4A154}
[£o¢o]
"Oh, I know! We can play another game right 
now!"


75 :

{C4A155}
[Y¤u]
N-now!?


{C4A156}
[Y¤u]
No, no, no, it's alright, really...


{C4A157}
[Y¤u]
Besides, it's really late, you know?


76 :

{C4A158}
[£o¢o]
Well... I suppose you're right.


77 :

{C4A159}
[Y¤u]
Whew.

Y¤u wiped away the sweat that had appeared on
her forehead with the back of her hand.


{C4A160}
[£o¢o]
Oh well.


78 :

{C4A161}
[£o¢o]
I suppose I'll wait until tomorrow then.


79 :

{C4A162}
[Y¤u]
To-tomorrow!?


80 :

{C4A163}
[£o¢o]
"Yahoo! I get to play 'chicks' with Nakkyu 
tomorrow~"


81 :
£o¢o ran off to the infirmary, gesturing like a
chick.


82 :
Y¤u and I were left standing there...

We stared at each other.

[Takeshi]
Well, you see, she had fun, okay?


83 :

{C4A164}
[Y¤u]
Are you serious?

[Takeshi]
I'm serious.


84 :

{C4A165}
[Y¤u]
I'm not really into that kind of stuff.

[Takeshi]
Me neither!

Y¤u was frowning.

But her face started to soften as I watched.


85 :

{C4A166}
[Y¤u]
Pff-fff.

Y¤u was trying hard not to laugh by pressing
her hand on her mouth...

She was probably recalling my antics from
earlier.

I had a bad feeling.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Y¤u? I've got a favor to ask...


86 :

{C4A167}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Can you just forget what you saw tonight?


87 :

{C4A168}
[Y¤u]
"Hahaha! How do you expect me to forget 
that?"

[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose...

[Takeshi]
"Then you don't have to forget it, but would 
you at least keep it a secret from Tsugumi, 
Sora, and the Kid?"


88 :

{C4A169}
[Y¤u]
Weeeell...


89 :

{C4A170}
[Y¤u]
"I guess I could keep quiet about it... at 
least for a while."

[Takeshi]
For a while?


{C4A171}
[Y¤u]
You never know when it might come in handy.

I understood.

She wanted to use it to blackmail me.


{C4A172}
[Y¤u]
So anyway, Kuranari-kun...


{C4A173}
[Y¤u]
You get my drift? Right?


90 :
Y¤u patted me on the shoulder and walked away.

I had no idea what she would ask of me, but I
knew she had me where she wanted me.


Out of the other five, she was the biggest pain.

[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...

I shook my head with a sigh and opened the
infirmary door.


91 :
It was dark inside the room, and I could
barely see anything.

Still, I heard the breathing of three sleeping
people.

Although I couldn't see any of them, I could
tell who was sleeping where.

The injured Tsugumi was sleeping on the
bed at the end of the room.

The Kid was sleeping on the examination table.

£o¢o was using the bed in the middle.

Which meant I would be sleeping...

In the decompression chamber under the
infirmary.

About 90 minutes earlier, I had actually been
sleeping there before £o¢o shoved hydrogen
peroxide up my nose...

Y¤u, it seemed, had lined up some chairs in
the conference room and gone to sleep on them.

[Takeshi]
Okay then...

I headed toward the lift in the back of the
room.

I stopped briefly to check in on £o¢o.

I went up to the bed in the middle of the room.

Although she had been so excited a little
while earlier, £o¢o seemed to be in a deep
sleep already.

(I suppose she's exhausted from all that
playing.)


{C4A174}
[£o¢o]
Uh, mmm...

£o¢o rolled over and scratched her cheek with
her fingers.

Her blanket had slightly fallen off of her.

Fixing her covers, I touched her hair gently.


{C4A175}
[£o¢o]
Mm...

£o¢o mumbled softly in her sleep.


{C4A176}
[£o¢o]
Daddy...

I didn't know which dad she was referring to...

But I couldn't help smiling.


{C4A177}
[£o¢o]
Daddy...


{C4A178}
[£o¢o]
Daddy...


{C4A179}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan...

(What...?)


92 :

{C4A180}
[£o¢o]
I'm so cold...


{C4A181}
[£o¢o]
Please... let me out of here...


93 :

{C4A182}
[£o¢o]
Help me...


{C4A183}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan...


94 :

{C4A182}
[£o¢o]
Help me...


{C4A183}
[£o¢o]
Onii-chan...


95 :

{C4A184}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
Huh?


{C4A185}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
What is it, Sara?

It had been over twelve hours since Sara started
calling me 'onii-chan'.

The swelling of Sara's eyelids had just
started to fade.

But her eyes still watered.

About twelve hours before, Sora had told us the truth.


96 :
Even since seeing the hologram in the Cosmic
Whale room, I had kind of sensed it.

Sara was my sister...

Maybe I had already known it when I saved
Sara from the elevator.


Maybe I had just pretended not to realize,
when, in fact, I really had...

{16:4}

97 :
It was strange, but I didn't quite understand
the details of my own mental state.

Because it almost felt like the person who had
caused me to pretend was a 'me' that wasn't
really 'me'.

If that made sense...

I knew I had to find out the truth from the
moment I'd seen the pendant in the Cosmic Whale
room, especially after I noticed it had a
missing piece.

{16:4}

98 :
I could tell Sara felt the same way.

I didn't know from exactly what point she
started wondering if I was her brother...

Looking back on it, there were many times she
might have hinted at it.

But all those moments had seemed to me like
she was half-joking.

{16:4}

99 :
The moment that everything came together was
when I saw the image in the hologram.

Because I had been able to see something that
nobody else could...

But still, both Sara and I weren't certain
when we had been in the Cosmic Whale room.

We needed definite proof.

{16:4}

100 :
That was why we went to visit Sora, even
though it was late at night.

To have her surgically remove the fragment
from my thumb...

Since Sora wasn't able to perform the actual
operation, we decided to wake up Y¤u.

At first, Y¤u had no idea what we were talking
about, but as soon as she understood the
situation, she willingly agreed to help.

{16:4}

101 :
As we expected, the piece removed from my
thumb had matched the missing part in the
pendant exactly.

What was more, when we exposed the piece to
infrared light, an image of the same man in
the pendant came up.

According to Sora, unlike a regular picture, a
hologram 'shows the whole image in a part'.

{16:4}

102 :
For a picture, it would be impossible to see
the whole image with just one piece of
it...

But with a hologram, it was possible to
generate the whole image even from a tiny
piece.

That was one of the special properties of a
hologram.

{16:4}

103 :
To explain a little bit about 'infrared vision
(infravision)'...

Usually, the visible range for humans was
limited to light with a wavelength of between
380 to 780 nanometers.

Light with a wavelength longer than that was
called infrared.

Normal humans couldn't see light in that range.

If you were able to see infrared, you would
be able to sense the temperature of an object
without actually touching it.

{16:4}

104 :
And with that ability, you could also see in
complete darkness, even without any light.

Infrared rays were emitted from all objects
that had temperature. Stronger light was
emitted from warmer objects, and weaker light
from colder objects.

By sensing those things, you could tell the
location and shape of an object in the
darkness.

{16:4}

105 :
Surprisingly, Sara and I were told that we
had the ability called 'infrared vision'.

Since we had that ability naturally, it was
difficult for us to imagine not being able to
sense the temperature or to imagine complete
darkness.

But I realized something then.


106 :
That was why I had been able to notice the
generator room door was hot.

{16:4}

107 :
That was why I had noticed heat emanating
from the generator room door, and that was
why I had mistaken the light from the
inverter unit for moonlight.

{16:4}

108 :
That was why Sara and I were able to see the
3D image in the pendant that nobody else
could see.

Why did we have that ability? I had no idea.

{16:4}


109 :
Sora explained to us that it was a special
ability passed on genetically.

Genetics. That also meant it was highly
possible that Sara and I had the same parents.

That was when it became almost certain that
Sara and I were brother and sister, but
still... something seemed to be missing.

{16:4}

110 :
We took a DNA test with the repaired L-MRI.


The result showed that Sara and I were blood
relatives with a 99.99999% certainty.

{16:4}

111 :
That had proven everything.

And when that happened, memories of my
childhood started to flood back.

They rocked me like an explosion.

All of the memories that had been dammed
up flooded out at once, their bombardment
rendering me unconscious again.

{16:4}

112 :
When I regained consciousness, Sara was next
to me.

Sara... My one and only sister...

We were fraternal twins...

I recalled the bittersweet memories of the
days we had spent together.

{16:4}

113 :

{C4A186}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
Yeah?


{C4A187}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
Yes, Sara?

We hadn't slept at all since the day before.

We had spent a long half-day talking about
all sorts of things.

The memories of our childhood...

Then our time at the 'hospital' as well, of
course.

How I hadn't kept my promise... Couldn't keep
my promise...

I had sworn to her that I would come to get
her...

Sara and I took a long time going over and
understanding all of the details.

There was too much to talk about.

A half-day was hardly enough to restore the
missing time.

But...

Sara and I didn't need many words anymore.

'Onii-chan.' 'Yes, Sara?'‡LWith just those
words, we could understand each other.


114 :
Sara put her head on my shoulder and closed
her eyes gently.

I sang her favorite lullaby.


115 :
[Kid]
Moon sprite... shouldering a long bow...

[Kid]
Waiting... inside a dream...

[Kid]
Tonight... a story by moonlight...

[Kid]
Hoping the wait... will be short...

[Kid]
Sleeping... curled and snug...

[Kid]
Sleeping... in mother's arms...


116 :

{C4A188}
[£o¢o]
Moon sprite... shouldering a long bow...


{C4A189}
[£o¢o]
Waiting... inside a dream...


{C4A190}
[£o¢o]
Tonight... a story by moonlight...


{C4A191}
[£o¢o]
Hoping the wait... will be short...


{C4A192}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping... curled and snug...


{C4A193}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping... in mother's arms...


117 :
Clap clap clap...


118 :

{C4A194}
[Y¤u]
You've got a great voice, £o¢o.


{C4A195}
[£o¢o]
Don't I? Don't I?


{C4A196}
[Y¤u]
"I've never heard that song before... Is it a 
lullaby or something?"


119 :

{C4A197}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, it's a lullaby.


{C4A198}
[£o¢o]
My mom used to sing it to me.


{C4A199}
[Y¤u]
"So I guess that song has a lot of good 
memories for you."


{C4A200}
[£o¢o]
No.


120 :

{C4A201}
[Y¤u]
No? It doesn't?


{C4A202}
[£o¢o]
No, I just learned this song.


{C4A203}
[Y¤u]
Oh, really...?

Their voices were coming from the kiosk.

I went in.


121 :
[Takeshi]
Hey!


{C4A204}
[£o¢o]
Oh, Takepyon~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!


{C4A205}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari... What are you doing here?

[Takeshi]
"Oh, I just thought I'd see what you looked 
like playing 'chicks'."

Yep, that was the reason I had gone searching
for them and eventually wound up at the
souvenir shop.


{C4A206}
[£o¢o]
Oh, we finished playing that a while ago.

[Takeshi]
What!? Really!?


{C4A207}
[£o¢o]
Nakkyu was sooooo good at it...


{C4A208}
[£o¢o]
"Compared to me, she was sooooo much more 
like a real chick..."


{C4A209}
[£o¢o]
I was just amazed!


{C4A210}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, stop it, you're just trying to embarrass 
me with compliments!"


{C4A211}
[£o¢o]
It's true!


{C4A212}
[£o¢o]
You were really, really good!


{C4A213}
[Y¤u]
Ehehehehehehe...

Y¤u, who had seemed so against the game to
begin with, was embarrassed once she was
complimented.

What on earth was going on?

Had she actually enjoyed the game?


Speaking from the standpoint of someone who
had experienced it...

The game 'chicks' did seem to possess a kind of
ritualistic, demonic charm that could subdue
the human ability to be rational...

It seemed to me that Y¤u might have been
possessed by that charm.

Oh well, that wasn't important.

What was important was that I had somehow
missed out on the historical moment that was
Y¤u's performance.

It was truly unfortunate...

(Darn it.)

I mentally clicked my tongue.

[Takeshi]
So? What are you doing now?


{C4A214}
[Y¤u]
Isn't it obvious?

£o¢o and Y¤u were sitting face-to-face on the
carpet.

Pipi had set his face on £o¢o's head.

Between the two of them was a mountain of
small, bead-like grains.

A pen was stuck atop the mountain.


[Takeshi]
A game of avalanche with a mountain of sand?


{C4A215}
[Y¤u]
That's right!


{C4A216}
[£o¢o]
No, Nakkyu, that's not right.


{C4A217}
[Y¤u]
What?


{C4A218}
[£o¢o]
This is a mountain of tears...


{C4A219}
[£o¢o]
It's a mountain of tears, not sand.

A mountain of tears?

I sat next to them and pinched a single grain
from the mountain.

[Takeshi]
Oh, I remember...

[Takeshi]
"£o¢o was throwing these into the puddle at 
the ruins yesterday."

Clear, colorless grains. They were formed in
the shape of a drop of water.

Glass tears‡L

No, they weren't made of glass.

I could tell by touching them.

[Takeshi]
"You never told me what they were yesterday, 
did you?"

[Takeshi]
So I guess I'll try again... What are they?


{C4A220}
[Y¤u]
They're mermaid tears.

[Takeshi]
Mermaid tears?

£o¢o closed her eyes and nodded.

[Takeshi]
"I don't care what you say, there's no way 
these are real mermaid teardrops."


{C4A221}
[Y¤u]
Oh yeah?

Saying that, Y¤u pointed to the display racks
of the souvenir shop.

[Takeshi]
?

I stood up and walked toward where Y¤u had
pointed.


122 :
The racks were packed with different kinds of
merchandise.

Among all the stuff, there was a corner with
a line of old-looking ceramic bottles.


123 :
I picked up one of the bottles and looked at
it.

It was slightly bigger than the size of my
palm and heavier than I had imagined. It felt
solid in my hand.

Printed on the label was 'Mermaid Tears'.


I looked at the bottom of the bottle. There
was a round stamp on it.

'Contents: Candy'

'Ingredients: sugar, corn syrup, acidifier,
flavoring'

I shook the bottle. I heard a dry, crisp sound.

Pulling out the cork top, I poured some out
on my palm.

I poured too much, and some of them spilled
from my hand to the floor.

The 'mermaid tears' bounced on the carpet as
if they were dancing.


124 :
[Takeshi]
I see.

Holding the bottle in my right hand and the
'teardrops' in my left, I went back to where
I had been sitting before and plopped myself
down with a thud.

[Takeshi]
"So these 'mermaid tears' are just some kind 
of souvenir?"


{C4A222}
[£o¢o]
Yup.

[Takeshi]
Let's see...

Mumbling to myself, I popped all the
'teardrops' from my left hand into my mouth.

I chomped down on them hard.

The melting sweetness spread in my mouth.


[Takeshi]
These are good!

It had been a long time since I had tasted
anything besides a tuna sandwich.

I had heard somewhere before that eating
sweets made people feel happy.

And at that moment, I was enraptured by the
sweetness in my mouth.


{C4A223}
[£o¢o]
Ohhhh my gosh~


{C4A224}
[£o¢o]
You shouldn't have done that~


{C4A225}
[£o¢o]
I'm gonna tell on you~

[Takeshi]
Why? Is it because I'm eating them for free?

[Takeshi]
Well, you are too, £o¢o.


{C4A226}
[£o¢o]
No, no.


{C4A227}
[£o¢o]
That wasn't what I meant at all.


{C4A228}
[£o¢o]
"You just ate the teardrops of a mermaid, 
didn't you, Takepyon?"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, I did.

[Takeshi]
And I'm going to eat more.


{C4A229}
[£o¢o]
If you do that...


{C4A230}
[£o¢o]
You'll end up like 'the 800-year-old nun'.

[Takeshi]
Who...?


{C4A231}
[Y¤u]
800-year-old what?

Y¤u and I looked at each other.


{C4A232}
[£o¢o]
"You don't know the story of Yaobikuni, the 
800-year-old nun?"

[Takeshi]
Do you know what she's talking about, Y¤u?


{C4A233}
[Y¤u]
Nope. Not a clue.


{C4A234}
[£o¢o]
"Alright then. I, £o¢o-chan, will tell you the 
story of the 800-year-old nun!"

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A235}
[£o¢o]
Hey, don't forget the applause.

Clap clap clap clap...


125 :

{C4A236}
[£o¢o]
Okay. It starts like this...


126 :

{C4A237}
[£o¢o]
"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young 
girl."


{C4A238}
[£o¢o]
"She was seventeen years old, and she loved 
camellia flowers."


{C4A239}
[£o¢o]
She also had a very handsome boyfriend.


{C4A240}
[£o¢o]
"And he was about her same age. I think he 
was at least."


{C4A241}
[£o¢o]
"Anyway, one day, he gave her a camellia 
flower as a gift and said..."


{C4A242}
[£o¢o]
'This flower is for you.'


{C4A243}
[£o¢o]
'Oh my, what a beautiful flower this is.'


{C4A244}
[£o¢o]
"'Yeah, this flower sure is pretty... but 
you're even more beautiful. Even a million of 
these flowers wouldn't be as pretty as you.'"


{C4A245}
[£o¢o]
'Oh, you're such a sweet talker, you.'


{C4A246}
[£o¢o]
"'Hey, I'm not just trying to flatter you, I'm 
telling the truth.'"


{C4A247}
[£o¢o]
'Oh, sweetheart...'


{C4A248}
[£o¢o]
'My love...'


{C4A249}
[£o¢o]
"They were so passionately in love that they 
could talk this way in public without being 
embarrassed about it."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A250}
[£o¢o]
Well, one day...


{C4A251}
[£o¢o]
"The girl's dad, his name was Gonta-kun, went 
diving into the ocean."


{C4A252}
[£o¢o]
"He did that because this old guy who lived 
in the ocean was like..."


{C4A253}
[£o¢o]
"'Hey, Gonta-kun, I'm having a home party, wanna 
come?', and invited him to a party."


{C4A254}
[£o¢o]
"Gonta-kun arrived at the most gorgeous 
mansion he'd ever seen in his whole life."


{C4A255}
[£o¢o]
"But strangely, he was able to breathe once he
got inside."


{C4A256}
[£o¢o]
"'Oh, good to see you, Gonta-kun.'‡Lthe old guy 
welcomed him."


{C4A257}
[£o¢o]
"Gonta-kun had a gourmet dinner and a wonderful 
time."


{C4A258}
[£o¢o]
"But it eventually it came time for him to go 
home."


{C4A259}
[£o¢o]
"Gonta-kun said, 'I'm real sorry, but I've got to 
go home soon.'"


{C4A260}
[£o¢o]
"The old man who lived under the ocean said, 
'Huh, you're leaving so soon? That's too bad.'"


{C4A261}
[£o¢o]
"'My daughter's waiting for me at home. I'll 
come again sometime soon, okay?'"


{C4A262}
[£o¢o]
"'Oh well... Hey, why don't you take this for 
souvenir?'"


{C4A263}
[£o¢o]
"The old man handed him a bottle of something 
that looked like alcohol."


{C4A264}
[£o¢o]
'What's this?' asked Gonta-kun.


{C4A265}
[£o¢o]
The old man answered with a big smile.


{C4A266}
[£o¢o]
'It's mermaid tears.'

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A267}
[£o¢o]
"Gonta-kun went home and hid the souvenir in the 
cabinet."


{C4A268}
[£o¢o]
"And... a few days later... an incident took 
place."


{C4A269}
[£o¢o]
"While Gonta-kun wasn't home, his daughter 
secretly opened the cabinet and drank all the 
liquid in the bottle."


{C4A270}
[£o¢o]
"It was so delicious that the girl drank the 
whole thing up."


{C4A271}
[£o¢o]
And...


{C4A272}
[£o¢o]
After that, the girl stopped aging at all.


{C4A273}
[£o¢o]
"A year had passed, then two, and then 
three..."


{C4A274}
[£o¢o]
"After 5, 10 and 20 years, the girl was 
still as beautiful as always."


{C4A275}
[£o¢o]
She had a body that would never age.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A276}
[£o¢o]
"Eternal youth and longevity has always been a 
dream and a hope for humans, but it wasn't 
the case for this girl."


{C4A277}
[£o¢o]
She lamented and cursed her own fate.


{C4A278}
[£o¢o]
"Because she stayed at the age of seventeen, but 
her boyfriend grew older and older."


{C4A279}
[£o¢o]
"One day, an incident happened that was very 
sad."


{C4A280}
[£o¢o]
"Her boyfriend passed from this world to the 
next at the tender age of 34."


{C4A281}
[£o¢o]
Before he died, he said to her...


{C4A282}
[£o¢o]
"'Wait for me for 700 years! After 700 years 
have passed, I'll be reborn into this world 
and come to you!'"


{C4A283}
[£o¢o]
"The girl cried and cried. BOY did she just 
cry and cry."


{C4A284}
[£o¢o]
"After a while, because she was so sad at 
losing him, she decided to leave on a long 
trip."


{C4A285}
[£o¢o]
"She renounced the material world and decided 
to live her life as a nun."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A286}
[£o¢o]
"The nun traveled around the country. She 
cured the sick, helped the poor, did a little 
farming, built some bridges over rivers, and 
planted lots of camellia seeds."


{C4A287}
[£o¢o]
"When the camellias grew mature, healthy, and 
started to flower, she would move on to 
another region and begin all over again 
helping those in need..."


{C4A288}
[£o¢o]
"She continued living that way for hundreds of 
years."


{C4A289}
[£o¢o]
"The reason she planted camellia seeds was as 
a way of giving directions to her boyfriend 
in case he came looking for her."


{C4A290}
[£o¢o]
"She planted lots and lots of camellia seeds 
so that when he was reborn into this world, 
he would know where she was."


{C4A291}
[£o¢o]
She hadn't given up hope.


{C4A292}
[£o¢o]
"She had kept believing the whole time that 
her boyfriend's words would come true."


{C4A293}
[£o¢o]
"At last, 700 hundred years passed, and she 
returned to her homeland."


{C4A294}
[£o¢o]
But there wasn't anyone who knew her anymore.


{C4A295}
[£o¢o]
"With no place to live, she decided to enter 
a cave on the outskirts of the village."


{C4A296}
[£o¢o]
"She planted many, many camellia seeds near 
the entrance."


{C4A297}
[£o¢o]
"Before she entered the cave, she told 
the villagers..."


{C4A298}
[£o¢o]
'I will ring a bell at sunrise and sunset.'


{C4A299}
[£o¢o]
"'If you stop hearing the bell, please just 
think that I have passed away.'"

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


{C4A300}
[£o¢o]
A year passed, then two, and three...


{C4A301}
[£o¢o]
"After 5, 10, then 20 years, her 
boyfriend STILL didn't show up."


{C4A302}
[£o¢o]
"30 years passed, then 40, and then 50 years 
passed..."


{C4A303}
[£o¢o]
"After 60, 70, 80 years had passed, her 
boyfriend STILL hadn't shown up."


{C4A304}
[£o¢o]
800 years had passed since she was born.


{C4A305}
[£o¢o]
The bell finally stopped ringing.


{C4A306}
[£o¢o]
"After all that time, her boyfriend had never 
appeared."


{C4A307}
[£o¢o]
"The camellias in front of the cave blossomed 
beautifully, never wilting for many years."


{C4A308}
[£o¢o]
"People honored this young and beautiful nun 
and prayed for her..."


{C4A309}
[£o¢o]
And wished for longevity and happiness...


{C4A310}
[£o¢o]
"And people decided to call her 'Yaobikuni', 
the 800-year-old nun."


{C4A311}
[£o¢o]
The end.


127 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


128 :

{C4A312}
[£o¢o]
Oh, not really... It's 'to be continued'...


{C4A313}
[Y¤u]
...Huh?

[Takeshi]
There's more!?


{C4A314}
[£o¢o]
"Well, actually, that's the end for the tale I 
know."


{C4A315}
[£o¢o]
But there might be more to the tale...


{C4A316}
[Y¤u]
What do you mean?


{C4A317}
[£o¢o]
Well, nobody actually found her body.


{C4A318}
[£o¢o]
"They just figured she was dead because the 
bell stopped ringing..."

[Takeshi]
Hmmm...


{C4A319}
[£o¢o]
"Maybe, maybe she's still alive in a cave 
somewhere in Japan, you know?"


{C4A320}
[Y¤u]
Still waiting for her 'boyfriend'?

[Takeshi]
Stupid! There's no way that story is true!

[Takeshi]
It's just an old fairy tale, that's all.


{C4A321}
[£o¢o]
I don't know...


{C4A322}
[£o¢o]
"I think she might still be alive 
somewhere..."


{C4A323}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, me too!

[Takeshi]
Oh, come on, are you guys serious?


{C4A324}
[Y¤u]
Hey, £o¢o? When was this nun born anyway?


{C4A325}
[£o¢o]
"I don't know exactly, but I've heard it was 
about 1300 years ago."

[Takeshi]
"Haha! You see? 1300 years ago. If she were 
still alive, she'd be 1300 years old!"


{C4A326}
[Y¤u]
"Look, you don't have to inform us of the 
obvious."

[Takeshi]
Let me put it this way.

[Takeshi]
"1300 years from now would be like 700 A.D.‡LThat 
means she would have been living since 
the Nara era, or even before that."

[Takeshi]
That would amaze even Prince Nakano-Ooe.


{C4A327}
[Y¤u]
What are you so worked up about...?


{C4A328}
[Y¤u]
"You're the one who said it was just an 'old 
story', Kuranari."

[Takeshi]
I'm not worked up...


{C4A329}
[Y¤u]
"You're old enough to know what I'm talking 
about."


{C4A330}
[Y¤u]
"Don't break girls' romantic dreams for no 
good reason."


{C4A331}
[Y¤u]
Right, £o¢o?


{C4A332}
[£o¢o]
Yeah.

[Takeshi]
.........


{C4A333}
[Y¤u]
"She entered the cave at the age of 700, so 
that means she waited for her boyfriend 
another 600 years, right?"


{C4A334}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, but she might still be alive, so that 
makes it 'she is waiting', as in the present 
tense."


{C4A335}
[Y¤u]
Anyway...


{C4A336}
[Y¤u]
"When her boyfriend finally arrives at the 
entrance of the cave, which is overflowing 
with camellia flowers...!"


{C4A337}
[Y¤u]
They will finally be reunited~


{C4A338}
[Y¤u]
"And the extra 600 years of loneliness will be 
rewarded~"


{C4A339}
[Y¤u]
Their 1300-year-old love will be fulfilled~


{C4A340}
[Y¤u]
Oh, how romantic~


{C4A341}
[£o¢o]
Romantic, huh...


129 :

{C4A342}
[£o¢o]
I think it's more sad than romantic...

[Takeshi]
?


{C4A343}
[Y¤u]
?


{C4A344}
[£o¢o]
Well, I mean...


{C4A345}
[£o¢o]
She's been waiting in this deep dark cave...


{C4A346}
[£o¢o]
"Just waiting for her boyfriend for the 
longest time, you know?"


{C4A347}
[£o¢o]
She's been all alone.


{C4A348}
[£o¢o]
So alone and so lonely...


{C4A349}
[£o¢o]
But she couldn't die either...


{C4A350}
[£o¢o]
"I wish she'd never drank those mermaid's 
tears..."

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o?


130 :

{C4A351}
[£o¢o]
What?

[Takeshi]
Do you believe that mermaids actually exist?


{C4A352}
[Y¤u]
"Geez... There you go again... You're too 
practical."

[Takeshi]
"Well, if mermaids don't exist, then you can 
forget about the whole story to begin with."


{C4A353}
[Y¤u]
That's not necessarily true~


{C4A354}
[Y¤u]
"Whether mermaids exist or not doesn't have 
anything to do with whether or not this 
story is true."

[Takeshi]
Why not?


{C4A355}
[Y¤u]
"Well, it's obvious that the liquid Gonta-kun got 
from that old man was a 'longevity potion', I 
don't care what you say."


{C4A356}
[Y¤u]
"They could have just named it 'mermaid tears', 
right?"


{C4A357}
[Y¤u]
"What I'm trying to say is that the potion didn't 
actually have to be made from mermaid 
teardrops."


{C4A358}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, these candies aren't actual mermaid 
teardrops."

[Takeshi]
Well, you have a point.

[Takeshi]
"So 'mermaid tears' is only the name for that 
strange liquid, right?"

[Takeshi]
"Alright, fine. Let's skip the whole mermaid 
business."

[Takeshi]
But, you know, Y¤u?

[Takeshi]
Think really hard, will you?

[Takeshi]
"Do you honestly think that something like 
eternal youth exists?"


{C4A359}
[Y¤u]
I do.

[Takeshi]
You have a basis for that belief?


{C4A360}
[Y¤u]
Yes.

[Takeshi]
Okay, show me then.


{C4A361}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll show you!

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A362}
[Y¤u]
"This is a little off topic, but... doesn't 
this story of Yaobikuni remind you of 
something else?"

[Takeshi]
?


{C4A363}
[£o¢o]
?


{C4A364}
[Y¤u]
I'm talking about the tale of Rip Van Winkle.

[Takeshi]
Rip Van...


{C4A365}
[£o¢o]
...Winkle?


{C4A366}
[Y¤u]
"Well, the father got invited to a party and 
got some kind of alcoholic beverage, right?"


{C4A367}
[Y¤u]
That's just like Rip Van Winkle.

[Takeshi]
So what?


{C4A368}
[Y¤u]
What I'm trying to say is this...


{C4A369}
[Y¤u]
"Rip Van Winkle drank the liquor and became a 
very old man, right?"


{C4A370}
[Y¤u]
"Yaobikuni drank the 'mermaid tears' and 
gained a body of perpetual youth that never 
ages..."


{C4A371}
[Y¤u]
And that means that...

[Takeshi]
"Ohhh... I'm beginning to see what you're 
trying to say."

[Takeshi]
"Rip Van Winkle hits the bottle just a little 
tooooo hard, and when he wakes up, 20 years have 
passed."

[Takeshi]
Just like with the 800-year-old nun...

[Takeshi]
"By drinking 'mermaid tears', she was sent 700 
or 800 years into the future."

[Takeshi]
"So she didn't actually gain eternal youth, 
she just slipped through time into the future."

[Takeshi]
"So THAT explains why she stayed 17 years old even 
after 800 years."

[Takeshi]
You think that explains it?

[Takeshi]
Well, it doesn't!

[Takeshi]
"There's no such thing as time travel in real 
life!"


{C4A372}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, hey, wait a second... Don't go jumping to 
conclusions."


{C4A373}
[Y¤u]
I never said a word about time travel, did I?

[Takeshi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A374}
[Y¤u]
"I'm just curious about the similarity between 
the 'dwarven spirits' and 'mermaid tears.'"


{C4A375}
[Y¤u]
"The dwarven liquor was actually... a solution 
that rapidly accelerates aging."


{C4A376}
[Y¤u]
"What was in the tears was... a solution that 
slows down aging."


{C4A377}
[Y¤u]
"Both of them were handed down from some old 
guy."


{C4A378}
[Y¤u]
"And both of them were given at a mysterious 
gathering."


{C4A379}
[Y¤u]
So it tells us...


{C4A380}
[Y¤u]
"Both 'dwarven spirits' and 'mermaid 
tears'..."


{C4A381}
[Y¤u]
"...Are possibly made by the same people or 
by the same civilization."

[Takeshi]
It tells us that?


{C4A382}
[Y¤u]
IT DOES!

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A383}
[Y¤u]
"Well, the castle in £o¢o's story might have 
been part of some ruins of an ancient 
civilization, sunken under the ocean."


{C4A384}
[Y¤u]
For example, the civilization of Lemuria.


{C4A385}
[Y¤u]
"In Lemuria, it's thought they had science 
and technology that could control aging..."


{C4A386}
[Y¤u]
"And for some reason, Gonta-kun got invited to the 
castle."


{C4A387}
[Y¤u]
Uh-huh.

[Takeshi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A388}
[Y¤u]
So? Are you satisfied?

[Takeshi]
"I think that was a pretty random 
explanation... but that's okay, I guess."

[Takeshi]
I got your point.

[Takeshi]
"But you still haven't given me any 
substantial evidence that eternal youth 
exists."

[Takeshi]
"The point of what you just said was 
basically this..."

[Takeshi]
"'Rip Van Winkle and the 800-year-old nun's dad 
must have made contact with the lost 
civilization of Lemuria.'"

[Takeshi]
"Alright then, let's just SUPPOSE this 
assumption was correct."

[Takeshi]
"Even if the civilization of Lemuria actually 
did exist..."

[Takeshi]
"Nobody knows if they had the technology to 
control aging, right?"

[Takeshi]
There's no way you can prove it.

[Takeshi]
"Besides, Lemuria never did and never will 
exist."

[Takeshi]
"Sclater's theory was disproven a 
long time ago."


{C4A389}
[£o¢o]
What's Sclater?

[Takeshi]
The name of an English zoologist.

[Takeshi]
In the mid-19th century, he...

[Takeshi]
"He noticed that the same species of lemur 
inhabited Africa, Madagascar Islands, Asia, 
and the Indonesian Islands."

[Takeshi]
"But lemurs can't swim... Well, maybe just a 
little, but certainly not a long distance."

[Takeshi]
"Well then, how could the same kind of lemurs 
reside on different islands separated by a 
massive ocean?"

[Takeshi]
Sclater thought...

[Takeshi]
"'That's it! A long time ago, there must have 
been a great landmass in the Indian Ocean, 
and these islands must have been connected as 
one!'"

[Takeshi]
"But by the mid-20th century, the theory of 
continental drift had been proven, and 
Sclater's theory was ignored after that."

[Takeshi]
"'A long, long time ago, all the land on the 
earth today formed one big continent...'"

[Takeshi]
"'Which very slowly got broken up, and the 
continents shifted with the movement of the 
earth's crust, or by virtue of plate 
tectonics, to become the way they are today.'"

[Takeshi]
"To be precise, the land masses are still 
moving even today by several centimeters
every year."

[Takeshi]
"The theory of continental drift was now 
known to be fact rather than just theory."

[Takeshi]
"So the reason why lemurs exist on different 
islands can be explained by this theory."

[Takeshi]
"So there! You see? There is no such thing as 
Lemuria!"

[Takeshi]
"If there's no Lemuria, there couldn't be a 
Lemurian civilization!"


{C4A390}
[Y¤u]
Oh really?


{C4A391}
[Y¤u]
You don't say?

[Takeshi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A392}
[Y¤u]
"Well, sorry to cut you off when you're just 
getting started, but the 'Lemuria' I was 
referring to was in the Pacific Ocean."


{C4A393}
[Y¤u]
"Why would a Japanese person like Gonta-kun 
go all the way over to the Strait of Malacca, then to 
the Indian Ocean?"


{C4A394}
[Y¤u]
Lemuria was located in the Pacific Ocean.

[Takeshi]
"In the Pacific Ocean...? Are you, by any chance, 
talking about the continent of Mu?"


{C4A395}
[Y¤u]
It doesn't matter what you call it.


{C4A396}
[Y¤u]
"There used to be an ancient civilization in 
the Pacific before recorded history."


{C4A397}
[Y¤u]
"Some people call it Lemuria, others call it 
Mu. It doesn't really matter, does it?"

[Takeshi]
Oh... I'm getting a headache...

[Takeshi]
"I guess you're right, it doesn't matter... It 
really doesn't..."

[Takeshi]
"Whether you call it Lemuria or Mu, it never 
existed anyway."


{C4A398}
[Y¤u]
Why do you have to be so serious...?


{C4A399}
[Y¤u]
It's so childish...


{C4A400}
[Y¤u]
Don't you have any imagination, Kuranari?

[Takeshi]
"You're the one who's childish! You're eighteen, 
right!? Grow up, will you!? Get real!"

[Takeshi]
"An ancient civilization before time, 
perpetual youth and longevity, Rip Van 
Winkle, 800-year-old nun, and Santa 
Claus... None of these exist!"

[Takeshi]
They're all just fairy tales!


{C4A401}
[Y¤u]
Not all fairy tales are fiction!


{C4A402}
[Y¤u]
Some of them may be real!

[Takeshi]
No way!


{C4A403}
[Y¤u]
Yes way!


{C4A404}
[Y¤u]
"Well I, for one, believe Rip Van Winkle 
really existed!"

[Takeshi]
Oh, you're so sure, huh?

[Takeshi]
Do you have any proof? Do you?


{C4A405}
[Y¤u]
Of course!

[Takeshi]
Then let's see it.


{C4A406}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll show you!

[£o¢o]
.........


{C4A407}
[Y¤u]
Rip Van Winkle was...

[Takeshi]
What?


{C4A408}
[Y¤u]
Rip Van Winkle was... Rip Van Winkle was...

[Takeshi]
?


{C4A409}
[£o¢o]
?


131 :

{C4A410}
[Y¤u]
Rip... Van... W... inkle... was...


{C4A411}
[Y¤u]
...Winkle... was...

Suddenly, Y¤u put her hand on her chest and
seemed to be suffering.


132 :
[Takeshi]
What's wrong!?


{C4A412}
[£o¢o]
Hey, are you okay, Nakkyu!?


{C4A413}
[Y¤u]
Uh-huh...


{C4A414}
[Y¤u]
I'm okay...


{C4A415}
[Y¤u]
It happens... all the time...

[Takeshi]
What do you mean all the time!?

Y¤u's face had gone pale.

Her lips were almost purple, and sweat began
to run down her forehead.

She grabbed her chest with her right hand.


{C4A416}
[Y¤u]
Uhhhh...

She groaned in a low voice and squatted to the
floor.

She jabbed her left hand into the mountain of
tears.

The mermaid tears scattered everywhere, and
the pen on top flew in the air.


{C4A417}
[Y¤u]
I'll... be... alright...

She didn't seem alright at all.

Her breathing was fast, and her body was stiff
and shaking, her facial color almost seeming
like that of a corpse.

(What should we do!?)

(Should I leave Y¤u here and call for help!?)

(No! We don't have any time to lose!)


(To the infirmary! I've got to take her to the
infirmary!)

[Takeshi]
£o¢o! I'm gonna carry Y¤u to the infirmary!

[Takeshi]
"So you go ahead and tell everybody what's
