1 :
Finally, the roaring sounds stopped, and the
flow of the water slowed.

The squeaking and screeching of metal on metal
also died down.

It seemed like the flooding had stopped.


2 :
There was still a little air left in the
ceiling of the infirmary.

It was kind of like a cup flipped upside down and
mostly filled with water.

Sara and I were floating there.

[Kid]
"It looks like things have quieted down 
a bit..."

I looked at Sara.

In the darkness, the only thing giving off a
gentle aura of light was Sara.

[Kid]
Are you okay, Sara?


{S7A000}
[Sara]
Yeah. I'm okay... Just... a little cold.

Sara forced a smile for me.

[Kid]
Sara... why did you come back?

[Kid]
"All you had to do was go a little farther, and 
you would have been safe..."


{S7A001}
[Sara]
Uh... I...


{S7A002}
[Sara]
Do you promise you won't get mad?

[Kid]
Mad? Why would I get mad?


{S7A003}
[Sara]
Well...

[Kid]
Just tell me.


3 :
I thought something was strange.

From the beginning, Sara had always seemed
like she had the upper hand in our
relationship.

But once we knew that we were brother and
sister, it felt like things had been reversed.

Sara was relying on me... like when
we were kids.

{16:4}

4 :

{S7A004}
[Sara]
Well...


{S7A005}
[Sara]
This...

Sara lifted her right hand.

Pinched between her fingers was the shard
of the mirror from my finger.

[Kid]
Hey... it's that piece of the mirror.


{S7A006}
[Sara]
"Yeah. I realized when we were running that 
this had been left here."

[Kid]
So you came back for something like this!?


{S7A007}
[Sara]
It's not just anything!


{S7A008}
[Sara]
"This was something that you fought so hard to 
protect!"

[Kid]
Sara...

[Kid]
"But this isn't something worth risking your 
life to come back for!"

[Kid]
You had the pendant anyway!


{S7A009}
[Sara]
You're right... I'm sorry.


{S7A010}
[Sara]
I got you involved in all of this...

[Kid]
"I chose to turn back. You can't blame 
yourself for that."


{S7A011}
[Sara]
No, I'm sorry...

After that, Sara didn't speak for a while.

[Kid]
Sara?


5 :

{S7A012}
[Sara]
To tell the truth... it wasn't just that...

[Kid]
Huh?


{S7A013}
[Sara]
I was scared... to go outside...

[Kid]
Scared? Of what...?


{S7A014}
[Sara]
"I thought that once I got outside, everything 
would return to like it was..."


{S7A015}
[Sara]
"And once I thought about that, I couldn't move 
anymore..."

[Kid]
Like it was? What are you talking about...?


{S7A016}
[Sara]
"I thought that Leiblich would start 
controlling us again. And all my freedom 
would be taken away..."


{S7A017}
[Sara]
"When I thought that I'd never be free again, 
I was paralyzed."

[Kid]
Paralyzed...?


{S7A018}
[Sara]
"Ever since we've been trapped in 
LeMU... everyone has been trying to escape, 
but..."


6 :

{S7A019}
[Sara]
But... I was happy.


{S7A020}
[Sara]
"Nobody was looking over me, and I've been 
able to decide things for myself..."


{S7A021}
[Sara]
When I thought about that, I was so happy.


{S7A022}
[Sara]
"Ever since I entered Leiblich's research 
institute, I haven't felt free even once..."

Sara's words left me stunned.


7 :
I wondered why I had never thought of things
that way before.

Leiblich had written me off early on.

I figured that it was probably because the
only special power I had was seeing infrared
light.

{16:4}

8 :
But Sara was probably different.

The way that she had been able to use
computers... Y¤u had called her a first-rate
hacker.

It was probably only the beginning.

After I had left the institute, Sara must have
lived under constant observation and undergone
experiments.

{16:4}

9 :
Thinking about it then amazed me.


{S7A023}
[Sara]
"When all of this started, I thought this 
accident was just some kind of test of my 
abilities or something..."


{S7A024}
[Sara]
"And when I found out that Sora was 
RSD-generated, I suspected that she 
was here to observe me..."


{S7A025}
[Sara]
"But since Nakkyu was here... I realized that 
it was probably just an accident..."


{S7A026}
[Sara]
And it made me happy...


{S7A027}
[Sara]
"Until now, everywhere I've gone, there's been 
someone watching me..."


{S7A028}
[Sara]
"Even in high school or when I went out 
around town."


{S7A029}
[Sara]
"It was pointless trying to escape... The only 
place I had to go back to was the research 
lab."


{S7A030}
[Sara]
"And back at the lab, the only thing waiting 
for me was more experiments and tests..."


{S7A031}
[Sara]
I've never had a taste of freedom.


{S7A032}
[Sara]
"I suppose that's why I was happy about the 
accident..."


10 :

{S7A033}
[Sara]
"Maybe I shouldn't say it... I mean, everyone 
was so desperate and everything..."


{S7A034}
[Sara]
But I've never had freedom like this...

[Kid]
Sara...


11 :
That was all that I could say.

Sara's each and every word made my heart ache.

I knew that wasn't Sara's intention.


But it felt like every word of hers was a
confession to me.

Of course, I had been under surveillance as
well, but it had been nowhere near as strict.

As long as I didn't do anything out of the
ordinary, it was like there was no one there.

I had been living carefree the entire time.

But Sara had... been under Leiblich's careful
watch the whole time... She was their guinea pig.

Why hadn't I gone to help Sara earlier...?


I promised that I would... but I hadn't...


Of course, I had tried.


But everything I did was blocked by Leiblich's
far-reaching influence.

Still, I knew there could be no excuses.

Why hadn't I tried harder?

Why...?


{S7A035}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...?


12 :
Sara was calling to me.

I had been daydreaming in my own world.


13 :

{S7A036}
[Sara]
Onii-chan, thank you.

[Kid]
For what...?


{S7A037}
[Sara]
Because... you came...

[Kid]
No! I left you there by yourself.

[Kid]
I didn't... come for you.


{S7A038}
[Sara]
Yes, you did.


{S7A039}
[Sara]
And I want to thank you...

Sara said that and smiled.

The smile also seemed tinged with resignation.


{S7A040}
[Sara]
I don't care anymore...


{S7A041}
[Sara]
It's okay to die here...

[Kid]
Sara, what are you saying!?


{S7A042}
[Sara]
I've finally tasted freedom...


{S7A043}
[Sara]
And I was able to meet you.


{S7A044}
[Sara]
"If it means going back to the life I had 
before, then I'd rather..."


{S7A045}
[Sara]
Dying here and now would be... better...


{S7A046}
[Sara]
"Up until now... I never even had the freedom 
to die..."

Her words shocked me into silence.

I had no idea that Sara's life up until
then had been so hard.

But...

[Kid]
No, Sara.


14 :

{S7A047}
[Sara]
Onii-chan?

[Kid]
Don't talk like that!

[Kid]
We're going to live! No matter what!

I wasn't about to let Sara die there!

There was absolutely no way that I would
let Sara die.

[Kid]
"If you die here, then it means you've lost 
to THEM!"

[Kid]
"You're going to live! Survive! No matter 
what!"

It was my responsibility to help Sara live.

[Kid]
Sara, let's go.

I said...


15 :

{S7A048}
[Sara]
Where?

[Kid]
To the ocean surface.


{S7A049}
[Sara]
How?

[Kid]
We'll swim.


{S7A050}
[Sara]
It's impossible. The pressure will...

[Kid]
"We'll be okay. The air pressure here's been 
compressed by the water pressure."

[Kid]
We're at about 4.5 atmospheres here.

[Kid]
"Even if we go out into the ocean from here, 
our lungs will be okay."


16 :

{S7A051}
[Sara]
But still.

[Kid]
"We don't know that help will come for us. And 
even if it does, it might be too late..."

[Kid]
"Besides, it's too dangerous for us to 
stay here."

[Kid]
"Listen, Sara. We're breathing at 4.5 
atmospheres."

[Kid]
"If we stay here, we're in danger of oxygen 
poisoning or nitrogen narcosis."

[Kid]
And we have no idea how long LeMU will hold.

[Kid]
"If LeMU collapses, then we'll get dragged down 
with it..."

[Kid]
It's too dangerous to stay here.

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
.........


17 :

{S7A052}
[Sara]
Hey...

[Kid]
What?


{S7A053}
[Sara]
You know I can't swim, right?

[Kid]
"You'll be okay. You're kind of swimming 
right now, aren't you?"

[Kid]
"You'll just have to remember the lessons 
I gave you."


{S7A054}
[Sara]
But... it isn't the same.


{S7A055}
[Sara]
I'm just floating right now.


{S7A056}
[Sara]
It's different than swimming in the ocean!

[Kid]
Sara, you'll be okay! Don't worry!

[Kid]
I'll lead you.

[Kid]
I'll pull you all the way.


18 :

{S7A057}
[Sara]
No... It's not possible.

[Kid]
We can do it.

[Kid]
Believe in your brother.

[Kid]
I came here... I came to help you, Sara!


{S7A058}
[Sara]
Onii-chan...

[Kid]
Sara, believe in me.

Sara clasped the pendant she was wearing
around her neck.

[Kid]
Let's go, Sara!


19 :

{S7A059}
[Sara]
Okay, onii-chan!


20 :
I pulled Sara along with me, and we left the
infirmary.

We moved from air pocket to air pocket, looking
desperately for a place where the wall had
collapsed in.

When we finally found a tear big enough
for us to squeeze through, we doubled back
to the nearest air pocket.

We took a number of short breaths to boost the
oxygen level in our blood.

Finally, taking a big breath, I grabbed
onto Sara's hand and led her through the hole
and into the ocean.


21 :
With the walls and floor gone, I lost sense of which
way was up and which way was down.


But soon, I saw a faint light in the water above.

I held Sara under my arm and headed for that
light.

I desperately thrashed my legs and swam with
my broken arm.

The water pressure was slowly pushing the air
from my lungs.

Sara's face was twisted in pain.

I was in agony.

Still, I swam, struggling to pull Sara toward
the light.

I kept kicking, believing that everything would
be okay if I could make it to the source of the
light.

Even if all of the oxygen was squeezed out of
my lungs, I was not about to let Sara die there.

That thought kept me moving.


22 :
Slowly. Gradually.

23 :
The light was getting bigger.


24 :
Sara's arms squeezed me in desperation.

Hoping to give Sara courage, I gripped her
tighter with my left arm.

As if in response, Sara gave me a smile and
started trying to swim upward.

I matched her movements, swimming desperately.

(Come, Sara...)


25 :
(Let's go...)

26 :
(Toward the light...)


27 :
I was never going to let Sara go again.

I was never going to leave my precious sister
behind.

Never again...

Sara...
