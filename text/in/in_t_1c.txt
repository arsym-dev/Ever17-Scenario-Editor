1 :
We arrived at Zweiter Stock‡Lthe second floor.

Sora gave us 30 minutes of free time.

But that still didn't mean we could go running
around as we pleased.

So we decided to randomly hit some of the
rooms and search them.


2 :
Sora held her hands out in front of her, and a
holographic window appeared.


3 :

{T1C000}
[Sora]
"Unlike the floor below, all of the scanning 
sensors on this floor seem to be functioning 
normally. This floor appears safer as well."


4 :

{T1C001}
[Sora]
"Oh, Komachi-san is on this floor... She seems 
to be walking in the vicinity of the elevator."

[Takeshi]
You can tell that?


5 :

{T1C002}
[Sora]
"Yes. I will work in the security office while 
monitoring everyone's activities. If a problem 
arises, I will announce it via the intercom..."


{T1C003}
[Sora]
"And if something happens, please contact me 
immediately."


6 :

{T1C004}
[Y¤u]
"Alright. Okay then. Let's split up and meet 
in the security office in half an hour."


7 :

{T1C005}
[Kid]
Okay.


{T1C006}
[£o¢o]
Okie dokie~


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!

[Takeshi]
Sure. Whatever.


8 :
After closing the holographic window, Sora
went into a room a little way down the
corridor. Apparently, that was the security
office.


9 :
Everyone headed out in a different direction
from the corridor intersection.

I took my PDA out of my pocket and pushed the
button.

It was recharged, and the backlight was working
without a problem.

I reset the time.

After that, I tested it a number of times, but
it didn't seem to be able make a call or go
online.

(Maybe I ought to give up using this to get
in touch with the outside...)

I pushed the PDA back into my pocket.

I had thirty minutes left.

I was trying to decide which area of the park
to visit first.

10 :
{11:0-87}
{11:2-d0}The dolphin merry-go-round

{11:2-d1}The souvenir shop

{11:2-d2}The security office


11 :
I headed to the room with the attractions.

There was a carousel there.

Instead of horses, it had a dolphin theme...


It looked like its official name was
'Delphinkarussell'.

With no visitors around, the merry-go-round seemed a
little spooky and very lonely.

Even the dolphins themselves looked sad.


12 :
[Takeshi]
Whoa!

Suddenly, a happy melody started, and the ride
began to rotate.

Of course, no one was riding it...

All of a sudden, it no longer seemed so
lonely, but that much more spooky.

[Takeshi]
Wh-wh-wh-what is this?

[Takeshi]
Watch out! This place is haunted.

[Takeshi]
Even thinking about it gives me the creeps...

Then, from somewhere, I heard someone snickering.


13 :

{T1C007}
[Y¤u]
Mwahahaha~

Y¤u came skipping over to me.


14 :

{T1C008}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari. When did you get here?

[Takeshi]
Looks like you're having a lot of fun...


{T1C009}
[Y¤u]
"But it is fun, isn't it? Doesn't it make you 
happy?"


15 :

{T1C010}
[Y¤u]
"Heehee. I always wanted to give this ride 
a whirl once."

Y¤u pointed to the merry-go-round.

[Takeshi]
Don't just turn it on without any warning!

[Takeshi]
You almost gave me a heart attack!

[Takeshi]
You surprised the heck out of me!

I shook my fist at her.

I might have been exaggerating a little, but...


16 :

{T1C011}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari, how could you be scared of a silly 
pod of wooden dolphins...?"

Y¤u looked at me sideways and grinned at me
mischievously.

[Takeshi]
"Nobody is supposed to be here in the theme 
park. It was like a horror movie!"


17 :

{T1C012}
[Y¤u]
Geez. You're such a chicken.

[Takeshi]
"Well... you were wasting energy by turning it 
on too."

[Takeshi]
What if there were a blackout?

[Takeshi]
"And we've got no idea how long LeMU's back-up 
power is good for."

[Takeshi]
"Besides, everybody knows that you should save 
energy!"


18 :

{T1C013}
[Y¤u]
"So you're not only a chicken, but a worrier 
too."

[Takeshi]
"What're you talking about? It's common 
sense..."


{T1C014}
[Y¤u]
Oh, Kuranari, so you don't know?

Next, she held her palms out and feigned
exaggerated surprise.


{T1C015}
[Y¤u]
"LeMU doesn't get any of its power from 
outside."


{T1C016}
[Y¤u]
It's all generated inside this complex.


19 :

{T1C017}
[Y¤u]
"Down more than 100 meters underwater on the 
ocean floor are thermal seafloor vents‡Lbasically 
hot springs. So LeMU takes hot 
water from there and uses it for steam."


{T1C018}
[Y¤u]
"The power of that steam is used to turn the 
turbines, and that's how we generate our power."


{T1C019}
[Y¤u]
"While LeMU is a theme park, it's also a 
closed-cycle plant and a test case for 
self-sufficient power generation."


20 :

{T1C020}
[Y¤u]
"And that's all memorized from the new 
employee manual."

[Takeshi]
I see.


21 :

{T1C021}
[Y¤u]
"I explain it in that kind of depth and all 
you can say is 'I see'?"

[Takeshi]
"I mean, what a WONDERFUL explanation, you're 
a model employee!"


22 :

{T1C022}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...


{T1C023}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari, that sure was a sexy scream you let 
out when the dolphins started moving. You 
were scared, weren't you~"


23 :

{T1C024}
[Y¤u]
I think I'll tell everyone about it...

[Takeshi]
Do what you want.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Then again, maybe you shouldn't.


24 :
The dolphins had stopped moving of their own
accord.

Y¤u explained that the ride ran for about
three minutes each time before shutting off
automatically.

We leaned against the fence surrounding the
Dolphin Carousel.


25 :
[Takeshi]
"So you only work here part-time during the 
holidays?"


26 :

{T1C025}
[Y¤u]
"Yup. I started the end of April and have been 
staying here. This is my fourth day..."

[Takeshi]
"And then, out of the blue, you get this. Pretty 
rough."


{T1C026}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari, how many times have you come to 
LeMU?"

[Takeshi]
This is the first time.


27 :

{T1C027}
[Y¤u]
"Ha. Then I've only got a three-day head 
start on you."

Y¤u laughed happily.

She sure was cheerful. I had to respect her
unflagging optimism and energy.

[Takeshi]
"You're tough... I mean, this situation is so 
depressing, and it doesn't seem to faze you."


28 :

{T1C028}
[Y¤u]
"No, I'm really not. It's just easier. I said 
it earlier, didn't I? Would you rather I get 
depressed?"

[Takeshi]
I think it's better to laugh.


29 :

{T1C029}
[Y¤u]
You're right. That's all we can do.

Then she laughed again.

I tried to force a smile.


30 :

{T1C030}
[Y¤u]
Hmmph...

Y¤u stretched like a cat.


31 :
Then she sat there and hugged her knees.

I followed suit and sat down next to her.


{T1C031}
[Y¤u]
To tell you the truth...


{T1C032}
[Y¤u]
"I came to work here because I thought my dad 
might be here."

[Takeshi]
Your dad?


{T1C033}
[Y¤u]
"Actually, my father worked in the research 
and development division of LeMU."

[Takeshi]
Research and development?


{T1C034}
[Y¤u]
"Uh, well... he worked on a computer program. 
It's the hologram that Sora uses, the LeMMIH 
terminals, and the complex control system..."


{T1C035}
[Y¤u]
"I don't know the details. He worked on all 
of it from when LeMU was first being built."


{T1C036}
[Y¤u]
Of course, he didn't do it alone.


{T1C037}
[Y¤u]
"He was one of the members involved in 
developing the project."

[Takeshi]
Huh? Is that so...?


{T1C038}
[Y¤u]
But my father...


{T1C039}
[Y¤u]
My father... disappeared one day.

[Takeshi]
...What?


{T1C040}
[Y¤u]
He just went missing...

[Takeshi]
Wh-when?


{T1C041}
[Y¤u]
He...


{T1C042}
[Y¤u]
"He's been missing as long as I can 
remember..."


{T1C043}
[Y¤u]
"It was when I was one year old, seventeen years 
ago..."

[Takeshi]
Seventeen years ago...

[Takeshi]
So you don't remember... your father?


{T1C044}
[Y¤u]
No...


{T1C045}
[Y¤u]
I've only seen pictures and movies of him...


{T1C046}
[Y¤u]
I don't really have any memories...


{T1C047}
[Y¤u]
"Everything I just told you, I heard from my 
mother..."

[Takeshi]
But why? Why did he disappear?


{T1C048}
[Y¤u]
If I knew that, I wouldn't have come here.


{T1C049}
[Y¤u]
"But the only clue to what happened is 
probably here..."


{T1C050}
[Y¤u]
The last time my father was seen was in LeMU.


{T1C051}
[Y¤u]
"So I thought that if I came here, maybe I 
would find some clue about my father..."

Y¤u hugged her knees more tightly.



32 :

{T1C052}
[Y¤u]
"My mom has convinced herself that my dad is 
already dead..."

'Dead'...

The word 'dead' had a heavy ring to it.


{T1C053}
[Y¤u]
But, you know?


{T1C054}
[Y¤u]
I believe!


{T1C055}
[Y¤u]
I know that my dad is still alive somewhere!


{T1C056}
[Y¤u]
He has to be!


{T1C057}
[Y¤u]
"My father just went missing... and his remains 
were never found..."


33 :

{T1C058}
[Y¤u]
"I heard that some of my father's research is 
being used in the new programs on some of the 
latest attractions."


{T1C059}
[Y¤u]
"There has to be a clue somewhere in this 
place about the work my father was doing..."


{T1C060}
[Y¤u]
Well, the original...


{T1C061}
[Y¤u]
The attractions are already underwater.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

After that we lapsed into silence.

I didn't know if I should say something to her.

I tried to think of what to say but didn't
hit upon anything.


34 :

{T1C062}
[Y¤u]
.........

Suddenly, Y¤u stood up.


35 :

{T1C063}
[Y¤u]
I'm kind of in the mood for some music.


{T1C064}
[Y¤u]
"Something light and fun, if you know what I 
mean."


36 :

{T1C065}
[Y¤u]
"So I think I'll get the dolphins spinning 
again~"


{T1C066}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, why don't you finish looking around?


37 :
With that, she darted away.

[Takeshi]
Hey, Y¤u...?


38 :
The dolphins started spinning again.

Y¤u didn't come back.

It looked like she had disappeared to the
corridor behind the merry-go-round.

(...I guess I'll get out of here...)

It was as if the dolphins saw me off. I left
the room behind.


39 :
{1}

{16:0}<Dolphin Carousel: Situation normal>{16:1}


40 :
Adjacent to the corridor was a little room for
visitors to rest as well as a shop selling
theme park goods.

There was a sign with the LeMU mascot on it.

That was where I had peeled the mascot
costume off of the kid.


41 :
That lemur thing called Myumyun.


In the shop were those lemur stuffed animals
next to all kinds of keychains, hologram
pendants, seafood snacks, and other stuff as
well.


42 :
That Myumyun raccoon dog mascot...

I didn't see any raccoon dog stuffed animals
next to all the keychains, hologram
pendants, seafood snacks, and other stuff.

I still had no idea what that raccoon dog was.


43 :
...The kid was sitting on the bench next to me.

He wasn't really looking at anything, but his
gaze seemed fixed.

He just kept staring at the ground.

I expected to see a hole open up in the
ground from how intensely he was staring.

He had his hands on his temples.

[Takeshi]
How's your headache, kid?


44 :

{T1C067}
[Kid]
Uh...

[Takeshi]
What's the matter? Did you find something?

[Takeshi]
Or did you remember something?


{T1C068}
[Kid]
Uh...? I... um...


{T1C069}
[Kid]
Who... are you?

[Takeshi]
"I just told you a bit ago. I introduced 
myself. I'm Takeshi. Kuranari Takeshi."


{T1C070}
[Kid]
Oh. Is that right?


{T1C071}
[Kid]
This is...?


{T1C072}
[Kid]
What am I doing here?

[Takeshi]
*Sigh*... Oh great.

It's that amnesia thing.

The kid couldn't even remember what he had
just said.

He just moved from one topic to the next,
forgetting the last.

[Takeshi]
This is the marine theme park LeMU.

[Takeshi]
Something happened and we're trapped here.


45 :

{T1C073}
[Kid]
Le... mur?


{T1C074}
[Kid]
What do you mean 'trapped'?

[Takeshi]
"That's something I would like answered 
myself."


46 :

{T1C075}
[Kid]
Uh...


{T1C076}
[Kid]
And who are you?

[Takeshi]
Kuranari Takeshi.


{T1C077}
[Kid]
Kuranari... Takeshi?

[Takeshi]
Takeshi means samurai in Japanese.


{T1C078}
[Kid]
Uh...

[Takeshi]
"Maybe you should start taking notes. You 
know, keeping track of my name, the other 
people, and where we are."


47 :

{T1C079}
[Kid]
Notes? Yeah, maybe I should...

[Takeshi]
"It looks like you understand what taking 
notes means. Take good ones. Even when you're 
eating."

[Takeshi]
"And if you can remember, you can make a memo 
of your name too."

I gave the kid a memo pad and pen I had
filched from the kiosk.


{T1C080}
[Kid]
Thanks.


{T1C081}
[Kid]
Hey, can you tell me what year it is?

[Takeshi]
You forgot that too?


{T1C082}
[Kid]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
It's 20...

[Takeshi]
...Uh, what year IS it?

I searched around in my pocket.

My entrance ticket stub was crumpled and
stuck to the back of my PDA.

[Takeshi]
"Oh, that's right! It's 2017! Take notes! 
Write it down!"


{T1C083}
[Kid]
Okay. 2017...

He was taking it down.

It looked like he hadn't forgotten how to take
notes.

[Takeshi]
Well, is there something up with the year?


{T1C084}
[Kid]
Yeah, kind of.

[Takeshi]
Kind of?


{T1C085}
[Kid]
"I thought that if I heard the year, then I 
might be able to remember at least my 
birthday."

[Takeshi]
"I see. Come to think of it, you don't even 
know how old you are, huh?"


{T1C086}
[Kid]
No...

[Takeshi]
"By the looks of it, I'd say you're not a day 
over 42."


48 :

{T1C087}
[Kid]
What!?

Surprised, the kid felt his face.

[Takeshi]
"HAHAHA! I'm kidding! Relax, there's no 
way."

[Takeshi]
"You're probably in the neighborhood
of fourteen or fifteen."

[Takeshi]
If you're eighteen, then you've got a baby face.

[Takeshi]
Geez! Don't tell me you forget your own face?


49 :

{T1C088}
[Kid]
...F-face?

[Takeshi]
"If you're worried about it, go take a look 
in the mirror. You could sketch a 
self-portrait in case you forget later..."


50 :

{T1C089}
[Kid]
Oh. Yeah... maybe I will.

(Geez. He's got it rough...)

But his serious expression had relaxed. That,
at least, was good.

[Takeshi]
"Alright. Well, I'm gonna get going. When it's 
time, you come to the security office."


{T1C090}
[Kid]
"Oh, the security office. Where is that? 
And where is this again?"


{T1C091}
[Kid]
I'm sorry. I really don't know.

[Takeshi]
"It's alright. I understand. If you don't 
come, then I'll come looking for you."


{T1C092}
[Kid]
Okay. Thanks... Takeshi.

[Takeshi]
Hey, you remembered.


{T1C093}
[Kid]
Takeshi is your name... right?

The kid had been taking notes, and sure enough,
there it was.

My name, Takeshi, on his pad, but spelled
wrong.


51 :
{1}

{16:0}<LeMU kiosk: Situation normal>{16:1}


52 :
Sora had said that she would be working in the
security office...

But I wondered what she was doing there.

Besides, she was the only one that had been
doing deskwork the whole time we'd been
trapped.

I imagined she would be getting a different
kind of tired from what we got walking
around. Mentally tired, maybe.

As I was thinking that, I knocked on the
security office door.


53 :
Knock, knock.

[Takeshi]
Hello? Sora, you there?

[Takeshi]
"Wait, this metal door is so thick you 
couldn't even hear me if you were..."

I pushed the button for the intercom on the
panel next to the door.

But Sora didn't reply.

[Takeshi]
I wonder if she isn't in there.

The door wasn't locked, so I pushed the open
button, and it opened.


54 :
The security office was small.

And it was dirty.

The front wall was packed with monitors. They
were all stained dark from cigarette smoke.

Ashtrays were stacked up like it was normal.

And there was a huge sign plastered on the
wall that said 'NO SMOKING'.

I recalled the sloppy clubroom back at
college (it had 25 years of history being
only used by guys) and couldn't help but
chuckle.

But I restrained myself and kept looking. Sora
wasn't there.

[Takeshi]
Sora?

[Takeshi]
Hey, Sora? Where are you?

[Takeshi]
"I didn't think you were the type to go 
running off without telling anyone..."

I took another step inside the room.


{T1C094}
[Sora]
Kyaaa!

[Takeshi]
Waaaa!

All of the windows in the wall monitors
opened and closed.


{T1C095}
[Sora]
Ku-Kuranari-san... when did you get here?

For some reason, the voice sounded like it
came from the shadow of the desk.

It was a blind spot, and I couldn't see Sora.

[Takeshi]
"So you are here, Sora... I thought you'd 
probably be all stressed out from the work 
and situation, so I came to take a look."

[Takeshi]
What are you doing in that weird place?

I approached the rear of the desk as I talked.


{T1C096}
[Sora]
Oh no! Kuranari-san, no! Please don't...

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T1C097}
[Sora]
I'm busy right now...

I couldn't see her face, but she sounded
embarrassed.


{T1C098}
[Sora]
"If you don't mind, can you wait outside for 
a little bit?"

She spoke hesitantly.

[Takeshi]
Oh! Are you changing?

[Takeshi]
I'm sorry...


{T1C099}
[Sora]
"Uh, no, not exactly. But I suppose it is 
something like that... Kuranari-san, you aren't 
going to change?"


{T1C100}
[Sora]
"If you don't mind employee work outfits... the 
changing room is directly behind this room. 
Just turn on the corner of the corridor and 
you'll find it."

[Takeshi]
"Nah, I'm alright. I'm just a little damp and 
uncomfortable, but I'm used to it."


{T1C101}
[Sora]
I see...


{T1C102}
[Sora]
"I'm sorry, but I'm still working and I need 
to concentrate... but I'll be done by the 
appointed time."

[Takeshi]
"I'm sorry to bother you. I'll go look around 
a little more."

[Takeshi]
Okay. Good luck.


{T1C103}
[Sora]
Thank you.

During our whole exchange, Sora was hidden,
and I didn't see her.

I waved in Sora's direction‡Lthough I
figured she couldn't see me‡Land headed for
the exit.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, it's not good for you to stay cooped up 
in here. Take a break once in a while."

I said it without looking back.


{T1C104}
[Sora]
Okay. But please do not worry about me.


{T1C105}
[Sora]
"I like my work. If I really get into it... I 
can go for days without sleep just fine."


55 :
(Days without sleep!? That's insane!)

I didn't really understand what she meant.

(But I suppose...)

(She's probably really into her job.)

I imagined that the position of system engineer was probably
just an occupation that drew 'interesting
types' and felt satisfied with that.


56 :
{1}

{16:0}<Security office: Situation normal>{16:1}


57 :
I took my PDA from my pocket and checked the
time.

There were seventeen minutes until the time Sora had
said.

I wondered where I should hit next.

58 :
{11:0-8a}
{11:2-d0}The visitor elevator

{11:2-d1}The warehouse

{11:2-d2}The infirmary


59 :
I continued to the next corner in the
corridor and hung a left.

I went in the far door, which was open.


60 :
(Huh?)

(Where am I?)

I had been aiming for the elevator, but wound
up somewhere else.

The sign said 'Qualle'.

I had no clue what that meant.

Reading the explanation, I learned that it
was a gondola in the shape of a jellyfish.


I wasn't particularly in the mood for a
ride...

I checked to see that there was no damage to
the floors or the walls and left.


61 :
The elevator was next to the Jellyfish Gondola.


62 :
[Takeshi]
Oh...

Tsugumi was standing there silently.

She was in front of the closed elevator doors
with a stern look on her face.


63 :
[Takeshi]
So this is where you were...


64 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

It looked like Tsugumi had noticed me, but she
didn't reply.

Her eyes stayed fixed on the door.

[Takeshi]
This elevator doesn't go to the surface.

I was reading a nearby sign.

[Takeshi]
"It says that to go to the floating island, 
Insel Null, we should use the elevator in the 
center of the floor."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Hey, Tsugumi. Just standing there isn't 
going to make the elevator come."


65 :

{T1C106}
[Tsugumi]
I know that.

Tsugumi finally answered me.


{T1C107}
[Tsugumi]
I know because I just saw it.

[Takeshi]
Saw what?


{T1C108}
[Tsugumi]
The elevator.

As soon as she said that, she placed her hand
on the closed elevator doors and started
prying them apart.


66 :
The door was stopped half-open. I thought it
might be broken.

Tsugumi looked inside.


{T1C109}
[Tsugumi]
"See, the elevator is stopped on the third 
floor."

Scared, I peeked in.

[Takeshi]
Oh... that's the one we rode down in?


{T1C110}
[Tsugumi]
It's still there from when we escaped.

A little box in the abyss.

The elevator was about twenty meters down.

I thought that the floors were fairly far
apart, but I didn't realize just how far.


67 :
[Takeshi]
Whoa!

Tsugumi suddenly gave a little push on my
shoulder from behind.

[Takeshi]
"Don't push... Whaddya think would happen if 
I fell from here?"


{T1C111}
[Tsugumi]
"If you fell... I think that you would die. 
Most definitely."

Tsugumi said it without a trace of emotion.

[Takeshi]
"Geez... Why do you wanna go and try to scare 
me?"


{T1C112}
[Tsugumi]
You're just a coward.


68 :
Tsugumi pulled on the doors, putting them
back in their original positions.


69 :
Just to be sure, I tapped on the elevator
button a couple of times.

There was no response. The lamp didn't light
up.

[Takeshi]
It doesn't look like it's getting any power.


70 :

{T1C113}
[Tsugumi]
"Yes. And the elevator shaft is warped. So, 
even if it was getting power, it probably 
couldn't move normally."


{T1C114}
[Tsugumi]
That's right, this elevator is useless...

[Tsugumi]
.........

After that, Tsugumi went quiet again.

Silence was the rule for a while.

Tsugumi rarely talked.

She only said the minimum necessary...

I thought that maybe she was trying to be
careful around me for some reason.

I wondered what it could be...

I wanted to know.

[Takeshi]
Hey, why don't you tell me what happened?


71 :

{T1C115}
[Tsugumi]
It's got nothing to do with you.

That might have been true, but still.

It had nothing to do with me...

It had something to do with me...

[Takeshi]
Hey, you know something I don't?


{T1C116}
[Tsugumi]
Something... like what?

[Takeshi]
Like about this accident.

[Takeshi]
Like maybe something...

[Takeshi]
"Something to do with the reason you're all 
quiet?"


{T1C117}
[Tsugumi]
Accident? This wasn't an accident...


72 :

{T1C118}
[Tsugumi]
It was planned.

[Takeshi]
What makes you say that?


73 :

{T1C119}
[Tsugumi]
Huh... You're not surprised?

Tsugumi gave me a strange look.


74 :

{T1C120}
[Tsugumi]
So you feel like something isn't right too.

[Takeshi]
Well, maybe, I guess.

[Takeshi]
Like everything is just too neat...

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"We can't communicate with the outside and our 
escape routes are all closed."

[Takeshi]
"But we've got electricity and the air 
conditioning still works."

[Takeshi]
"It's almost like someone trapped us here on 
purpose..."


75 :

{T1C121}
[Tsugumi]
"Hmmm...? I guess you're not as dumb as you 
look."

Tsugumi's expression loosened into a slight
smile.

It was a provocative smile.

[Takeshi]
What do you mean by that?


{T1C122}
[Tsugumi]
I mean exactly what I said.


{T1C123}
[Tsugumi]
You don't look that smart.

(Whhhhhhaaaaat!?)

(This chick...!)

(I'd love to tell her what I REALLY think of
her...)

That thought ran through my mind.

But I thought that could really make me look
stupid... so I resisted the urge.


76 :

{T1C124}
[Tsugumi]
This is a trap.

Tsugumi's expression returned to normal.


{T1C125}
[Tsugumi]
And you probably aren't going to get out.


{T1C126}
[Tsugumi]
"No, not just you, but everyone else as well.
All four of them."


{T1C127}
[Tsugumi]
You're all the same.

[Takeshi]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
Well, what about you then, Tsugumi?


77 :

{T1C128}
[Tsugumi]
I...


78 :

{T1C129}
[Tsugumi]
"Yeah. I suppose I could die in a place like 
this."


{T1C130}
[Tsugumi]
It wouldn't be bad at all, I guess.


79 :
Tsugumi looked upward.

The ceiling was covered with artificial
materials.

It felt oppressive...

She laughed again.


80 :
Then she left disappearing down the corridor
and I was alone.

{16:0}<Elevator: Out of order>{16:1}


83 :
There was a room with no sign indicating what
it was for.

It caught my curiosity, and I decided to have
a look.


84 :
It appeared to be a warehouse of some kind.

There were loads of boxes made of reinforced
plastic all piled up.

There was a pushcart, boxes too big to
carry, and a few long, narrow ones that a person
could manage to hold.

There were all kinds of marks, symbols, and
letters on the boxes, and I couldn't make
sense of them.

There were a bunch of round, carbon capsules
and drum-like looking objects.

I wondered what was inside them.

I figured I didn't really need to know.

There was a hissing noise coming from
somewhere.

Looking for the sound led me to an air
conditioner that was in bad shape but still
working.

On the room's ceiling was a crane complete
with guide rails.

One container was still suspended from above.
It looked like it had been abandoned in the
middle of work.

No one had had any time to clean up.

Everyone had fled at once...

[Takeshi]
Hey, is there anybody here?

I called out once, but nobody answered.

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
There's no reason anybody would be here...

There was no reply.


85 :
{1}

{16:0}<Warehouse: Situation normal>{16:1}


86 :
'Krankenstation'

I arrived in front of the infirmary.

While the place was a theme park, it was also deep
in the ocean and had other facilities.

LeMU's atmosphere was maintained using a mix
of gases at an air pressure different from
the outside world. It seemed that it could
make some people feel ill...

I reckoned that was the reason the room was
so large.


87 :
Beyond the huge sliding door was a room
decked out elaborately in shiny new medical
equipment.

I thought it could have something to do with
LeMU's sponsor being a major pharmaceutical
company.

The room was so clean and white that it was nearly
blinding.

There were two normal beds and one that
looked like it was for surgery.

There was also a huge machine attached to one
of them.

'L-MRI' was written on it.


88 :
I didn't know what it was, but it looked like
it was some kind of scanner.

I saw a shelf on the wall filled with medical
tools and medicine.

It was probably in case somebody fell ill or
got injured here. It wouldn't be possible to
move anyone outside, so they would have to be
treated on-site.


89 :

{T1C131}
[???]
Yeah. I don't think there's any way out now.

(!?)

I was getting used to surprises, but the voice
startled me.


90 :
I didn't know who was talking.

But somebody sure was.


{C1S296}
[???]
Everybody?


{C1S297}
[???]
Help...? Did you come to help?

It sounded like £o¢o...

But I didn't know who she was talking to.

I couldn't tell where they were.


{C1S298}
[£o¢o]
But... it's probably impossible...


{C1S299}
[£o¢o]
There is... no way out anymore...

What was she saying...?

I wondered if something had happened to £o¢o...

I carefully crept toward the rear of the room.

I noticed a squarish hole cut out of the floor.

I peered down inside.

Down below, a small lift was stopped.

It appeared that there was another room
directly below the infirmary. The voice was
coming from there.

I pushed the button calling the lift
and hopped in.


91 :
It descended slowly and silently.

I arrived below.

I noticed that the hatch there was slightly
ajar.


{C1S300}
[£o¢o]
Liar...


{C1S301}
[£o¢o]
Because... Because...

I eased closer and opened the hatch.


92 :
[Takeshi]
Who are you talking to?


93 :
£o¢o jumped as if she had been stung.

She was sitting on the bed. Nothing looked
out of the ordinary...


94 :

{T1C137}
[£o¢o]
Oh, Takepyon...

[Takeshi]
Takepyon?


95 :

{T1C138}
[£o¢o]
Yup. You're Takepyon!

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T1C139}
[£o¢o]
Pyon, pyon, Takepyon~

[Takeshi]
...Safe place, pokopon~


{T1C140}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, you got it...

[Takeshi]
I know the Ninneko Song 17.

[Takeshi]
"But it's not 'pyon, pyon'. It's 'pokopon', 
right?"


96 :

{T1C141}
[£o¢o]
Yes, yes!


97 :

{T1C142}
[£o¢o]
But...

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


98 :

{T1C143}
[£o¢o]
£o¢o.

£o¢o pointed to herself as she said her name.


99 :

{T1C144}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon.

Then she pointed at me.


100 :

{T1C145}
[£o¢o]
And Pipi is three years old.


{PIPI_02}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

A puppy face peeked out from under the bed.


{T1C146}
[£o¢o]
Nice to meet you~

[Takeshi]
Oh, nice to meet you too!

[Takeshi]
"...But haven't we already introduced 
ourselves...?"


101 :
I returned upstairs with £o¢o.

[Takeshi]
So you're calling me 'Takepyon'. Is that it?


102 :

{T1C147}
[£o¢o]
Yup.


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

[Takeshi]
Alright. I got it.

[Takeshi]
So who were you talking with, £o¢o?


{T1C148}
[£o¢o]
What?

[Takeshi]
Wasn't someone just in that room?


{T1C149}
[£o¢o]
No. Nobody was there.


103 :

{T1C150}
[£o¢o]
I was just playing around with Pipi~


{T1C151}
[£o¢o]
Pyon, pyon, Takepyon~


104 :
Whatever...

I didn't think £o¢o would lie to me.

There wasn't anyone else around.


105 :
{1}

{16:0}<Infirmary: Situation normal>{16:1}


106 :
[Takeshi]
Now...

I took my PDA from my pocket and checked the
time.

[Takeshi]
Oh no!

We were only two minutes late, but still, we
were late.


107 :
I jogged toward the security office.

£o¢o and Pipi were close behind me.

We went in through the sliding door.


108 :

{T1C152}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, you're late!

Y¤u was standing like a guard in the narrow
entranceway.

The kid was next to her.


{T1C153}
[Kid]
Yeah. I got here a little before you...

[Takeshi]
Sorry. My bad. I was late.


{T1C154}
[Y¤u]
"You know that in a group and in our 
situation we have to be punctual, right?"

[Takeshi]
"Don't get so mad. It's only two minutes, give 
or take."


109 :

{T1C155}
[Y¤u]
"But two minutes could make all the 
difference in the world."


110 :

{T1C156}
[£o¢o]
I was late too!


111 :

{T1C157}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, £o¢o. You didn't get lost or have any 
problems? You're alright?"


112 :

{T1C158}
[£o¢o]
Yup. I'm fine. I came straight here.


113 :

{T1C159}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that's good.

[Takeshi]
"...You're sure treating her a lot different 
than me..."


114 :

{T1C160}
[Sora]
"Well, everyone made it here in one piece, so 
that should be sufficient."

Sora looked up from the LeMMIH terminal and
smiled. She walked toward us.

[Takeshi]
So everybody's here...

[Takeshi]
What about Tsugumi?


115 :

{T1C161}
[Tsugumi]
I'm here...

Tsugumi was leaning against the lockers on
the far side of the room.


{T1C162}
[Tsugumi]
"If you've found out anything new, I'd like 
to hear about it. Did you?"


116 :

{T1C163}
[Sora]
Ah, yes. I will tell you.


{T1C164}
[Sora]
"First, there are a few things I want to 
review..."


117 :
Sora gave us a lecture about the structure of
LeMU.


118 :

{T1C165}
[Sora]
"LeMU has three layers below the ocean's 
surface."


{T1C166}
[Sora]
Erster Boden, Zweiter Stock, Dritter Stock...


{T1C167}
[Sora]
"There are seventeen meters between each floor. 
If you go down a floor, then you go seventeen 
meters deeper."


{T1C168}
[Sora]
"Thus, the third floor, Dritter Stock, is 51 
meters deep."


{T1C169}
[Sora]
"Outside of Dritter is a total of six atmospheres 
of pressure‡Lfive atmospheres water pressure 
and one atmosphere air pressure."


{T1C170}
[Sora]
"Even if, hypothetically, you were to suddenly 
go out into the ocean from Dritter..."


{T1C171}
[Sora]
"Your lungs would be crushed to about 
one-sixth of their size, and approximately 
five-sixths of them would be flooded. 
You would likely die in a matter of minutes."

[Takeshi]
Uh, I've got a question.


{T1C172}
[Sora]
Go ahead...

[Takeshi]
"I've heard that skin divers can dive to 
depths of about 30 meters. Couldn't somebody 
just tough out the water pressure on the way 
up?"


{T1C173}
[Sora]
"The current world record for free diving is 
150 meters."


{T1C174}
[Sora]
"With an aqualung and pauses along the way, 
probably just about anyone could dive around 
35 meters."


{T1C175}
[Sora]
"However, the air sent to your lungs would be 
highly pressurized gas."


{T1C176}
[Sora]
"But with skin diving, they don't stop to 
breathe along the way. Amateurs can't 
make it past 20 meters."

[Takeshi]
Wow. Is that right?


{T1C177}
[Sora]
And there is one other important thing.


{T1C178}
[Sora]
"Even if you could withstand five atmospheres of 
water pressure..."


{T1C179}
[Sora]
"Could you really swim over 
51 meters to the surface?"

[Takeshi]
You making fun of me?

[Takeshi]
"Hey, I may not look like it, but in high 
school, I swam a kilometer."


{T1C180}
[Sora]
"But aren't you talking about swimming on the 
surface?"


{T1C181}
[Sora]
"Swimming 51 meters across something is 
nothing like swimming 51 meters up something."


{T1C182}
[Sora]
I am talking about 51 meters in height.


{T1C183}
[Sora]
"It would be the equivalent of swimming a 
fifteen-story building."

119 :
{11:0-8d}
{11:1}Satisfied with the explanation

{11:1}Unsatisfied with the explanation


120 :
Swimming a fifteen-story building...?

That was insanity.

Even from Zweiter Stock, at a depth of 34
meters, that would be about ten stories.

Just climbing that would be challenging.

And besides, how would one get outside of
LeMU in the first place...

[Takeshi]
"Yeah. You're right. That's something that 
just guts alone couldn't get you through."

I nodded.


121 :
[Takeshi]
But wait!

I persisted.

[Takeshi]
"That's still the same distance, right? It's 
just vertical instead of horizontal."

[Takeshi]
I'd just have to try extra hard...

[Takeshi]
"And with float rings or something buoyant it 
would be even easier..."


{T1C184}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari. How fast do you think you 
could run 50 meters on mattresses?"

Y¤u suddenly shot me the question.

[Takeshi]
Why mattresses?


{T1C185}
[Y¤u]
Because. Just answer the question.

[Takeshi]
Fifty meters. Maybe six or seven seconds.


{T1C186}
[Y¤u]
"So how about if the mattresses were piled on 
you?"

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


{T1C187}
[Y¤u]
"How long would it take to get them off of 
you?"

[Takeshi]
How would I know? I've never tried that.


{T1C188}
[Y¤u]
Think you could do it in seven seconds?

[Takeshi]
You know I couldn't!

[Takeshi]
"Running on something and taking them off of 
you are two different things."

I gasped.

[Takeshi]
...Oh, I get it...


{T1C189}
[Y¤u]
Now do you finally see?


122 :

{T1C190}
[Tsugumi]
"And the ocean is pitch black. It would be 
suicide."


{T1C191}
[Sora]
That is correct.


123 :

{T1C192}
[Sora]
"There is something else I want to say. It is 
an announcement..."


{T1C193}
[Sora]
"I am still working to gather information and 
reconnect LeMU's communication network with 
the outside; however..."


{T1C194}
[Sora]
"All cable, radio, and network functions are 
down due to malfunctions, physically severed 
cables, or flooding."


{T1C195}
[Sora]
"I cannot provide an estimation of when we 
will be in touch with the outside."


{T1C196}
[Sora]
"Sonic communication to the outside is also 
down."


{T1C197}
[Sora]
"Therefore, I have not been able to dispatch 
an SOS."


{T1C198}
[Sora]
That concludes my report...


124 :
Two hours had passed.

There was no sign of help.

If there were people up on the floating
island, the least they could do was send
someone to check on us...

I was trying to be upbeat about things, but
with the first floor flooded and the
partitions shut, no one was going to be coming
through there.

And coming through the ocean... That seemed
even more impossible.

The flooding of LeMU had disrupted the flow
of the currents around it.

It would be hard for a diver or small
submersible to get anywhere near it.


125 :
We left behind the security office that
reeked of smoke and gathered in front of the
souvenir stand.


126 :

{T1C199}
[£o¢o]
Ready... Go!


{PIPI_25}
[Pipi]
Ggrrrr.


{PIPI_26}
[Pipi]
Waff.

[Takeshi]
...Heeee.

[Takeshi]
Ahahahaha!


127 :

{T1C200}
[£o¢o]
Yeah! That's another win for Pipi.


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*.

I had just finished my 34th match against Pipi.

And I had lost 34 times.

It was a pretty one-sided affair.

[Takeshi]
Is there any way that Pipi could lose?


128 :

{T1C201}
[£o¢o]
Oh, are you making excuses?

[Takeshi]
"First off, you're the one who's making 
Pipi's face all funny. I can't make faces 
that crazy by myself."


{T1C202}
[£o¢o]
"Well, there's no other way to do it. Pipi 
can't make faces alone."


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

[Takeshi]
"Besides, I don't know how to make a dog 
laugh, so it's not really fair."


129 :

{T1C203}
[£o¢o]
"Well... that's just something you have to get 
used to."

I wondered if it was really just about getting used to
it.


130 :

{T1C204}
[£o¢o]
Pipi laughs when he's happy. Right, Pipi?


{PIPI_04}
[Pipi]
*Woof*, *woof*!

[Takeshi]
"Well, I'll just have to admit defeat. Kid, 
you wanna take my place?"


131 :

{T1C205}
[Kid]
Me?

[Takeshi]
Yeah. I'm begging you. I'll be the referee.

The kid had been talking with Y¤u, but he came
over.


132 :

{T1C206}
[£o¢o]
Alright! Game time!


{T1C207}
[Kid]
Don't be too hard on me.


133 :

{T1C208}
[Sora]
"Oh, what game are you playing? It looks 
fun..."


134 :
Sora, who appeared taken with the game, also
came over.

[Takeshi]
It's a staring contest, canine versus human.


135 :

{T1C209}
[Sora]
Well, that seems pretty incredible.

Sora covered her mouth with her hand and
giggled.

[Takeshi]
"Actually, Pipi is incredible... I think I'm 
gonna have nightmares about this."

I shuddered.


136 :
[Takeshi]
"And now, in their first contest, we have the 
champion Pipi versus the challenger, The Kid, 
facing off in a face fight..."

[Takeshi]
I want to get underway, but first...


137 :

{T1C210}
[£o¢o]
Let's hurry up and do this.

[Takeshi]
"Well, I think we need to decide what we're 
going to call the kid here. Is 'Kid' okay? 
What do you think?"


138 :

{T1C211}
[Kid]
Well, I don't know...


139 :

{T1C212}
[£o¢o]
We could call him Kiddo.


140 :

{T1C213}
[Kid]
Uh... Um... Sure.


{T1C214}
[£o¢o]
Kiddo~ Kiddo~ Kiddo~

[Takeshi]
"Kiddo, huh... You want me to call you that 
too? There's gotta be a more normal name than 
that."

[Takeshi]
John.

[Takeshi]
It'd be fitting to call him John Doe.


141 :

{T1C215}
[Sora]
"But wouldn't calling him that just because it's fitting be 
rude to all of the people named John Doe?"

[Takeshi]
"Well, it's only for a little while, so it 
doesn't have to be perfect."


{T1C216}
[Sora]
"Kuranari-san, I thought you wanted a more 
name-like name than Kiddo."


142 :

{T1C217}
[£o¢o]
Well then... £o¢o will think up another name!


{T1C218}
[£o¢o]
Kiddo's other name could be...


143 :

{T1C219}
[£o¢o]
"Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Hora Juan 
Novecino Maria de Los Remedios..."


{T1C220}
[£o¢o]
"Siburiano Critiano de la Santeshima 
Trinidado Luis Picasso!"

[Takeshi]
"That's too long! Anything longer than 
Tanaka Yubiseiharukana is out!"


144 :

{T1C221}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari! Don't just go blurting out my 
full name..."

Y¤u, who had been standing over by the shop,
came walking directly toward me.


145 :
[Takeshi]
Ah! What a pain!


146 :
[Takeshi]
"In honor of the mascot, I name you 'Earl Myun 
of Hamburger'!"


147 :
[Takeshi]
"In honor of the mascot, I name you 'John 
Raccoon Dog Smith'!"


148 :
[Kid]
.........


149 :

{T1C222}
[Sora]
That's crude, Kuranari-san...


{PIPI_03}
[Pipi]
*Woof*?


150 :

{T1C223}
[Sora]
"Well, let's see. Why don't I think of one... 
How about Melos-san?"

[Takeshi]
Why Melos?


151 :

{T1C224}
[Y¤u]
Like, short for 'memory loss'?

[Takeshi]
Nah, it's bad luck to name him that...


{T1C225}
[Sora]
Sorry. I didn't mean to be so direct...


152 :

{T1C226}
[Tsugumi]
What are you all bickering about?

Tsugumi cut in.


{T1C227}
[Tsugumi]
"If we come up with some random name, it'll 
be a hassle when he remembers his real one."


{T1C228}
[Tsugumi]
He is a kid...


{T1C229}
[Tsugumi]
So why don't we just stick with 'Kid'?

The conversation had come full circle.


153 :
The lights suddenly went out and then flashed
back on.

There was a dull, heavy metallic echo...

At the same time, there was a slight tremor.


154 :
[Takeshi]
What's that?


155 :

{T1C230}
[Tsugumi]
That tremor felt like it came from below...


{T1C231}
[Y¤u]
Below? I wonder if something happened below?


{T1C232}
[Sora]
I will try to investigate.

Saying that, Sora held her hands out in front
of her.


156 :

{T1C233}
[Sora]
Oh...!

Just then, a strong lateral vibration jolted
the floor.

The holographic window that Sora had conjured
vanished.


157 :

{T1C234}
[Y¤u]
Sora!


158 :

{T1C235}
[Sora]
"It's alright... The monitor is back online. 
I am initiating a scan..."


159 :

{T1C236}
[Sora]
"Water has penetrated the material storage 
space in Sector Six of Dritter Stock."

[Takeshi]
"It's flooding? I didn't see any signs of 
that when I made the rounds..."


160 :
Boom, boom, boom...


161 :
The sound of metal giving way accompanied the
massive shaking.

Scenes from old movies of luxury liners being
swallowed by the ocean flashed across my mind.


162 :

{T1C237}
[Sora]
"There is damage to the passageways 
connecting the sectors."


{T1C238}
[Sora]
Multiple leak areas, and it's increasing.


{T1C239}
[Tsugumi]
Hey...


{T1C240}
[Tsugumi]
"Don't you think we should grab hold of 
something?"


{T1C241}
[Y¤u]
"Yes. Everyone grab something and steady 
yourself!"

[Takeshi]
O-okay.


163 :
I reached out for a support pillar nearby.

£o¢o crouched down as she squeezed Pipi
tightly.

Everyone held their breath.


164 :
Boom, boom, boom...


165 :
Boom, boom, boom.


166 :
Bam!


167 :
A huge shockwave rocked us.

The whole floor, or rather the whole of LeMU
shook.

I thought I would be thrown into the ceiling
one second or pulverized into the floor the
next.


168 :
The souvenir shop in front of me trembled.

The display of dishes in the shop fell to the
floor and shattered...

The pile of empty cans clattered and gave
way...

A stuffed animal made a beeping noise as it
fell on its stomach.

We all steadied ourselves against the shaking.

All we could do was endure it.

No one said anything.

We could hear the squeal of steel twisting.


169 :
Boom, boom, boom.


170 :
Boom, boom, boom...


171 :
Finally, the sound seemed to get farther away.


172 :
The vibrations also gradually subsided.


173 :
Sora announced that the second wave of
flooding had finished.

Still wary, we headed downstairs.

We carefully moved forward down the wet and
slippery stairs.

With every step, the scent of seawater seemed
to grow stronger.


174 :
We arrived at Dritter Stock‡Lthe third floor.


The water level in the corridor reached
around my shin...

It must have been around fifteen centimeters deep.


175 :

{T1C242}
[Y¤u]
LeMU can't pump out all this water?


{T1C243}
[Sora]
It appears not.


{T1C244}
[Sora]
"All major areas where leaking has occurred 
have been closed off by shutting a partition; 
however, water is continuing to flow in 
through small ducts even now."


{T1C245}
[Sora]
"The water-clearing pumps are operating at 
full capacity, but to make the water level 
recede..."

[Takeshi]
"The big hole will have to be plugged. Is 
that what you were gonna say?"


{T1C246}
[Y¤u]
"But with the partition shutting off the 
sector of the original leak, there's no way 
to access it..."


{T1C247}
[Sora]
Yes, that is so...


176 :
We entered the central control room.


177 :
Sora checked the damage via the LeMMIH console.


178 :

{T1C248}
[Sora]
But I must sincerely apologize...


{T1C249}
[Sora]
"Even though the second flooding was about to 
occur, I failed to notice and warn you all..."

As she manipulated the keys, Sora bowed her
head, looking deeply apologetic.

179 :
{11:0-8f}
{11:1}Everybody makes mistakes

{11:1}It's not your fault, Sora


180 :
[Takeshi]
Everybody makes mistakes.

[Takeshi]
"We may have even overlooked the cause of 
this when we were checking around a little 
bit ago... We're in this together."

[Takeshi]
"Everyone is fine, so let's just consider 
ourselves lucky."


{T1C250}
[Sora]
I am really sorry...

Sora answered without looking away from
the monitor.


{T1C251}
[Sora]
Thank you for being so kind, Kuranari-san.

[Takeshi]
It's nothing...

I scratched the tip of my nose.


181 :
[Takeshi]
It's not your fault, Sora. It was an accident.

[Takeshi]
"We may have even overlooked the cause of 
this when we were checking around a little 
bit ago... We're in this together."


182 :

{T1C252}
[Sora]
Not at all!

Sora answered without looking away from
the monitor.


183 :

{T1C253}
[Sora]
"My calculations and predictions were 
irresponsible..."

[Takeshi]
"Don't you go trying to blame yourself for 
this."

[Takeshi]
"Everyone is fine, so let's just consider 
ourselves lucky."


184 :
[Sora]
...


185 :
With her head bowed in silence, Sora kept
working.


186 :
Finally, her hands stopped typing on the keyboard.

Sora turned and stood up.


187 :

{T1C254}
[Sora]
"I have gauged our situation. I will now 
display it."


{T1C255}
[Sora]
"Everyone, please do not be shocked or let 
this get you down..."


188 :

{T1C256}
[Y¤u]
"Sora, when you say it like that, it makes us 
nervous."


189 :

{T1C257}
[Sora]
Oh, I'm sorry...


{T1C258}
[Y¤u]
"Still, I'm fairly confident that there are 
few things that will shock me."


190 :

{T1C259}
[Sora]
I see. In that case...

I thought everyone was probably numbed by
what we had experienced so far.


191 :
{1}

[Sora]
"Simply put, the cause of the second influx 
of water we experienced a short while ago..."


{T1C261}
[Sora]
"The sectors that were able to avoid damage 
during the first flooding were isolated from 
the flooded sections, and forced ventilation 
created a sudden reduction in air pressure."


{T1C262}
[Sora]
"However, the inundated sectors were not able 
to withstand the weight of the water and 
tilted, causing a rupture of the joint in the 
adjacent sector."


{T1C263}
[Sora]
"The gap in the internal and external air 
pressure caused seawater to be sucked into 
the complex through the rupture."


{T1C264}
[Sora]
"So, many of the sectors that were stable 
until that moment were instantly flooded..."


192 :

{T1C265}
[Sora]
"That is the current situation of Dritter 
Stock."


{T1C266}
[Sora]
"This blinking area is the central control 
room. And..."


193 :

{T1C267}
[Sora]
This is the status of Zweiter Stock.

[Kid]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
You serious?


{T1C268}
[Y¤u]
You mean nearly half of LeMU is underwater.


194 :

{T1C269}
[Sora]
"There are three sectors in Dritter that are 
not flooded."


{T1C270}
[Sora]
"The area displayed in the center of this map 
is Sector Eight, where we are."


{T1C271}
[Kid]
"Huh? It looks like the map is displaying 
roughly two areas, but where's the third 
sector?"


{T1C272}
[Sora]
"Actually, due to a flaw in the system, a 
detailed map cannot be displayed..."


{T1C273}
[Sora]
"One part of Sector Four, diagonally above 
Sector Eight, is stable."


{T1C274}
[Kid]
There's no way to get there?


{T1C275}
[Sora]
Correct. It is impossible.


{T1C276}
[Kid]
Why?


{T1C277}
[Sora]
"Because all of the corridors connecting the 
sectors are submerged."


{T1C278}
[Sora]
"In terms of distance, it is roughly 100
meters."


{T1C279}
[Sora]
"I don't think there is anyone among you that 
is capable of swimming 100 meters without 
breathing."


{T1C280}
[Sora]
Therefore, I say it is impossible.


{T1C281}
[Sora]
"Furthermore... even if someone did reach 
Sector Four, I don't think it would improve our 
situation at all."


{T1C282}
[Kid]
?


{T1C283}
[Sora]
Sector Four is in the same predicament as here.


{T1C284}
[Sora]
"All of the emergency stairs to get to the 
floating island are completely flooded."


{T1C285}
[Tsugumi]
So even going there would be a waste?


{T1C286}
[Sora]
That is correct.


{T1C287}
[Kid]
Well, then there's nothing we can do...


{T1C288}
[Tsugumi]
So we should forget about Sector Four.

[Takeshi]
"We'll just have to sit quietly and wait for 
help to come."


195 :
[Takeshi]
Well, I guess we can take it easy for now.

I left the room and hit the food stand,
snagging some cola for everyone.

[Takeshi]
"Alright, cola time! I'm gonna toss everybody 
one! Ready?"

[Takeshi]
Oops. I got one, two, three, four...

[Takeshi]
Five... I'm one short!


196 :

{T1C289}
[Sora]
Oh, I don't need one.

[Takeshi]
"Oh, don't worry about it. I'll go get one 
more. You can have mine."


{T1C290}
[Sora]
"No, really. I'm fine. I'm not thirsty, and I 
don't really like cola..."

Sora smiled.

[Takeshi]
Well, in that case...


197 :
I tossed out a cola to everyone in order.

Y¤u, Tsugumi, and the Kid all took one.


198 :
But then the Kid started shaking his can!


199 :
[Takeshi]
S-stupid! What do you think you're doing?


200 :

{T1C291}
[Kid]
Huh?

[Takeshi]
"If you do that, it's going to explode 
everywhere!"


{T1C292}
[Kid]
R-really? Is it dangerous?

[Takeshi]
Did you forget that cola is carbonated?


201 :

{T1C293}
[Kid]
I'm sorry.

[Takeshi]
Geez. I'll give you mine. Here.

I switched cans with him.

That time, the Kid slowly lifted the tab
without shaking the can.


202 :
Fushaaaww!

The cola erupted powerfully. The rest of us
hurriedly jumped to get out of the way.

The Kid got a blast of cola in the face.


203 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
"Hey, are you alright? Just so you know, that 
wasn't my doing..."


204 :

{T1C294}
[Kid]
This cola... it's sweet...


205 :

{T1C295}
[Y¤u]
Oh, guys! You should be more careful.

Y¤u said as if she were at her wit's end.


{T1C296}
[Y¤u]
"These cans contain special gas so that they can 
be used at six atmospheres."


{T1C297}
[Y¤u]
"Weren't you listening when they said that the 
bringing in and taking home of canned 
beverages was strictly prohibited?"

[Takeshi]
"Whoa! I didn't know that! I must have missed 
it!"


206 :
It was true. Normally, the inside of the LeMU
complex was maintained at six atmospheres using
a mixture of gases.

Since the floor's pressure had lowered to one atmosphere
and the gas in the cans was still highly
pressurized, the gap in pressure with the
surrounding atmosphere made them burst when opened.


207 :

{T1C298}
[Kid]
I didn't know that.

The Kid wiped his face with a nearby towel.

[Takeshi]
"...Hey, Kid. No one would expect you to know 
that."

[Takeshi]
"Y¤u, you've gotta tell an amnesiac these things 
ahead of time..."


208 :

{T1C299}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, alright. I didn't notice until 
after the fact."


209 :
[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
Huh? £o¢o, what's wrong?


210 :
£o¢o was embracing Pipi and looked downcast.

Thinking about it, I realized that £o¢o
hadn't said anything for a while.

It didn't seem like her.


211 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, aren't you going to drink your cola?

I held out a can of cola in front of £o¢o.

[Takeshi]
"It's a little warm, but it's the best I can 
do."


{T1C300}
[£o¢o]
I don't want it...

£o¢o mumbled that.


212 :

{T1C301}
[£o¢o]
I don't feel very good...


213 :

{T1C302}
[£o¢o]
I've been thinking about it since before...


{T1C303}
[£o¢o]
"And I haven't been able... to think of any 
jokes..."

[Takeshi]
Jokes?

I peered down at £o¢o.

She didn't look too good.

She was sweating and having a hard time
breathing.

[Takeshi]
Hey, you don't look very good...


{T1C304}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari, get outta the way!


214 :
Y¤u came rushing over to £o¢o, pushed me out
of the way, and put her hands on the girl's
shoulders.


215 :

{T1C305}
[Y¤u]
£o¢o... Do you have a headache?


{T1C306}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, a bit. I feel kinda dizzy...


{T1C307}
[Y¤u]
Does it hurt if you swing your arms around?


{T1C308}
[£o¢o]
Just a little...

But it looked like it hurt more than 'just a
little'.

216 :

{T1C309}
[Sora]
"I suspect it might be decompression 
sickness due to the sudden loss of 
pressure on this floor."


{T1C310}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, it could well be.

Pipi looked up at £o¢o worriedly.


217 :

{T1C311}
[Y¤u]
"Let's get her to the Zweiter infirmary. 
Kuranari, carry her."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


218 :

{T1C312}
[Y¤u]
On your back! Hurry up and squat down!

[Takeshi]
Alright, alright!


{T1C313}
[Y¤u]
I want you to carry £o¢o!

[Takeshi]
I got it! You don't have to scream in my ear!


219 :
We were rushing up to Zweiter Stock, some
seventeen meters above us.

I held £o¢o on my back, with Y¤u and
Tsugumi supporting her from the sides.

Sora led the way, and the Kid brought
up the rear.


220 :
We emerged at the second floor emergency
corridor.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, are you sure we shouldn't take a normal 
corridor?"


221 :

{T1C314}
[Sora]
"Please proceed straight ahead. This is a 
shortcut."


222 :
The emergency corridor was directly connected
to the lift below the infirmary.

[Takeshi]
Whew! We made it. Let's get her up there.


{T1C315}
[Sora]
"No, Kuranari-san. Please go ahead into that room 
there."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


223 :

{T1C316}
[Sora]
"This is a medical compression chamber. We 
can treat decompression sickness here."


{T1C317}
[Y¤u]
Just let her sleep there.

[Takeshi]
Okay, I got it.


224 :
£o¢o lay on the bed.

Tsugumi and the Kid stood next to me and
looked down at £o¢o.


225 :
[Takeshi]
"So, Y¤u, what are you gonna do in this tiny 
room? Isn't it a little cramped for examining 
her?"

The space was so small that we could hardly move
with everyone in there.


{T1C318}
[Y¤u]
I'm not going to do anything.

[Takeshi]
...What're you talking about?


{T1C319}
[Y¤u]
"We're going to have £o¢o relax in this room 
for a while."

[Takeshi]
?

I tilted my head, confused.


{T1C320}
[Sora]
"This is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Allow me 
to explain."


226 :

{T1C321}
[Sora]
"Decompression sickness occurs when there is 
a sudden change in the surrounding air 
pressure and gas bubbles that can't be 
discharged accrue in the body."


{T1C322}
[Sora]
"Gas becomes air bubbles, and these gather in 
tissues or veins. When gas bubbles remain 
inside the body, the oxygen respiration 
efficiency drops dramatically."

[Takeshi]
"So... no matter how many deep breaths you 
take, it feels like you're suffocating?"


227 :

{C1T901}
[Sora]
"That is correct. But also, if any nitrogen 
which had dissolved in the blood turns to gas, 
it could produce a thrombus, or blood clot."

{C1T902}
[Sora]
"Of course, this could hinder blood circulation, 
which is very dangerous..."

{T1C324}
[Sora]
"So we will seal this room and pump in a high 
concentration of oxygen, slowly taking it up to 
approximately three atmospheres..."


{T1C325}
[Sora]
"After that, we slowly decompress it back down to 
one atmosphere."


{T1C326}
[Sora]
"Using this difference in pressure, we 
dissolve the gas bubbles in the body 
back into the blood, where they are 
removed naturally by breathing."

[Takeshi]
"So basically, you make us like a can of cola 
that won't blow up..."


{T1C327}
[Sora]
Yes, precisely.

[Takeshi]
Okay, I got it.

I lifted my hand.

[Takeshi]
"Gosh, that dash up the stairs sure wore me 
out..."

I heaved a breath.


228 :

{T1C328}
[Sora]
Oh, Kuranari-san, are you in pain at all?

[Takeshi]
"Huh, me? My muscles feel kinda sore, and I'm 
a bit sluggish, but..."


229 :

{T1C329}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari, don't you think you should 
probably go in the room too?"


{T1C330}
[Y¤u]
"In light cases of decompression sickness, 
you aren't necessarily aware of it 
immediately."

[Takeshi]
"After you figure out you're in trouble, it's 
too late...?"


{T1C331}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. And the symptoms can be drawn out.


{T1C332}
[Sora]
"Yes... Just to be on the safe side, I want you 
all to enter the room."


230 :
The decompression process took place over
several hours.

£o¢o lay on the only bed.

The Kid, Y¤u, Pipi, and I sat next to her.

It was cramped...

We were like sardines in a can. There was
nowhere to move.


231 :
I wondered what time it was...

I took out my PDA and checked.

11:54 p.m....

I was sleepy.

£o¢o was sleeping, and her breathing was
relaxed. It looked like she was doing better.

It didn't look like Y¤u or the Kid were
sleeping, but they sat quietly with their eyes
closed.

Pipi had crawled under the bed.

Sora had sealed the hatch from outside and was
adjusting the pressure as necessary.


232 :
[Takeshi]
"Sora, what about you? Don't you need to be 
treated?"

Before the process had started, I had asked
Sora that.


{T1C333}
[Sora]
No. I'm used to this...


{T1C334}
[Sora]
"Oh, also... Everyone, please remove your voice 
converters during the repressurization process."


{T1C335}
[Sora]
"They are designed to protect your eardrums 
from the change in air pressure; however, 
during pressurization, they can interfere."


233 :
I removed the earphones that I had become
completely used to and held them in my hand.

Sora still stood just outside the hatch window.

Tsugumi... wasn't inside or visible outside
the room. She had left just before the
pressurization process had started.

234 :
{11:0-91}
{11:1}Where did Tsugumi go?

{11:1}When was Sora going to sleep?


235 :
Where the heck did Tsugumi go, anyway?

Just before the hatch was closed, she had
suddenly started talking.


236 :

{T1C336}
[Tsugumi]
Uh...


237 :

{T1C337}
[Tsugumi]
I'm leaving.

[Takeshi]
Hey, where are you going?


238 :

{T1C338}
[Tsugumi]
"There... is a place that I just realized I 
need to go to."

[Takeshi]
Where? Treatment is more urgent than that.


{T1C339}
[Tsugumi]
I don't need it.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, that's irresponsible and selfish!


239 :

{T1C340}
[Tsugumi]
"I can't stay cooped up in this cramped 
place..."


{T1C341}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, I won't go escaping alone, so just 
take it easy."

[Takeshi]
That's not the point.

[Tsugumi]
.........


240 :

{T1C342}
[Tsugumi]
"To be blunt, I don't have the patience for 
you. Any of you."

Tsugumi ignored Y¤u and me and went off
somewhere.


241 :
Sora had reported to us that she was
somewhere on the floor and safe...

But it still bothered me a bit.

But it was Tsugumi, after all. I was sure she'd
probably be back in a little while saying
something else.

That was what I thought, but nearly two hours
had passed.

(I'll wait just a little bit longer...)


242 :
When was Sora going to sleep?

This simple doubt jumped into my mind.

She was doing minute, complex work nonstop,
and she was always on her feet.

Maybe she never got tired...

When I spoke with her over the interphone and
asked her if she was alright, she laughed
and said she was just fine.

And she was still standing outside the room
as if she were a sentinel guarding it.

Her back was straight and she never slouched,
always looking like she was at attention.

I wondered if what she had said about being
fine not sleeping days on end was true...

(That really bothers me...)

I thought that I'd follow up on it later.


243 :
Even as I thought that, my eyelids got
heavier and heavier.

(But still... even so...)

(Today... really was... an eventful day...)

And then I fell away into slumber.
