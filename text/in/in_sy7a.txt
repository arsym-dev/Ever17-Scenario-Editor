1 :
Daybreak. The date had changed to Sunday,
May 7th.

Since that time, we hadn't slept at all.

I was starting to feel bad again.

It felt like a headache, dizziness, nausea, and
chills were seeping out from deep
in the core of my body.

I suffered from a wave of dull pain and
extreme fatigue... I was only half-conscious.

Exhaustion... I had reached my limit.

But I tried to keep my energy from being
sapped away.

Surrounded by darkness and endless fear, we
had fought our way so far...

And there was no sign that things were going
to get better.

Communication lines with the outside were
still down.

And...

We had yet to find a clue leading to possible
escape.


2 :
Y¤u remained distant and spacey.

Our optimistic leader that helped us through
the days of distress was nowhere to be seen.

Someone had to save her...

But who?

Of course, it was up to me.

At that point, I was the only person who could
help her.

Besides...


3 :

{Y4A061}
[Y¤u]
Promise?

[Kid]
Yeah, I promise.


4 :
The memory of that pledge remained stark in my
mind.

[Kid]
Uh, Sora...?


5 :

{Y7A000}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it?

[Kid]
"I'm sorry to ask, but could you leave me 
alone with Y¤u for a second?"


{Y7A001}
[Sora]
Certainly.

[Kid]
When we're done, I'll call you.


{Y7A002}
[Sora]
Okay.

[Kid]
I'm really sorry.


{Y7A003}
[Sora]
Please don't worry about it.

[Kid]
Thanks.


6 :
Sora vanished.

All traces of her completely disappeared.

Sora, who had no dimensional limits, had
removed herself from our field of vision.

Then...

Before continuing, I went to set the coffee
machine to make fresh coffee.

[Kid]
Y¤u? You're drinking coffee, right?

[Y¤u]
.........

Ignoring her lack of response, I set it to
prepare two cups.

Then I sat down beside her.


7 :
[Kid]
"About your mother... I mean, I don't know what 
to say, but..."

[Kid]
"Don't you think it's important to talk 
things over with her?"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"There may have been some reason why she did 
what she did..."

[Kid]
"Look, she did say she'd explain everything 
once you're back on the floating island."

[Kid]
So...


8 :

{Y7A004}
[Y¤u]
"How dare you say that... like you know how 
this feels."

[Kid]
.........


{Y7A005}
[Y¤u]
There's nothing left for me to say to her.


{Y7A006}
[Y¤u]
Besides, it doesn't matter anymore...


{Y7A007}
[Y¤u]
I don't care what happens...

[Kid]
"Look, we've still got to find a way to escape 
this place... somehow."


{Y7A008}
[Y¤u]
Why?

[Kid]
Because I made you a promise.


{Y7A009}
[Y¤u]
"How are you going to keep it? Do you have 
some great plan to get us out of here?"

[Kid]
Well that's... what I want to figure out...


9 :

{Y7A010}
[Y¤u]
Hmmph...

[Kid]
Listen, we have to survive.

[Kid]
"Y¤u, over these last seven days, I've learned 
so much from you."

[Kid]
In so many ways I can't even begin to count.

[Kid]
"But out of everything I've learned from you, 
the most important thing is..."

[Kid]
How to live.

[Kid]
"You have to live life to the fullest. That's 
what you've taught me."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
So I want to put that lesson into practice.

[Kid]
I want to live! To the fullest, to the end!

It was a heartfelt plea.


{Y7A011}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kid...

[Kid]
Yeah?


{Y7A012}
[Y¤u]
What does it... mean to live anyway?

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
Well, living means...

[Kid]
To learn and to know, I think.

A child is born in innocence... gains knowledge
through the years... only to forget it all when
it is old... and dies.

Over the previous seven days, my life had been
filled with things that I had learned.

From amnesia and emptiness, my life began.

But looking back over the previous seven days,
there was one more thing...

[Kid]
"I also think that to live means... to 
lose something."

They said, 'Nothing ventured, nothing gained',
but to gain something, you had to lose something.

Like me losing the past by losing my memory.

Even though I had lost much... I had also
gained...


{Y7A013}
[Y¤u]
Living means... to learn? And to lose something?


10 :

{Y7A014}
[Y¤u]
"So you're saying that we live only to get 
hurt?"

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
Maybe. I don't know.


11 :

{Y7A015}
[Y¤u]
Well...


{Y7A016}
[Y¤u]
If living means to be hurt...


{Y7A017}
[Y¤u]
Then I've had enough...


{Y7A018}
[Y¤u]
I've had more than my share of hurt.


{Y7A019}
[Y¤u]
And I've had enough of life... so...

[Kid]
W-wait a second!

[Kid]
What are you trying to say, Y¤u...!?

[Kid]
You're not saying you want to die...?

[Y¤u]
............

[Kid]
............

[Kid]
"You can't be serious! What the hell's that 
all about!?"

[Kid]
"I can't believe you're saying that! It's not 
like you at all!"

[Kid]
"What happened to the Y¤u a little while 
ago... who was so ready to get out of here? 
What happened to that Y¤u?"

[Y¤u]
..........

[Kid]
Come on, what gives...?

[Kid]
What came over you all of a sudden...?

[Kid]
Why do you think you were born anyway...!?


12 :

{Y7A020}
[Y¤u]
Stop it...


{Y7A021}
[Y¤u]
"Would you stop with the stupid two-bit
sermon... "

[Kid]
No, it's you who's talking stupid...

[Kid]
"All this selfish crap, as if your life 
belongs only to you!"


13 :

{Y7A022}
[Y¤u]
That's not what I was thinking!


{Y7A023}
[Y¤u]
I don't think that, it's just...


{Y7A024}
[Y¤u]
"All this time, the mother who I thought 
brought me into this world... She's gone."

[Kid]
"But that other lady said she was your real 
mother."


{Y7A025}
[Y¤u]
Well, she's obviously lying!

[Kid]
How do you know?


14 :

{Y7A026}
[Y¤u]
Because...


15 :

{Y7A027}
[Y¤u]
...She's been lying to me from the start...

[Kid]
"Don't you think that's a little pointless 
right now?"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
I mean, you do understand, don't you...?

[Kid]
"That until you hear her side of the 
story... you can't go jumping to conclusions."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"I think you should live the best life you 
can for all the people around you who care 
about you."

[Kid]
"For your mother... and for Sara and Takeshi as 
well..."

[Kid]
And for me...


16 :

{Y7A028}
[Y¤u]
...For you?

[Kid]
"I said it before, but there's so much that 
I've learned from you."

[Kid]
I'm so very grateful to you.

[Kid]
Really.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"Y¤u, you're a friend, a guardian, a 
teacher..."

[Kid]
And...

[Kid]
And...

[Y¤u]
......

I walked back to the coffee machine and poured
two cups of coffee.

[Kid]
"You said earlier that you've already lived 
enough, right?"

[Kid]
But I don't think it's enough.

[Kid]
"Because I think there's still stuff you need 
to learn."


{Y7A029}
[Y¤u]
...You mean about my mother?

[Kid]
That's one thing, yes.

[Kid]
By the way, how much sugar do you take?


17 :

{Y7A030}
[Y¤u]
Ah, I...

Not listening, I added two spoonfuls.

[Kid]
"I was thinking... Don't you think sugar in 
coffee reminds you of something?"


{Y7A031}
[Y¤u]
?

[Kid]
You know, something that life depends on.


18 :

{Y7A032}
[Y¤u]
Huh...?

[Kid]
Do you have any idea?


{Y7A033}
[Y¤u]
I guess not.

[Kid]
That's the second thing you don't know about.


19 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Makes you want to know, doesn't it?


{Y7A034}
[Y¤u]
A little... I guess.

[Kid]
"Well, if we get out of here alive, I'll tell 
you what it is."

I added milk and sugar, then carried the two
cups over.

[Kid]
There you go.


20 :

{Y7A035}
[Y¤u]
...Thanks.

Y¤u took the cup and silently sipped from it.


[Kid]
How does it taste?

[Y¤u]
.........

Were my feelings...

...Finally getting across to her?


21 :

{Y7A036}
[Y¤u]
It's... very sweet.

She had a clear gentle smile, like the sun
shining just after a rain.


22 :
I called Sora back into the room. All
survivors remaining inside the park were
present.

The three of us began to discuss new
strategies.

The walls of LeMU would only hold two more
hours at most.

Our last possible escape route had been shut
off, filling with floodwater just a few hours
earlier.

All hope of communicating with the outside was
gone.

The situation had become so desperate that I
could no longer expect Y¤u or Sora to find an
escape route.


{Y7A037}
[Y¤u]
Isn't there anything we can do...?

Y¤u lifted the coffee cup to her lips as she
spoke.

Her cup contained only black coffee.
She had refilled it herself.

Watching her drink, I went to take a sip from
my own cup, but found it empty.

To pour myself more, I walked back to the
coffee machine.

The machine... was an interesting contraption
with a lower chamber containing boiling water
heated from an alcohol lamp.

The water was siphoned up the central pipe
into the upper chamber by the pressure
of the steam.

Siphon...

Siphon......

Siphon.........


23 :
[Kid]
I got it!

[Kid]
"Sora? Could you show me that cross-sectional 
diagram again!?"


24 :
[Kid]
"What's this perpendicular line coming 
straight down from the floating island?"


{Y7A038}
[Sora]
It's an emergency stairwell.

[Kid]
This area wasn't dry earlier...?


{Y7A039}
[Sora]
"No, but I was able to drain it yesterday, 
so..."


{Y7A040}
[Sora]
"When the flooding started, the watertight 
doors in the emergency stairwell automatically 
closed."


{Y7A041}
[Sora]
"Therefore, the emergency stairs did not allow 
water in after it had finished draining."


{Y7A042}
[Sora]
"It was thanks to the safety doors closing 
automatically that Kuranari-san, Matsunaga-san, 
and Komachi-san survived."

[Kid]
"How far is it from this room to the emergency 
stairwell?"


25 :

{Y7A043}
[Sora]
Approximately 80 meters.

[Kid]
Really... 80 meters... huh...?

[Kid]
"I just want to confirm this, but... if you were 
to climb those emergency stairs, you could 
escape up to the floating island, right?"


{Y7A044}
[Sora]
That is correct.

[Kid]
"And... the safety doors to the emergency 
stairwell can be opened manually..."


{Y7A045}
[Sora]
It is possible.


{Y7A046}
[Y¤u]
S-slow down, Kid! What are you saying?

[Kid]
What I'm saying is...

[Kid]
"To escape by going through the emergency 
stairwell... maybe..."


{Y7A047}
[Y¤u]
"There you go again! Coming up with another 
stupid idea!"


{Y7A048}
[Y¤u]
Look right here!


{Y7A049}
[Y¤u]
Can't you see the blue color there?

[Kid]
So?


{Y7A050}
[Y¤u]
"That means the corridor leading to the 
emergency stairs is totally under water!"

[Kid]
Yeah, I know that.


{Y7A051}
[Y¤u]
Come on! You can't be serious...


{Y7A052}
[Y¤u]
"There's no way you're thinking about swimming 
there, are you?"

[Kid]
"Ah... I think that's the first time I've ever 
heard you make a mistake."

[Kid]
I wasn't going to say that.

[Kid]
"There's no way I can swim 80 meters under 
water!"


{Y7A053}
[Y¤u]
"Well, how do you expect to reach the 
emergency stairs then?"


26 :
[Kid]
"First, let's call the emergency stairwell 
that connects to the floating island 
'Staircase A'."

[Kid]
"Then let's call the Sector Four emergency 
stairwell here 'Staircase B'..."

[Kid]
"And the emergency corridor connecting to 
'Staircase A' will be 'Corridor C'."


{Y7A054}
[Y¤u]
And?

[Kid]
"The point is that we need to drain the water 
out of the corridor, right?"

[Kid]
"Once that's done, we could just skip our 
way to 'Staircase A'."


{Y7A055}
[Y¤u]
"You say it as if it's the easiest thing 
in the world, but... there's no way we can 
do it, if you ask me."

[Kid]
We can do it!


{Y7A056}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, how?


{Y7A057}
[Y¤u]
"First of all, there isn't anywhere to drain 
the floodwater in 'Corridor C'."

[Kid]
But there IS a place.

[Kid]
The dry area in Sector Four.


{Y7A058}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*... Are you really that dumb?


{Y7A059}
[Y¤u]
"Water only flows from high to low with the 
help of gravity."


{Y7A060}
[Y¤u]
"This is the third time you've made me say 
that."

[Kid]
I know, I know.


{Y7A061}
[Y¤u]
So why do you keep up this stupid argument...


{Y7A062}
[Y¤u]
"What? Are you thinking about scooping out all 
that water with a bucket?"

[Kid]
Not scooping it out.

[Kid]
Just the opposite.


{Y7A063}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
"We're going to release the floodwater from 
Sector Eight!"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........


27 :

{Y7A064}
[Y¤u]
"Kid... Can I ask you one simple little 
question?"

[Kid]
Sure.


{Y7A065}
[Y¤u]
"Wouldn't doing that put this security office 
and the entire surrounding area completely 
underwater...?"

[Kid]
That's right.


28 :

{Y7A066}
[Y¤u]
"*Sigh*... I should have noticed the warning 
signs..."


29 :

{Y7A067}
[Y¤u]
It's okay. There, there, Kid...


{Y7A068}
[Y¤u]
There's nothing to worry about now...


{Y7A069}
[Y¤u]
Everything's going to be okay...


{Y7A070}
[Y¤u]
I'll take care of you...


{Y7A071}
[Y¤u]
Now, be a good little boy...

Y¤u started patting my head.

I snapped with anger.

[Kid]
Alright then! I'll prove it to you!


30 :
I dashed out and ran to the warehouse.

I found a bucket and a clear plastic hose, then
drilled a hole in the bucket.

Sticking the hose into the hole, I used duct
tape to wrap and seal it.

I then hunted up two more buckets.

With the goods in hand, I returned to the
security office.


31 :

{Y7A072}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What's... that...?

[Kid]
"It's something I threw together to test my 
idea."


{Y7A073}
[Y¤u]
"I don't get it. What does that thing have 
to do with what we were talking about?"


32 :
[Kid]
"Listen. First, this bucket up here, the one 
with the hose stuck in it... It represents 
Sector Eight, where we are, okay?"

[Kid]
"Next, the hose part that's filled with water 
represents Corridor C leading to Staircase A."

[Kid]
"Finally, the bucket set down low represents 
the fourth block on the third floor. And the 
empty hose part hanging down to it is 
Staircase B."

[Kid]
"Just to let you know, the bent hose part 
represents the connecting corridor joining 
up Corridor C with Staircase B, okay?"


{Y7A074}
[Y¤u]
Uh... Okay.


{Y7A075}
[Y¤u]
I got you so far... So then what?


33 :
[Kid]
"Before I show you, I want to make sure of one 
thing. If we drain the water filling the hose 
here, then we can move safely to the emergency 
stairs, right?"


{Y7A076}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, I guess.

[Kid]
Alright! Let the draining begin!


{Y7A077}
[Y¤u]
?

[Kid]
Remember what I said earlier?


{Y7A078}
[Y¤u]
"I think you said... 'We're going to release 
the floodwater from Sector Eight', right?"

[Kid]
So let's release it.


34 :
Next, I began to pour water into the top
bucket from a second bucket which I had
filled with water from the corridor.


35 :
Glug, glug, glug...

In no time at all, the top bucket was full.


36 :
Next, the water from the top bucket flowed
down the hose, pushing the air out of the hose
and flowing into the lower bucket.


37 :
Before long... all the water was drained.

Except for a negligible amount left in the
hose, all the water from the top bucket
drained completely to the lower bucket.


38 :
[Kid]
And that's how it works.

[Kid]
This is how a siphon works.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"Okay, let's prove this one more time by 
looking at the map."


39 :
[Kid]
"The walls of Staircase A, Staircase B, 
Corridor C, and the area in Sector Four are all 
intact without cracks or damage."

[Kid]
"So we can assume that all these areas are 
protected from outside seawater."

[Kid]
Isn't that right, Sora?


{Y7A079}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Kid]
"Given that those areas don't have cracks or damage,
what will happen if we simultaneously open 
all the watertight doors in the submerged 
area in Sector Eight of Zweiter Stock?"


{Y7A080}
[Y¤u]
"An enormous amount of water is going to 
flow into Corridor C?"

[Kid]
And then, what next?


{Y7A081}
[Y¤u]
"The water accumulated in Corridor C will 
drain into the dry area in Sector Four?"

[Kid]
And then what will happen?


{Y7A082}
[Y¤u]
"Probably something like your experiment just 
now..."


{Y7A083}
[Y¤u]
"All the water in Corridor C, as well as 
Sector Eight, will flow into Sector Four, I guess."

[Kid]
Yep, that's the plan.


{Y7A084}
[Y¤u]
But do you really think it'll work?

[Kid]
It's a hell of a lot better than nothing.

[Kid]
I'm pretty sure it'll work.


40 :
And then...


41 :
[Kid]
Are you ready to go?


42 :

{Y7A085}
[Y¤u]
Sure.

According to the color-coded map on the
monitor, Zweiter Stock's Sector Eight and Corridor
C had changed to green.

The color green meant it was a dry area.

Meaning the drainage... had worked perfectly.


{Y7A086}
[Sora]
"There is very little time left before the 
estimated implosion time. You must hurry."

[Kid]
Yeah, we know.


{Y7A087}
[Sora]
Well, be careful.

[Kid]
...Huh?

[Kid]
What about you, Sora? You're not coming?


43 :

{Y7A088}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kid. Sora... can't leave LeMU.

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
...Huh?


{Y7A089}
[Sora]
"Have you forgotten? I am an RSD-generated 
image... I'm just a computer program."

[Kid]
.........


{Y7A090}
[Sora]
I am not able to join you.


{Y7A091}
[Sora]
"So I wanted to say goodbye and wish you the 
best of luck."

[Kid]
Sora...


44 :

{Y7A092}
[Sora]
Every encounter must have a parting.


{Y7A093}
[Sora]
"And even if I accompanied you as far as the 
floating island, we would eventually have to 
say goodbye there."


{Y7A094}
[Sora]
"In my case, the parting comes a little 
earlier than with everyone else."

[Kid]
But...


{Y7A095}
[Sora]
"Kid-san, think about it like this. When you go to 
visit a friend's house..."


{Y7A096}
[Sora]
"When it's time to leave, the friend may see 
you to the door, but the friend can't 
accompany you home, right?"


{Y7A097}
[Sora]
This place...


{Y7A098}
[Sora]
LeMU is... my home.

[Kid]
We'll meet again, won't we?


45 :

{Y7A099}
[Sora]
Yes.


{Y7A100}
[Sora]
"I am here, and I am also elsewhere at the 
same time."


{Y7A101}
[Sora]
"Even if the 'me' here disappears, the 'me' 
there will still go on existing."

[Kid]
Don't talk about disappearing.


{Y7A102}
[Sora]
Heh heh. This is merely an example, you see.


{Y7A103}
[Sora]
"Don't worry. I'm sure that I'll meet 
you and Tanaka-san again."


{Y7A104}
[Sora]
And it may be sooner than you think...

[Kid]
Do you promise?


{Y7A105}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Kid]
It's a promise then?


{Y7A106}
[Sora]
Yes, it's a promise.

Looking over Sora's shoulder at the monitor, I
could see the number of life readings
displayed there.


46 :
Y¤u and I opened the security office doors and
exited into the corridor.

Giving a wave to the smiling Sora as she saw
us off, we climbed the stairs to the emergency
corridor.


47 :
We then walked down Corridor C, which was no
longer flooded.

[Kid]
Hey, I was just thinking, but...


48 :

{Y7A107}
[Y¤u]
What about?

[Kid]
"Surely Sora isn't planning to take 
responsibility for the accident by dying 
here..."


49 :

{Y7A108}
[Y¤u]
"Don't be stupid... Sora doesn't plan to 
sacrifice herself."


{Y7A109}
[Y¤u]
Sora, you know, is different from us.

[Kid]
No way! Sora's not...


50 :

{Y7A110}
[Y¤u]
Umm... I don't mean it that way, umm...


51 :

{Y7A111}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, what you're worried about isn't going 
to happen to her."

[Kid]
How can you be so sure?

[Kid]
Maybe that's the way Leiblich programmed her?


52 :

{Y7A112}
[Y¤u]
*Sigh*... Here we go again...


53 :

{Y7A113}
[Y¤u]
"Listen, this is what I heard from Mayo, 
but..."


{Y7A114}
[Y¤u]
"Before, when she was hacking the source data, 
Mayo said she rewrote one line of code."


{Y7A115}
[Y¤u]
"In Sora's programming, there's a priority 
list of preferential actions. Mayo rewrote 
one of these."

[Kid]
What was that?


{Y7A116}
[Y¤u]
Above all else...


{Y7A117}
[Y¤u]
She must value herself most.


54 :
At last, we arrived at the door leading to the
emergency stairs.


{Y7A118}
[Y¤u]
Alright, I'm going to open it!

[Kid]
Okay.

Y¤u put her hand on the door's handle.


{Y7A119}
[Y¤u]
Come on! Help me turn it!

[Kid]
Oh... right.

Together, we gripped the handle.

‡LIt was then that it happened!


55 :
Claaaaang...

Suddenly, a low metallic sound resounded behind us.

I turned around quickly.


56 :
[Kid]
Ah!

At the end of the corridor... stood the girl.

Her eyes met mine.

And then a name flashed in my mind, as clear
as a bell.

[Kid]
...£o¢o!


{Y7A120}
[Y¤u]
Huh!?


{Y7A121}
[Y¤u]
£o¢o... Who's £o¢o!?

Turning on her heels, £o¢o ran off in the
other direction.

I turned to chase after her.

But Y¤u grabbed my arm, holding me back.

[Kid]
C'mon, let go!

[Kid]
There's still someone here!

[Kid]
We can't just leave her here!


{Y7A122}
[Y¤u]
"You're just imagining things! Forget about 
it!"

The walls began to creak and groan.

Here and there, water began to leak in.

[Kid]
£o¢oooo!


{Y7A123}
[Y¤u]
Kid! Stop!


57 :
Tearing myself away from Y¤u's grasp, I ran
after the girl.

Y¤u came dashing after me.

Through the voice alternator came Sora's
warning.


{Y7A124}
[Sora]
"The pressure on the partitions has increased 
beyond their limit!"


{Y7A125}
[Sora]
You must return quickly!

[Kid]
No way!


{Y7A126}
[Y¤u]
How long!? How much longer will they hold!?


{Y7A127}
[Sora]
Ten to fifteen minutes!


{Y7A128}
[Sora]
But it could implode at any time!

For one instant, I saw the back of the girl.

She continued to run down the corridor.

With all my strength, I burst after her.


58 :
The main building lights flickered and went
out, then were replaced by dim emergency lights.

With the help of the pale lights, I kept up the
chase.


59 :
I bounded down the emergency staircase...


60 :
And burst out into a normal corridor.

I ran and ran with all my power.


61 :
I ran to the end of the narrow corridor in
front of a small door.

It was there that I caught up to her.


62 :
She stood with her back to the door.

I had caught her.

[Kid]
Come on, we're going together!

The girl shook her head.

Creeping forward, I pressed close to her.

But to my surprise...!

[Kid]
...Huh!?


63 :
After a moment...{1}

64 :
As if being absorbed into the door, the girl
disappeared...


65 :
Out of breath, Y¤u closed in on me.


66 :

{Y7A129}
[Y¤u]
Whew! I finally caught up with you...


67 :

{Y7A130}
[Y¤u]
And? What about the girl, or whatever?

[Kid]
............


68 :
I stood there as if in a trance.

Coming back to myself, I tried to open the
door to Himmel.

But the door wouldn't budge.

[Kid]
Sora! Open this door!


{Y7A131}
[Sora]
"That is impossible. That door is out of 
my jurisdiction."

I pounded on the door.

[Kid]
£o¢o!


69 :
Ssssssss!

From the surface of the walls, water began to
gush in.


{Y7A132}
[Sora]
"Less than five minutes left! They won't hold 
much longer!"


{Y7A133}
[Announcement]
"Emergency warning... All patrons in the 
park... and all staff... are advised to 
evacuate immediately."


{Y7A134}
[Announcement]
Five minutes... until... implosion.

The announcement repeated itself in German
and English.

[Kid]
Damn it! Open up! Open this door!


70 :
Boom! Boom! Boom! I struck with my fists.

[Kid]
Open uuuuuup!


{Y7A135}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kid, you've got to snap out of it!


{Y7A136}
[Y¤u]
Wake up!

[Kid]
Ugh...!


71 :
I pounded fiercely against the door again with
my clenched fists.

But no matter how hard I tried, it was in vain.


(Is she just... Just my imagination?)


(...If I keep this up, what's going to happen
to Y¤u...?)

Y¤u would die if I didn't do something!


[Kid]
.........


72 :

{Y7A137}
[Y¤u]
Kid...?

[Kid]
I'm so sorry... Y¤u.

I strained to speak, squeezing out my words.


[Kid]
OKAY, LET'S GO!

I reached out my hand to Y¤u.


73 :

{Y7A138}
[Y¤u]
Whew, finally...

Y¤u gave my hand a squeeze back.

[Kid]
.........


74 :
One last time, I looked back at the door...

And then turned and ran with all my might.

We sprinted as hard as our legs would carry us.

Splashing through the water as it gushed like
a waterfall, I ran with everything I had,
Y¤u's hand gripped tightly in mine.


{Y7A139}
[Announcement]
Three minutes... until... implosion.


75 :
Bounding up the emergency stairs, we reached
Zweiter Stock.


76 :
We ran hard down the emergency corridor.


{Y7A140}
[Announcement]
Two minutes... until... implosion.

We applied our strength together and pushed
open the emergency stairwell door.


77 :
Closing the door tightly, we then headed up
the long set of stairs.


{Y7A141}
[Announcement]
One minute... until... implosion.

In the distance, the sign read Erster Boden.
The first floor.

Just seventeen meters left!


{Y7A142}
[Announcement]
30 seconds...


{Y7A143}
[Announcement]
20 seconds...


{Y7A144}
[Announcement]
10, 9, 8, 7...

We ran toward the final door...


78 :
Clink, clank, clink, clank...

The door... the door wouldn't open!


{Y7A145}
[Announcement]
6, 5, 4, 3...


{Y7A146}
[Announcement]
...2... 1...


79 :
Grrrrrrrr... Groannnnnnnnnnn!


The darkness was pierced by a ferocious
sound...

Like the roar of a dragon.

Or possibly... the last agonizing cry before
death.


80 :
On the floating island.

The morning sun stained the sky, land, and
ocean...

It was the first time we had laid eyes on the
blue sky and bright sunlight in seven days.


81 :
In the distance, Sara and Takeshi played
together.

It appeared as if they were pretending to
swordfight with a couple of sticks.

Apparently, Takeshi had been routed by Sara's
sword.

I gazed dreamily at the two as they played.

Tsugumi was nowhere to be seen. After the
escape, she had disappeared.

And as for Y¤u...?


82 :
She sat beside me, gazing at the morning sun.

Her eyes misted with tears...

It was her first time to see the sun in seven
days.

Long shadows, from her figure and mine,
cast at length behind us.

Yes, we had successfully escaped from that
abyssal labyrinth.

[Kid]
I kept my promise... don't you think?

I turned and asked Y¤u.


{Y7A147}
[Y¤u]
Well, the first one at least.

Y¤u kept her gaze on the rising sun as she
answered.

The first one...

...To protect her.

And the second?


{Y7A148}
[Y¤u]
"The thing that reminds you about life, sugar 
in coffee."

[Kid]
Ah... That...


{Y7A149}
[Y¤u]
"The thing that life depends on, didn't you 
say?"

[Kid]
Uh huh.


{Y7A150}
[Y¤u]
You promised to tell me.

[Kid]
"Okay, let me ask you in that case. What are 
some things on which life depends?"


{Y7A151}
[Y¤u]
"Water, air, food, housing, 
clothing, money..."

[Kid]
Okay, what else?


{Y7A152}
[Y¤u]
Knowledge.

[Kid]
Well, I guess there's that too.

[Kid]
"Humans can't live forever in innocence, 
though."

[Kid]
"To live comfortably, humans also need certain 
impurities, things that are granted by 
knowledge."

[Kid]
"I guess you could compare those things with 
the milk you put in coffee."

[Kid]
But there's one more thing...

[Kid]
"Like the sugar in coffee, we need one more 
thing..."


{Y7A153}
[Y¤u]
What could it be?

[Kid]
How does sugar taste?


{Y7A154}
[Y¤u]
Sweet.

[Kid]
It's a wonderful taste, right?

[Kid]
So humans... can never live entirely alone.


{Y7A155}
[Y¤u]
?

[Kid]
You still don't get it?

[Kid]
"People can only know sweetness when they join 
together..."

[Kid]
Love.


83 :
Y¤u then squeezed my right hand.

And I pulled her close to me.

Y¤u buried her face in my chest.

From Y¤u's long hair, I could smell her
fragrance.

The fragrance of sunlight.


{Y7A036}
[Y¤u]
It's sweet... isn't it?

The sun, my sun, which was clear and fresh,
flowing with brilliance...

Tinged with sweetness, the smell of spring
enveloped us completely.
