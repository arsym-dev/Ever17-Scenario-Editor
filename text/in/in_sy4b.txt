1 :
I tried to organize my thoughts as I looked
for Y工.


2 :
I realized that there were six things I knew
for sure.

{16:4}

3 :
1. Y工's father, Tanaka Yoichi, had apparently
died 34 years previously.

2. And Y工's mother, Tanaka Yukie, had died 15
years previously.

3. Y工 had heard from her mother that Yoichi
had disappeared 17 years ago.

{16:4}

4 :
4. Y工's mother was still researching
archaeology at LeMU.

5. From the written records of A and B, I knew
that Yoichi and Yukie had a daughter.

6. Finally, both of her parents' deaths had
something to do with the Tief Blau virus.

{16:4}

5 :
I wondered what we could possibly find out
about those facts.


6 :
As I was walking the corridor, Sara suddenly
appeared from around a corner.


7 :

{Y4A477}
[Sara]
Hey, Kid...

[Kid]
Where's Y工?


8 :
Sara shook her head.


{Y4A478}
[Sara]
She told me she wanted to be alone.

[Kid]
I see... I wonder what I should do.


9 :

{Y4A479}
[Sara]
Kid, maybe you could go keep her company?

[Kid]
Of course I will.

[Kid]
But I wonder what I should do?


{Y4A480}
[Sara]
Go and cheer her up.

[Kid]
"Huh? I thought you said that she wanted to be 
alone."


10 :

{Y4A481}
[Sara]
"That's exactly when a guy needs to go to a 
girl and give her a shoulder to cry on."

[Kid]
But you went, and it didn't help, right?


{Y4A482}
[Sara]
"That's different. I'm a girl. 
You're a boy... Got it?"

[Kid]
It shouldn't matter.


11 :

{Y4A483}
[Sara]
"Listen... No matter how much a girl pretends 
to be strong, she's always waiting."

[Kid]
For what?


12 :

{Y4A484}
[Sara]
It's obvious, isn't it?

[Kid]
?


{Y4A485}
[Sara]
The hero who comes to save her!

(Say what?)

I was astounded.


{Y4A486}
[Sara]
Waiting and waiting and waiting!


{Y4A487}
[Sara]
Waiting for our prince on a white horse!


{Y4A488}
[Sara]
That's just the way that girls are!

Numbed by the conversation, I tried to argue.

[Kid]
I'm no hero, and I'm sure not a prince.


13 :

{Y4A489}
[Sara]
"What? Who said that they liked the name 
'Prince' again?"

[Kid]
Forget about that already...


14 :

{Y4A490}
[Sara]
Maybe you just don't like Y工.

[Kid]
That's a stupid thing to say.


15 :

{Y4A491}
[Sara]
Then go to her!

Sara pointed down the corridor.

[Kid]
Oh, alright.

Worn down by the powers of Sara's persuasion,
I gave in.

[Kid]
But just let me ask you one more thing.


16 :
[Kid]
Why me?

If just a guy was needed, Takeshi would do.


17 :

{Y4A492}
[Sara]
Because it's settled.

[Kid]
Huh?


{Y4A493}
[Sara]
I decided. Because I like you better.

[Kid]
?


18 :

{Y4A494}
[Sara]
"And I don't have many favorites. So count 
yourself lucky."

Sara let out a defiant laugh.


{Y4A495}
[Sara]
Listen up so you don't get lost.


19 :
Sara told me where Y工 was, and I went to
find her.

I spotted Y工's back from behind the
merry-go-round.

She was looking down.

She was sitting with her hand clutching the ride...

[Kid]
Y工...

Calling out to her, I went closer.

Y工 turned her face toward me, gave me an
agonized look, and spoke.


20 :

{Y4A496}
[Y工]
Please... don't talk to me right now.


{Y4A497}
[Y工]
Stay away from me.


{Y4A498}
[Y工]
"Something isn't right with me right 
now... I might say something awful..."

[Kid]
I can't leave you alone.

It was the honest truth.

[Y工]
......

I sat down near Y工.


21 :
I spoke exactly what came into my mind.


[Kid]
I remember what you said when we first met.

[Kid]
You said <I am You!>

[Kid]
I am you.

[Kid]
<You are me.>

[Kid]
We are the same.

[Kid]
You're not alone.

I was no prince on a white horse...
and there wasn't much I could do by myself...

[Kid]
"So don't struggle with this alone. Let's 
think through it together."

...But I thought that we could get through it
together.


{Y4A499}
[Y工]
Kid...

I nodded firmly.

[Kid]
So what do we know so far?


{Y4A500}
[Y工]
That my dad... might be dead.


{Y4A501}
[Y工]
"But that can't be true! Because... Because it 
happened seventeen years before when my mom 
told me!"


{Y4A502}
[Y工]
And it was sixteen years before I was born!

[Kid]
That's not all, is it?


22 :

{Y4A503}
[Y工]
"No! There's more. My mom might already be 
dead too!"


{Y4A504}
[Y工]
"It can't be! How could it? It doesn't make 
any sense!"


{Y4A505}
[Y工]
"Fifteen years ago! When I was three! Before 
I was even aware of anything!"


{Y4A506}
[Y工]
"I saw my mom running around just fine right 
before I came here!"

[Kid]
That's what you said.


{Y4A507}
[Y工]
It's not just what I said, it's a fact!

[Kid]
.........


{Y4A508}
[Y工]
What in the world...?


23 :

{Y4A509}
[Y工]
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.


{Y4A510}
[Y工]
So who raised me all this time?


{Y4A511}
[Y工]
Who was my... real father? Where did he go...?


{Y4A512}
[Y工]
I... I just don't know anymore...

Like a dam bursting, Y工 spewed out all of the
bad feelings that had been building inside of her.

[Kid]
Wait. Just calm down.


24 :

{Y4A513}
[Y工]
I'm calm enough!

[Kid]
"You're losing your composure and ability to 
judge."


{Y4A514}
[Y工]
I'm always composed!


{Y4A515}
[Y工]
Are you ready! The answer is clear!


{Y4A516}
[Y工]
"The whereabouts of my father have been 
unknown since he disappeared seventeen years 
ago, but today he's alive somewhere."


{Y4A517}
[Y工]
"My mom is alive too. She's at home, waiting 
for me."


{Y4A518}
[Y工]
"This is the truth! And it's unchangeable! 
So I don't have to prove it!"

[Kid]
Look, you're jumping to conclusions.


{Y4A519}
[Y工]
Shut up! You're as messed up as LeMMIH is!

[Kid]
Idiot! You're the one who's messed up!


{Y4A520}
[Y工]
What'd you just say!?

[Kid]
Y工, you're pretty smart, right?


{Y4A521}
[Y工]
Well, which one is it!?

[Kid]
And I thought you were strong.


25 :
[Kid]
"You were the one who said that your 
knowledge wasn't for defense, but for 
offense."

[Kid]
"It was the first time that I've ever met a 
girl who said anything like that."

[Kid]
I never thought you'd be weak like this.


26 :
[Kid]
You said that scholarship is futile.

[Kid]
"But you're the kind of person who wants more 
knowledge even knowing that."

[Kid]
That's not something a weak person could do.


27 :
[Y工]
.........

[Kid]
So why are you acting like this now?

[Kid]
"C'mon, let's just be logical and think this 
through one point at a time."

[Kid]
The way you always do.

[Kid]
"The reason you're confused is because the 
information is conflicting, right?"

[Kid]
"Because you think that part of it can't be 
right."

[Kid]
"So let's start by sorting fact from fiction, 
beginning with what you know."

[Kid]
Y工, you know a lot about a lot of things.

[Kid]
"You have the materials in your head to sort 
this thing out."

[Kid]
"You, out of anyone, should be able to tell 
what is a lie."

[Y工]
.........

[Kid]
Right?

[Y工]
...............


28 :
Y工 turned her eyes away from me and bit down
hard on her lip.

She finally looked down and closed her eyes as
if she was thinking.

I could tell she was trying hard to
accept the possibility that the
facts might be true.


29 :

{Y4A522}
[Y工]
"You're right... I don't know what was
wrong with me."

Finally, Y工 lifted her face...


30 :

{Y4A523}
[Y工]
I don't know what was the matter with me.


{Y4A524}
[Y工]
I'm sorry.

Y工 gave a little nod.

[Kid]
Alright.


31 :
At last, it was time to start deducing things.

We decided to start breaking things down with
the points that were clear.

{16:4}

32 :
Like what was Tief Blau, or TB?

Y工 explained that it was a malignant virus
that had an extremely high death rate, and that it
had ravaged the world in the past.

She said that it was first discovered more
than 30 years previously.

So, time-wise, there was nothing strange if her
father had died of TB 34 years before then and her
mother 15 years before.

{16:4}



33 :
Furthermore, the world was entirely free of TB;
a decade earlier, the World Health Organization
had officially declared that the disease was
eradicated.

{16:4}

34 :
What Y工 didn't know was when her parents were
supposed to have died.

Y工 didn't know what she was to make of that
information since it was sixteen years before
she was born.

And the mother that had raised her...

She said she had just seen her face just the
other day, but she was supposed to have died
fifteen years ago.

We figured that there were four possibilities.

{16:4}

35 :
1. Yoichi had not actually died, but only
disappeared seventeen years ago.

And Yukie was still alive.

2. Yoichi had not actually died, but only
disappeared seventeen years ago.

However, Yukie had passed away fifteen years ago.

3. Yoichi had died 34 years ago, but Yukie
was still alive and well.

4. Yoichi had died 34 years ago and Yukie 15
years ago.

{16:4}

36 :
We didn't know which was the truth and which
were fiction.

It was incredibly confusing.

We decided to consider the possibilities one
by one.

{16:4}

37 :
Those theories were based on information from
four sources.

A. A file compiled by Sora concerning the
death of Tanaka Yukie

B. The chat log from A and B (the only source
of information about Yoichi's death)

C. What Y工's mom had told her (the only
source of information about Yoichi's
disappearance)

D. The existence of Y工's mom

{16:4}

38 :
We moved to the security office and checked
the 'File Concerning the Death of Tanaka
Yukie' again.

With as much evidence as there was in the
file, it looked like Yukie's death was
indeed a fact.

We set aside the question of whether she was
actually Y工's real mother for the time
being...

{16:4}

39 :
So we were able to narrow it down to
possibilities two and four.

'2. Yoichi had not actually died, but only
disappeared seventeen years ago. However,
Yukie had passed away fifteen years ago.'

'4. Yoichi had died 34 years ago and Yukie
15 years ago.'

{16:4}

40 :
We deduced that if Yukie was dead then that
meant that Y工's mother had been lying to
her all these years.

We didn't bother ourselves about the
possibility of two women having the same name.

If we could determine that Yukie was lying,
then the reliability of her information about
Yoichi's disappearance would drop dramatically.

That would strongly boost the possibility that
the fourth theory was right.

'4. Yoichi had died 34 years ago and Yukie
15 years ago.'

{16:4}

41 :
[Kid]
Hmmmmmmmm!


{Y4A525}
[Y工]
That would mean that... both of them are...

[Kid]
No, I said wait! Quit jumping to conclusions.


{Y4A526}
[Y工]
But...

[Kid]
"You're so impatient. We're still trying to 
sort this out, right?"

Just then...


42 :
The lights started flickering on and off.

[Kid]
See, the lights agree with me.


43 :

{Y4A527}
[Y工]
Whoa... haha~


44 :
[Kid]
The lights went out...


45 :

{Y4A528}
[Y工]
Maybe they're agreeing with me.

[Kid]
...


46 :
Finally, they flashed back on.

[Kid]
It seems like the lights are in bad shape.


47 :

{Y4A529}
[Y工]
It sure does.

[Kid]
I wonder if it's another blackout.


48 :

{Y4A530}
[Y工]
"Eh? Are we going to have to make repairs 
again?"

[Kid]
Well, I don't want to either...


49 :

{Y4A531}
[Y工]
"This time, should we have Kuranari fix it 
himself?"

[Kid]
Uh, that'd be pretty low.


50 :

{Y4A532}
[Y工]
Ahaha~

The light conversation seemed to lift Y工's
spirits.

[Kid]
Okay then...

[Kid]
...Huh?

I heard a voice in the distance.


{Y4A533}
[Takeshi]
Heeeey! Y中工uu! Where are yooooou?


51 :

{Y4A534}
[Y工]
What's that? Is that Kuranari?

[Kid]
It sounds like he's looking for you.


52 :

{Y4A535}
[Y工]
Heeeey! Kuranari! I'm over here!

After a bit, Takeshi appeared.


53 :

{Y4A536}
[Takeshi]
There you are. I looked all over for you.


54 :

{Y4A537}
[Takeshi]
"Oh, and there's the Kid too. You two sure 
seem to be together a lot recently."

[Kid]
I don't know about that.


55 :

{Y4A538}
[Y工]
What? Are you jealous?


56 :

{Y4A539}
[Takeshi]
Nope. Not a bit.


57 :

{Y4A540}
[Y工]
What? Well, you should be!


58 :

{Y4A541}
[Takeshi]
Alright. Then I'm jealous.


59 :

{Y4A542}
[Y工]
"Heehee. This will blow your mind, but 
actually..."


{Y4A543}
[Y工]
Me and the Kid are dating.


60 :

{Y4A544}
[Takeshi]
Whoooooa!

[Kid]
Whaaaaaat!?


{Y4A545}
[Takeshi]
R-really!?

[Kid]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

I shook my head vigorously.


{Y4A546}
[Takeshi]
NO way, that absolutely blows my mind.


61 :

{Y4A547}
[Takeshi]
"Okay, I'll stop pretending to be surprised 
now..."


62 :

{Y4A548}
[Y工]
"Hey! Don't interrupt me! I'm supposed to give 
the punch line."


{Y4A549}
[Takeshi]
"I know what's coming next. 'I'm KIDding. 
It's a joke.' Right?"


63 :

{Y4A550}
[Y工]
Yup.


{Y4A551}
[Takeshi]
"Alright, enough of that. Let's get back 
on topic."


{Y4A552}
[Y工]
Alright...

[Kid]
And? What was it you came for?


64 :

{Y4A553}
[Takeshi]
"Uh, I'm going to go make some repairs on the 
generator. You wanna help?"

[Kid]
Repair the generator?


65 :

{Y4A554}
[Y工]
"I don't believe this. Are you saying there's 
been a blackout again?"

I didn't believe it.


66 :

{Y4A555}
[Takeshi]
"No, it's not that serious. But the generator 
isn't in the best of shape."

[Kid]
"Yeah. The lights did just go out a little bit 
ago."


67 :

{Y4A556}
[Takeshi]
See?


{Y4A557}
[Takeshi]
"No big deal, just some maintenance that's 
gotta be done."


{Y4A558}
[Takeshi]
Sora's orders.

[Kid]
I see...


68 :

{Y4A559}
[Takeshi]
Y工, will you help?


69 :

{Y4A560}
[Y工]
S-sure... I suppose...

[Kid]
.........

It seemed that Y工 still wasn't back to normal.

I could tell that she was just pretending
she was fine.

I thought that she might get hurt if I let
her go to make repairs in that state of
mind.

[Kid]
"Hey, Takeshi? I'll go with you to do the 
repairs."


70 :

{Y4A561}
[Takeshi]
What? You will, Kid?

[Y工]
.........

[Kid]
It looks like Y工 is... a bit worn out.


{Y4A562}
[Takeshi]
"But you don't know a thing about machines, 
right?"

[Kid]
It'll be fine. I'll try hard.

[Kid]
So let me help.


{Y4A563}
[Takeshi]
Hmmmm...


71 :
My desperate attempt at persuasion succeeded
and I had to help.

We started the work after lunch.

But...


72 :
[Kid]
Ouch. Takeshi, that hurts.


73 :

{S4A099}
[Takeshi]
You can take that. You're a man, after all.

Takeshi grinned sadistically as he patted my
right arm, which was supported by a cast.

The cast was made of a specially formulated
plastic. It was lighter than I had expected
and not too cumbersome.

Takeshi had put the cast on me with
instructions from Sora.

Sora said she had something else to do and
left the work to Takeshi.


74 :

{S4A100}
[Takeshi]
"Wow. That dive you took was really something 
else. Pretty impressive stuff."

[Kid]
"Be quiet! I told you my leg slipped. You're 
the one that forced the tools on me."


75 :

{S4A101}
[Takeshi]
"Don't try to pin this on me. I never said to 
bring the tools along."

[Kid]
"You're the one that sprang off without 
anything."


76 :

{S4A102}
[Takeshi]
"If we have to make repairs again, then we'll 
need the tools. So I left them there."

Takeshi was making excuses.

[Kid]
Okay, fine. It was all my stupid fault...

I looked at the cast wrapped around my right
arm.

While we were repairing the generator, I had
lost my balance holding the heavy toolbox and
fallen off the machine.


77 :

{S4A103}
[Takeshi]
"Well, don't get down about it. Sora said it's 
a clean break, so you'll be back in business 
in no time."

[Kid]
Easy for you to say...


78 :

{S4A104}
[Takeshi]
Alright, now it's time...

Takeshi picked up an object that could
easily be mistaken for a gun at a glance. It
was a syringe used to inject a cartridge
filled with a cocktail of antibiotics, fever
medicine, painkillers, and vitamins.


79 :

{S4A105}
[Takeshi]
Gimme your arm.

Takeshi put the needle against my left arm.


80 :
It turned to night.

Dinnertime rolled around.

Just like always, we filled our empty bellies
with tuna sandwiches made by Takeshi.

{16:4}

81 :
We wanted a change of pace, to do something
fun, so we spread out a blanket in the park's
rest area.

We thought it would kind of put us in
a picnic mood.

The blanket was from a shop that stocked them
on the same floor.

So it had LeMU's Myumyun label printed on it.

{16:4}


82 :
Sora couldn't eat, but she sat with us
smiling just the same.

It seemed that was fun for her.

Sara had just gone to get more drinks from the
kiosk.

Y工 wasn't around.

She didn't feel well and was resting in the
infirmary.

{16:4}

83 :
So Sara was going to take her a sandwich later.


Drawn by the scent, Tsugumi appeared.

As if she didn't notice or didn't care,
Tsugumi parked herself on Myumyun's face
and started munching on a sandwich.

Of course, Takeshi started complaining, but
Tsugumi just ignored him.

She simply sat there, eating and drinking
by herself.

I stared at her absentmindedly.

{16:4}

84 :
.........

{1}

85 :
I wondered if I was still stuck on those
words.

{16:4}

86 :


{1}{1}{1}

{S3D025}
{16:0}'On the 7th...'{16:1}


{S3D026}
{16:0}'You will die.'{16:1}

{16:4}

87 :
Ever since then, Tsugumi had mostly left me
alone.

I wondered what she was thinking about just
then.

I was mulling that over when...

{16:4}

88 :

{Y4A564}
[Sara]
Kyaaaaaa!

All of a sudden, Sara screamed from the
direction of the kiosk.


{Y4A565}
[Sara]
R-rat! Th-th-there's a rat!


89 :
Hearing that, Takeshi forgot about Tsugumi
for an instant and ran to the kiosk.

Sora and I followed him.


90 :
Some of the boxed food in the kiosk had been
damaged.

[Kid]
WHOA... what a mess!


91 :

{Y4A566}
[Sara]
Looks like these are totally damaged.

[Kid]
"I wonder if the hotdogs were the work of 
the rat too."


92 :

{Y4A567}
[Sara]
Huh? But those were in the fridge.

She was right. The stuff in the fridge was
fine.

It looked like we were in no immediate danger
of starving.


93 :

{Y4A568}
[Sora]
"Still, I'm surprised that there are rats... 
in LeMU."

[Takeshi]
.........

Takeshi, our de facto cook, was livid.

He was so mad that he couldn't speak. His face
went bright red, and his whole body shook with
anger.

94 :

{Y4A569}
[Tsugumi]
Hahahaha~

Tsugumi was enjoying it, though.

[Kid]
What's so funny?


{Y4A570}
[Tsugumi]
Of course, it's...


{Y4A571}
[Tsugumi]
...his face.


95 :
She pointed at Takeshi as she said that.


96 :
Takeshi snapped.


{Y4A572}
[Takeshi]
That lousy rodent! He pissed me off!


{Y4A573}
[Takeshi]
"If I catch that rat, I'm gonna feed him to 
the fish outside!"


97 :
Like that, a raging Takeshi set about trying to rig up
a trap to catch the rat.

And he ended up making me help him try to
design and set it up.

Going along with him was the only way to calm
him down.

I was somehow able to help him, using my one
good arm to cover for my lame one.

The trap he tried to make was a useless
contraption pieced together from stuff in the
warehouse.

I won't go the pain of trying to describe it.


98 :
We didn't finish until the middle of the night.

My mind and body were both worn out.

I headed to where Y工 was.

I was worried about her and wanted to touch
base on the theories about her parents.


99 :

{Y4A574}
[Sara]
Hey, there you are, Kid!


100 :
[Kid]
What? Do you need something?


{Y4A575}
[Sara]
Yeah. I got a message for you from Nakkyu.

[Kid]
From Y工?

[Kid]
I was just going to see her.


{Y4A576}
[Sara]
"I don't think she's in the infirmary. 
I think she headed out."

[Kid]
Is she feeling better?


{Y4A577}
[Sara]
Yup. She said she was feeling tons better.

[Kid]
Oh, well, that's good.

[Kid]
And? What's the message?


101 :

{Y4A578}
[Sara]
Uh. Oh... Yeah... It's... Um...


102 :

{Y4A579}
[Sara]
"She said she's going to THE place, and you 
should come too."

[Kid]
THE place?


103 :

{Y4A580}
[Sara]
She said you'd know what she meant.

[Kid]
.........

(THE place...)

(Did that mean...?)


104 :

{Y4A581}
[Sara]
Hey.


105 :
[Kid]
What?


{Y4A582}
[Sara]
"I don't know, but you seem to be doing alright 
for yourself."


{Y4A583}
[Sara]
"You're already sneaking dates at night 
and all."


{Y4A584}
[Sara]
You sly guy, you!

[Kid]
...?

I didn't think I knew what she was talking
about.

The theory was half-baked...


106 :

{Y4A585}
[Sara]
"By the way, what trick did you use to calm 
Y工 down?"

{Y4A589}
[Sara]
What you said or what you did.


109 :

{Y4A590}
[Sara]
"Or I guess to hear the juicy details you 
have to be over eighteen, maybe~"

What did she mean, eighteen?

[Kid]
"I don't know what you're talking about. 
I just gave her a helping hand..."


110 :

{Y4A591}
[Sara]
Wh-what? You skipped first base?

[Kid]
Huh?


111 :

{Y4A592}
[Sara]
And?


{Y4A593}
[Sara]
"Come on! It's okay! I won't tell anybody 
else."

[Kid]
...


112 :

{Y4A594}
[Sara]
You don't want to tell me?

I thought it was risky to continue the
conversation, decided to take a hint
from history, and...

'See no more, speak no more, hear no more.'

Sara finally got the idea.


113 :
Ultimately, Sara gave up. Since I figured
that Y工 was waiting for me, I started walking.

I thought about what Y工 meant by 'THE place'.

I figured it was probably...
