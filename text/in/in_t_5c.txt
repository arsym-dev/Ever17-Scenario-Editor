1 :
It was time for dinner.

I made enough sandwiches for everyone and
passed them out.

Everyone moved with them to the rest area.


2 :
We gathered on the circular stage in the
center of the room and began eating.


3 :
At a wave of Sora's hand, a gentle rain
started pouring from the ceiling sprinklers
onto the flowerbeds.

There was even a small rainbow.


4 :
Smiling, Sora stared at the fresh flowers and
the sparkling rainbow.


5 :
Her smile was so carefree...

I didn't want to think it wasn't real.

I didn't want to think she was just
pretending for our benefit.

But...

Was she really smiling because she wanted to,
or was she just trying to cheer us up?

'We don't need to save Sora. She's saved
already.'

That thought wouldn't leave my mind.


6 :
I wondered how long I could watch the little
peaceful world she had created.

How long could I keep looking at her smiling
face?

Thinking about it made me feel lonely.


7 :
Then again, there were others with me too, one
of them opening her mouth so wide that it
didn't seem it would open any more.

She looked REALLY happy.


8 :

{T5C000}
[Y¤u]
Kuranariiii~

And had flipped off the wrapping paper...


{T5C001}
[Y¤u]
I want another sandwich. Pleeeeeeaaase~


9 :

{T5C002}
[Y¤u]
"Would you be so kind as to make another one 
and bring it here...? Pretty pleeeeaaase?"

She called out to me in a voice that seemed
just a little TOO sweet.

It seemed to me that she had been crying
earlier, but it must have been my
imagination...

[Takeshi]
"Alright, alright. You're such a 
slave driver."


10 :

{T5C003}
[Y¤u]
What was that? Did you say something?

[Takeshi]
Nothing at all, milady.


11 :

{T5C004}
[Y¤u]
"Just as long as you realize who's in charge. 
Ohohohoho..."


12 :
Reluctantly, I trudged back into the kitchen.


13 :
(I can't believe that girl...)

It wasn't like they were that hard to make.

We had plenty of provisions.

Still, I was irritated as I waited
for the cold oil to heat up again.

I anxiously fidgeted as I waited.

The wire basket struck the frying pan with a
clang.

(I'll just get this done as soon as I can...)


14 :

{T5C005}
[Tsugumi]
Hey...

A 'customer' had showed up without warning.


{T5C006}
[Tsugumi]
"I'd like to ask for another one if that's 
okay."

[Takeshi]
GEEZ!


15 :

{T5C007}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what, Takeshi...?


{T5C008}
[Tsugumi]
Did I catch you at a bad time...?

Tsugumi looked annoyed.

[Takeshi]
Eh? Ts-Tsugumi!?


{T5C009}
[Tsugumi]
...Um...


16 :

{T5C010}
[Tsugumi]
You don't want to make one?

[Takeshi]
Huh? Uh, no, it's just...

[Takeshi]
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

I had to settle down...

I'd allowed myself to get worked up...

Trying to shake off my frustration, I
replied...

[Takeshi]
You just want one?


17 :

{T5C011}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, thanks. Oh yeah, one more thing...

Tsugumi said that as she turned around.


18 :

{T5C012}
[Tsugumi]
What about you, £o¢o?


19 :

{T5C013}
[£o¢o]
Hmm, I'm not sure...

£o¢o peeked out from behind Tsugumi.


{T5C014}
[Tsugumi]
What do you want?


{T5C015}
[£o¢o]
Maybe I'll eat just a little something.


20 :

{T5C016}
[Tsugumi]
Well... How about some bread?


{T5C017}
[£o¢o]
Okay, sounds good!


21 :

{T5C018}
[£o¢o]
Takepyon, I'd like some bread please~

[Takeshi]
Okay, okay. Gotcha.


{T5C019}
[£o¢o]
Thanks. Heh heh...


22 :

{T5C020}
[Tsugumi]
Um, by the way, Takeshi.


23 :

{T5C021}
[Tsugumi]
Were you upset a little bit earlier?


{T5C022}
[Tsugumi]
Are you feeling okay? Or is it...?

[Takeshi]
Nah, it's not like that.

[Takeshi]
"It just takes a while for the oil to get 
warmed up, so I was irritated, that's all."


24 :

{T5C023}
[Tsugumi]
Oh, was that it?

She flashed me a smile.


25 :

{T5C024}
[Tsugumi]
Okay. Don't worry, just take your time.


{T5C025}
[Tsugumi]
I'll be waiting.


26 :
Tsugumi grabbed on to £o¢o's hand and started
walking slowly away.

She was smiling so gently...


27 :
She had surprised me when she started talking
to me all of a sudden...

The Tsugumi right then seemed like she would
never talk about 'dying', even by accident.

I wondered if she had resolved her feelings.

If that was the case, then it seemed like
talking with her had been the right thing to
do.

I had chased after her constantly...

Been hit by her...

Been put down by her...

But the Tsugumi before me was unmistakably
one of us.


28 :
It didn't seem like she cared about my
troubles...

Every time we met, I never know how to
react... and it bothered me some.

Had she totally forgotten about the events of
the other night? I had to wonder.

(Well, if she doesn't care, then I suppose
that's best...)

The Tsugumi right then seemed like she would
never talk about 'dying', even by accident.


I decided to believe that her smile was real.


29 :

{T5C026}
[£o¢o]
"And guess what? You wanna know what? I had a 
dream last night!"

Tsugumi was listening to £o¢o intently.


{T5C027}
[Tsugumi]
What kind of dream?


30 :

{T5C028}
[£o¢o]
I was riding a whale!

£o¢o seemed to be truly enjoying herself.


{T5C029}
[£o¢o]
And Kiddo was riding on it with me...


31 :

{T5C030}
[£o¢o]
"And the whale was, like, totally bouncing all 
over the place..."


{T5C031}
[£o¢o]
I just kept hopping and jumping...!


{T5C032}
[£o¢o]
"And we were in outer space going to this 
place called Planet Squid, and were flying 
all around."


{T5C033}
[£o¢o]
And then guess what?


32 :

{T5C034}
[£o¢o]
I met someone from planet Kuikui~


33 :

{T5C035}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm... Oh really...


{T5C036}
[Tsugumi]
So you met someone from planet Kuikui, eh?


{T5C037}
[£o¢o]
Yup, yup~


{T5C038}
[£o¢o]
Kiddo and me, we both met him~


34 :

{T5C039}
[Tsugumi]
Is that so...?


{T5C040}
[Tsugumi]
That's great, £o¢o...


35 :
Tsugumi listened to £o¢o's nonsense with a
smile on her face.

I watched their interaction quietly...

I tried to sense what they were feeling...


36 :
And...


37 :

{T5C041}
[Y¤u]
Kuranariii, what's taking you so looong...!

I went into the rest area, and Y¤u was
lounging about lazily.

[Takeshi]
What the hell are you all worked up about?


38 :

{T5C042}
[Y¤u]
I'm not 'worked up' about anything.


{T5C043}
[Y¤u]
"It's just that you're so slow, I was 
wondering, 'What's taking Kuranari so long?', that's 
all..."


39 :

{T5C044}
[Y¤u]
And so? How'd it turn out, chef?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"You really don't know when to shut up, do 
you...?"

[Takeshi]
Look, it's right here, so stop worrying.


40 :
When I showed Y¤u the package, she shrugged.


41 :
Tsugumi and £o¢o had already finished theirs
and were following behind me.


42 :
I headed over to the circle in the center of
the room.

[Takeshi]
Here. It's the Tanaka special. Take it!

I got up on the round dais and threw the
package directly at Y¤u.


43 :

{T5C045}
[Y¤u]
What are you doing...!?


44 :
Splat.

The package flew over Y¤u's knees and landed
softly in the center of the stage.

[Takeshi]
Hey, come on. Wake up, will you...?

I pretended to show surprise.

[Takeshi]
"Be careful, those're some gourmet goods, you 
know?"


45 :

{T5C046}
[Y¤u]
"W-well, you're the one who threw it all of a 
sudden!"

Y¤u's cheeks puffed up.

She picked up the package and dusted it off.

[Takeshi]
Sorry, I was just joking...

I lifted both hands in mock apology.

[Takeshi]
"I was worried it would fall into the water 
there for a second."


{T5C047}
[Y¤u]
Oh, stop it...


46 :

{T5C048}
[Y¤u]
You don't have to pick on me, you know...

Grumbling to herself, she undid the string
around the wrapping.


47 :

{T5C049}
[Y¤u]
Ah!

Y¤u looked at the contents and puffed up
again.


{T5C050}
[Y¤u]
Hey, this sandwich is burnt!

[Takeshi]
"Not THAT badly. You should still be able to 
eat it!"


48 :

{T5C051}
[Y¤u]
I suppose...

[Takeshi]
Gimme a break.

We carried on needling each other like that
for a while...


49 :
When suddenly, someone came up and stood in
front of Y¤u and me.

No... maybe he'd been there for a long time.


50 :
The Kid was staring at both of us with a
leaden gaze.


51 :

{T5C052}
[Y¤u]
Hey, what's wrong, Kid?


{T5C053}
[Y¤u]
...You don't want it?

The Kid held an unopened fried tuna sandwich
in his hand.

[Takeshi]
You gotta eat to stay healthy, Kid.

[Takeshi]
"It's probably cold by now. You want me to 
heat it up again for you?"

I put out my hand.

But he pulled the sandwich close to himself
and tried to get away.

He looked at me with a hard expression...

And...


52 :

{T5C054}
[Y¤u]
What!?


53 :
The Kid...

Crushed the sandwich in his hand.


54 :
Using all his strength.

The wrapping paper burst and sauce flew every
which way.

It got on his clothes as well, but he didn't
seem to notice.

He didn't stop there...

He took the mangled package and...


55 :
Threw it with all of his might against the
water on the ground.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what!?

[Takeshi]
What the hell are you doing!?


56 :
[Kid]
.........

His shoulders trembling, the Kid kept his
face down.

He was finally able to drag out some words.


57 :

{T5C055}
[Kid]
Sick...


58 :

{T5C056}
[Kid]
I'm sick of it...!


59 :

{T5C057}
[Kid]
That's all I can take!


60 :
The Kid kicked at the thin layer of water at
his feet.

Everyone looked at him at once.


{T5C058}
[Kid]
I can't stand it anymore!


{T5C059}
[Kid]
"I don't want any more fried tuna
sandwiches!"


{T5C060}
[Kid]
I'm sick of them!


{T5C061}
[Kid]
I want to eat something else!


61 :
He screamed.

Everyone's breath caught in their throats.


62 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........


63 :
[Sora]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


64 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Pipi]
.........

But nobody had anything to say in reply.


65 :

{T5C062}
[Kid]
I'm sick...


{T5C063}
[Kid]
And tired...


{T5C064}
[Kid]
So what if we're still alive...


{T5C065}
[Kid]
"There isn't any proof that anyone is going 
to save us!"


{T5C066}
[Kid]
What we're doing here...


66 :

{T5C067}
[Kid]
Everything that we're doing here...


67 :

{T5C068}
[Kid]
There's no point...


{T5C069}
[Kid]
There isn't any point to us being here.

The Kid raised a shaking fist.

But not finding any direction to launch it, he
lowered it again.


68 :
[£o¢o]
.........

[Tsugumi]
.........


69 :
[Sora]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........


70 :

{PIPI_06}
[Pipi]
...*whine*...

Everyone tried to keep their eyes from
meeting.

It seemed like they were afraid of what they
might see...

They tried desperately to avert their gazes.

Nobody moved.

People pressed their lips firmly together and
dared not speak.

[Takeshi]
St...

[Takeshi]
"Stupid fool! What the hell are you talking 
about!?"

Finally, I looked up, shouting.

[Takeshi]
Don't ask for the impossible!

[Takeshi]
Do you have any idea what you're asking!?

[Takeshi]
"The only food we have to eat are these 
sandwiches and what's in the snack shop 
upstairs! You know that!"


71 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
And you tell me you're 'sick' of it!?

[Takeshi]
You still have to eat it!

[Takeshi]
It's the only way to survive!

[Takeshi]
So you'd better be thankful for it!


72 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
We're all putting up with it the best we can!

[Takeshi]
You're one of the gang, right?

[Takeshi]
You should be a little more cooperative...

[Takeshi]
They're all being patient.

[Takeshi]
They're helping out.

[Takeshi]
"Even if they don't like it, they eat, and 
they're surviving..."

[Takeshi]
If we don't... then we're finished!

[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
Wake up...

[Takeshi]
"We're all going to get through this 
together..."

[Takeshi]
As long as we're alive, there's still hope.


73 :
BOOOOOoooom!

Suddenly, a low metallic sound reverberated
throughout the complex.

It was a dull, muffled sound.


74 :
The floor shook slightly.

Everyone staggered slightly and struggled to
regain their balance.

But nobody tried to do anything else.


75 :

{T5C070}
[Kid]
...I know.


76 :

{T5C071}
[Kid]
I know that, Takeshi... I know...


{T5C072}
[Kid]
But still.


77 :

{T5C073}
[Kid]
Even though I know that, what can I do!?


78 :

{T5C074}
[Y¤u]
Ahh...!


79 :
Just then, the Kid knocked the sandwich out of
Y¤u's hand.

She hadn't even taken a bite out of her
'Tanaka Special'...


80 :
It fell into the water with a splash and sank
slowly.


{T5C075}
[Y¤u]
...!


81 :
[Takeshi]
Bastard! What do you think you're doing!?

I went over, grabbed onto the Kid, and
raised my hand.

82 :
{11:0-d0}
{11:1}Hit the Kid

{11:1}Don't hit him


83 :
[Takeshi]
You better brace yourself...!


84 :

{T5C076}
[Kid]
!


85 :
‡LWhack!

I struck the Kid hard on his cheek.


86 :

{T5C077}
[Kid]
Agh...

[Takeshi]
.........

It hurt...

It had to have hurt him.

My hand even hurt.

But more than the pain in my hand, my heart hurt.

I let go of the Kid's collar, and he backed
away slowly.

Everyone watched us silently.


{T5C078}
[Kid]
You hit me...


{T5C079}
[Kid]
It hurts...


{T5C080}
[Kid]
Aaghh...


{T5C081}
[Kid]
Damn it, damn it...

Tears welled up in his eyes.


87 :
[Takeshi]
You...!


88 :

{T5C082}
[Kid]
!

Cowed, the Kid froze.


89 :
[Kid]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

I pulled back the hand that I had raised.

It all felt so stupid...

And so terribly sad.


90 :
The Kid looked up at me, all hunched up and
trembling.

I was disappointed in myself for having tried
to hit someone like him.

My heart ached with sadness.

I let go of the Kid's collar, and he backed
away slowly.

Everyone watched us silently.


{T5C083}
[Kid]
Aaghh...


{T5C084}
[Kid]
Damn it, damn it...

Tears welled up in his eyes.


91 :
[Takeshi]
Kid... look over at Tsugumi.

[Takeshi]
"She injured her leg terribly and almost 
drowned..."

[Takeshi]
"She had surgery... If it was me, I'd have 
probably died, but she pulled through it."

I pointed at Tsugumi.


92 :
Tsugumi stood silently.

The Kid timidly raised his eyes to look at her.


93 :
But he soon stared at the floor again.


94 :

{T5C085}
[Kid]
But...


{T5C086}
[Kid]
Takeshi, you can say that, but...


95 :

{T5C087}
[Kid]
I'm not Tsugumi...


{T5C088}
[Kid]
We're not all the same.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


96 :

{T5C089}
[Kid]
I can't do it.


{T5C090}
[Kid]
I can't do it...


97 :

{T5C091}
[Kid]
I'm just not that strong.


{T5C092}
[Kid]
And I never will be...!


98 :

{T5C093}
[Kid]
I can't go on living.


{T5C094}
[Kid]
I don't want to go on living...!


99 :

{T5C095}
[Kid]
So then...


{T5C096}
[Kid]
I should just...

[Takeshi]
.........

I didn't want to make him say the rest.

But I couldn't stop him.

I knew how hard it would be for him to say.


Even I wasn't that strong.

Everyone waited for the Kid's next words in
silence...

They were probably unthinkable.


100 :

{T5C097}
[Tsugumi]
So what do you want to do?

[Takeshi]
!?


{T5C098}
[Y¤u]
!


{T5C099}
[Sora]
?


{T5C100}
[£o¢o]
...!?


{T5C101}
[Kid]
...What!?


101 :

{T5C102}
[Tsugumi]
What do you want to do... Kid?

Tsugumi took a step forward and stared at the
Kid.

Those eyes were unfeeling and quiet.


{T5C103}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, you can tell me.


{T5C104}
[Tsugumi]
I want to know what you want to do...


102 :
Softly, she approached the Kid one step at a
time.

Everyone was so caught off guard that they
couldn't move. Couldn't say a word.


103 :
[Kid]
.........


{T5C105}
[Tsugumi]
What? You can't say it?


{T5C106}
[Kid]
.........

He tried to say something, but no words would
come out of his mouth.

He had also forgotten how to back away.


104 :
Tsugumi went up to the Kid and touched him.


105 :

{T5C107}
[Tsugumi]
You don't want to live?


{T5C108}
[Kid]
...Ugh...

The Kid tried to nod, but his head wouldn't
budge.


106 :

{T5C109}
[Tsugumi]
So, you want to die then?


{T5C110}
[Kid]
...Uuugh...

The Kid couldn't respond either.


107 :

{T5C111}
[Tsugumi]
Say something, please...


{T5C112}
[Tsugumi]
I don't know what you mean...


108 :
[Kid]
.........

Tsugumi asked the Kid, her tone neutral.


109 :

{T5C113}
[Tsugumi]
So which is it...?


{T5C114}
[Tsugumi]
Do you want to die?


{T5C115}
[Tsugumi]
Do you want to live?


110 :

{T5C116}
[Kid]
...Aaggh...


111 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


{T5C117}
[Tsugumi]
So... you can't answer?


{T5C118}
[Tsugumi]
Well then...


{T5C119}
[Tsugumi]
Don't ever... say that again.


112 :

{T5C120}
[Tsugumi]
Okay?


113 :

{T5C121}
[Kid]
Ah...!


114 :
The Kid broke down in tears and fell to the
submerged floor.


{T5C122}
[Kid]
Aaaagh...


{T5C123}
[Kid]
I'm sorry...


{T5C124}
[Kid]
I'm so... sorryyy...


115 :
Y¤u, suddenly spurred into action, ran over
to the Kid and wrapped her arms around his
shoulders.


116 :
Sora looked down and covered her face with
her hands. She was trembling.

£o¢o and Pipi were staring at everyone,
speechless.


117 :
[Takeshi]
Tsu-Tsugumi...!?

Not knowing what else to say, I just stood
there.

I looked at her face.


118 :
But I couldn't read what she was thinking
from her expression.


119 :

{T5C125}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


120 :

{T5C126}
[Tsugumi]
Come here for a second...

[Takeshi]
?


121 :
Seeing that I was confused, Tsugumi ran over
to me.


122 :
Eyebrows raised, she glared at me strongly.


What was she thinking...?


123 :
[Takeshi]
Ouch!

[Takeshi]
Wh-wh-wh-what are you doing...!? That hurts!


124 :

{T5C127}
[Tsugumi]
Stop whining and get over here!


{T5C128}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, hurry up!


125 :
Totally clueless, I followed along behind her.

She had grabbed my ear and mercilessly
tugged...


126 :
[Takeshi]
L-let me go! Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
Why are you doing this!? Ouch...


127 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

She wordlessly and doggedly moved forward.

She kept a firm grip on me and kept pulling
so that I couldn't get away.


128 :
[Takeshi]
"You'll rip my ear off! It's seriously going 
to come off!"

[Takeshi]
Aaaaaagh, officer...

[Takeshi]
"This is killing meeee. Let go of me. 
Pleeease..."

[Tsugumi]
..........

We kept climbing the stairs.

She wouldn't let go no matter how I pleaded,
so I finally shut up.


129 :
And when we finally made it to the second floor,
she let go of my ear.

[Takeshi]
Wheeeew... Thank heavens...

[Takeshi]
"I mean... What are you doing!? Are you 
crazy!?"


130 :

{T5C129}
[Tsugumi]
Quit your bitching...


{T5C130}
[Tsugumi]
Just when I thought you'd FINALLY shut up...

Tsugumi let out a big sigh.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what's that face supposed to mean!?


131 :

{T5C131}
[Tsugumi]
Just what it looks like...


{T5C132}
[Tsugumi]
I'm so disappointed in you.

She furrowed her brow and looked at me.

She pinched the bridge of her nose and shook
her head.

She looked completely fed up.


132 :
Tsugumi turned, and she started walking away
from me.

[Takeshi]
H-hey! Wait a second!


133 :
[Takeshi]
Why?

[Takeshi]
What's with you!? Did I do something to you?

I hurried over to her and insisted that she
answer me.


134 :

{T5C133}
[Tsugumi]
No...


135 :

{T5C134}
[Tsugumi]
"No, it's not like that... You don't understand 
anything."


136 :
And throwing back her shoulders, she picked
up her pace.

[Takeshi]
What don't I understand?

[Takeshi]
I mean... er...

[Takeshi]
"Things were getting out of hand back 
there... If you hadn't said something, I don't 
know how it would have turned out."

[Takeshi]
"I'm glad you did. I'm... really sorry. And 
thanks..."


137 :
[Tsugumi]
.........


138 :
[Takeshi]
Hey, wait! Tsugumi...!

I kept yelling as I chased after her.

[Takeshi]
"You of all people know how serious this 
situation is, right? So how come you're..."

[Takeshi]
No, that's not it...

[Takeshi]
That's not it... That's not it!

[Takeshi]
You're angry at ME, right?

[Takeshi]
Why are you so mad...? Please tell me!


139 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

Tsugumi stopped at the entrance to Qualle.


{T5C135}
[Tsugumi]
Okay, I will...


140 :

{T5C136}
[Tsugumi]
"It's a stupid question, but I'll answer it 
for you anyway."

[Takeshi]
O-okay...


141 :
All of a sudden, Tsugumi smiled at me.

I flinched.


{T5C137}
[Tsugumi]
Do you remember what you said earlier?

[Takeshi]
Me? I... Let's see...

[Takeshi]
"...I was fairly angry... so I really don't 
remember that well..."

[Takeshi]
"And might not have been all 'there' at the 
time..."

[Takeshi]
B-but you know!

[Takeshi]
"I really don't think I said anything wrong 
to the Kid!"

[Takeshi]
And I'm sure about that...


142 :

{T5C138}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah...


143 :

{T5C139}
[Tsugumi]
I guess it looks like you weren't wrong.


144 :

{T5C140}
[Tsugumi]
That's why...


145 :

{T5C141}
[Tsugumi]
That's why I'm mad.


146 :
Tsugumi jumped onto the Jellyfish Gondola.


147 :
I got on soon after her and closed the door.

The gondola zipped into the tube and out
into the ocean.


148 :

{T5C142}
[Tsugumi]
I get so frustrated!


149 :
Bam!

Tsugumi pounded the shell of the jellyfish
with her fist.

Her expression was one of annoyance again.

The gondola swayed slightly as it moved
slowly forward.


150 :

{T5C143}
[Tsugumi]
Is it really just 'enough to be alive'?


{T5C144}
[Tsugumi]
"You say, 'You're one of us, so you should 
cooperate'?"


{T5C145}
[Tsugumi]
"And that's how you keep pushing him to agree 
with you and buy into all your fake ideals."


{T5C146}
[Tsugumi]
"I can't believe how irresponsible you can 
be..."


{T5C147}
[Tsugumi]
Who the hell do you think you are?


{T5C148}
[Tsugumi]
"You've really got some nerve talking like 
that..."

[Takeshi]
So!? What else could I do!?

[Takeshi]
"It's better than just standing by and 
watching him sink in despair. It's better to 
have a little hope than nothing at all, right?"


{T5C149}
[Tsugumi]
You're such a hypocrite.

[Takeshi]
"Well, you know what? You're selfish and 
self-righteous... and you're always talking 
like you don't care about anyone!"

[Takeshi]
"You go around hurting people on purpose and 
making them feel like crap..."

[Takeshi]
And now you're trying to make me look bad...!


{T5C150}
[Tsugumi]
I don't... I'm not doing it on purpose.


{T5C151}
[Tsugumi]
There's just a lot that I don't agree with.

[Takeshi]
Liar.

[Takeshi]
"That's not the way you want things to happen 
in your heart, and you know that!"

[Takeshi]
Why do you have to lash out at everything!?

[Takeshi]
Why can't you just be yourself for once?


{T5C152}
[Tsugumi]
"You're wrong... You're the one who isn't being 
yourself!"

[Takeshi]
I'm always myself.


{T5C153}
[Tsugumi]
You're so twisted.

[Takeshi]
That's funny coming from you.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"This isn't what we were talking about 
anyway."

[Takeshi]
Why are you so angry?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"If I did something wrong, then I guess I 
deserve it..."

[Takeshi]
"If there really is a good reason, then hey, I 
won't complain."

[Takeshi]
So come on, tell me.

[Takeshi]
"I won't argue with you, just tell me what it 
is."

[Tsugumi]
.........


151 :

{T5C154}
[Tsugumi]
You really want to know...?

Tsugumi sat back down in the gondola.

Her tone had almost returned to normal.

[Takeshi]
Y-yeah. Of course.

She hesitated a bit, but soon came to sit
next to me.

Tsugumi looked straight ahead.

She didn't try to look at me.


{T5C155}
[Tsugumi]
Why?

[Takeshi]
Because... I want to know.

[Takeshi]
"Because I want to know what my friends are 
thinking."

I put my hand lightly on her shoulder.

I was becoming more and more worried.

Maybe she was still trying to be stubborn...


Tsugumi didn't try to shake off my hand, but
just sat there.


{T5C156}
[Tsugumi]
Well...


{T5C157}
[Tsugumi]
"You had made me 'one of the gang', hadn't 
you...?"

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C158}
[Tsugumi]
If you want to know, then here goes.


{T5C159}
[Tsugumi]
"I'll tell you... It's because, in the end, 
I've become 'your friend'."

[Takeshi]
...I see.

[Takeshi]
"Why do you have to say it like that!? You're 
not still..."

Tsugumi thrust her hand into her pocket and
took something out.


152 :

{T5C160}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, you know what this is, right?

[Takeshi]
Chami.

[Takeshi]
Djungarian hamster...

[Takeshi]
"Who cares, where the heck did you pull him 
from?"


{T5C161}
[Tsugumi]
My pocket...

[Takeshi]
I know that. That's not what I'm asking...

[Takeshi]
"Don't just shove him out and talk about him 
as a 'this'."

[Takeshi]
"Hamsters are delicate living creatures, and 
you should be careful with him."


{T5C162}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah, you're right...


{T5C163}
[Tsugumi]
But what else can I do?


{T5C164}
[Tsugumi]
He doesn't have anywhere else to go.

[Takeshi]
.........

Chami stood in Tsugumi's hand.

He twitched his nose and looked up at both of
our faces inquisitively.

Tsugumi stroked Chami softly with the tip of
her finger.


153 :

{T5C165}
[Tsugumi]
"Heeey Takeshi, do you know what will happen 
if I go like THIS?"

[Takeshi]
!?

Tsugumi...

Grasped both of her hands tightly together.

In between the cracks of her fingers, I could
see Chami's soft, warm-looking, gray fur.

His body disappeared entirely in her hands.



{T5C166}
[Tsugumi]
Do you know what will happen?

[Takeshi]
I-idiot! Cut it out!


{T5C167}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, answer me...

Tsugumi started to squeeze harder.

Chami, who had only the tip of his nose
visible, turned his beady eyes toward Tsugumi.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what are you talking about!?

[Takeshi]
It's totally obvious! What a stupid question!

[Takeshi]
"You want to talk about stupid questions? 
There's one for you!"

She started squeezing more.

The space between her fingers got smaller and
smaller.

Chami twisted his body and started to struggle.

[Takeshi]
"Cut it out! Tsugumi, if you go on like 
this... Chami's going to..."

The hamster looked at Tsugumi and me.

At the end, I thought he even let out a small
breath.


154 :
Squish.

155 :



156 :
Tsugumi crushed her hands together with all
of her might.

They pressed together.

Her hands were shaking with the effort.

From the cracks of her fingers, red droplets
started to fall.


{T5C168}
[Tsugumi]
Well, Takeshi...


{T5C169}
[Tsugumi]
What do you think happened... to Chami?

[Takeshi]
.........

Tsugumi's voice was also shaking.


{T5C170}
[Tsugumi]
Tell me...


{T5C171}
[Tsugumi]
TELL ME!

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
No.

[Takeshi]
You think I'm going to answer that?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Open your hands.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi... open up your hands!

[Takeshi]
Please, just open them up...

[Takeshi]
Now!

[Tsugumi]
.........

Her hands were shaking heavily as they opened.


157 :
[Takeshi]
Chami...

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi... what have you done...!

He was dead.

And his fur was slightly wet.

Chami looked like a dirty old dishrag.

It was likely that all of the bones in his body
were broken.

All of the blood had probably been squeezed
from his body.

He doubtlessly hadn't had any time to wonder, it
had happened so fast...

His life had been... extinguished...


{T5C172}
[Tsugumi]
So...


{T5C173}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, do you know...?


{T5C174}
[Tsugumi]
What do you think... is going to happen now?

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!

[Takeshi]
Cut it out!

I shook Tsugumi's shoulders violently.

I thought for sure that I would knock her down.

I forced her to look at me.

But...

Tsugumi...

Was crying, and her lips trembled as she bit
down on them.


{T5C175}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


{T5C176}
[Tsugumi]
Why won't you answer me...?


{T5C177}
[Tsugumi]
Aaaahh...

[Takeshi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Chami is...

[Takeshi]
Chami is...


158 :
[Takeshi]
Dead.

[Takeshi]
He won't ever move again.

[Takeshi]
.........


159 :
[Takeshi]
!?

In her hand, Chami seemed to move faintly.

As if he had woken up suddenly.

His movements were stiff, barely visible,
and...

Extremely slow, but...

He was actually moving.

His heart had started beating again, he had
started thinking again, breathing again.

He shook himself off slightly...

Fluttered his ears...

And twitched his nose.

He got up on shaking legs and even tried to
stand.

However...

There was still blood on her hand.


160 :

{T5C178}
[Tsugumi]
So, Takeshi...


{T5C179}
[Tsugumi]
What happened to Chami?

[Takeshi]
.........

Our gondola at Qualle had already passed the
entrance to the ride twice and was just
starting to make its third pass.

One pass really wasn't that long.

Altogether, we had only been on it for
just over ten minutes.

In that brief time, he had returned to normal
and was sitting up on her palm... staring at
the two of us inquisitively.


161 :

{T5C180}
[Tsugumi]
He's...

Tsugumi was petting Chami softly again with
the tip of her finger.


{T5C181}
[Tsugumi]
Different than the Kid.


{T5C182}
[Tsugumi]
Different than you.


{T5C183}
[Tsugumi]
You saw, didn't you?


{T5C184}
[Tsugumi]
That was real.


{T5C185}
[Tsugumi]
Chami has the virus.


162 :

{T5C186}
[Tsugumi]
"The first time I tried to pet him, he got 
spooked."


{T5C187}
[Tsugumi]
"He bit my finger, and my blood got all over 
him..."


{T5C188}
[Tsugumi]
So Chami's just like me now.


163 :
[Takeshi]
No...

[Takeshi]
No way...

[Takeshi]
No way... I don't believe you...

I still couldn't believe her.

Or what she had told me about the virus
earlier.

Or what had happened right in front of me
then.


164 :

{T5C189}
[Tsugumi]
See... this little guy's alive.

Tsugumi murmured as she looked down.


{T5C190}
[Tsugumi]
He's alive...


{T5C191}
[Tsugumi]
He's breathing. His heart is beating...


{T5C192}
[Tsugumi]
"But it hurt, didn't it, little guy? It was 
painful, wasn't it...?"


{T5C193}
[Tsugumi]
I did something terrible...


{T5C194}
[Tsugumi]
I'm sorry, Chami. I'm so sorry...


{T5C195}
[Tsugumi]
Forgive me... I was wrong...


{T5C196}
[Tsugumi]
"But it's okay, because... you're alive, 
right...?"

[Takeshi]
!

I started shaking Tsugumi's shoulders again.

[Takeshi]
Wh-what the hell are you talking about!?

[Takeshi]
H-how can you say something like that!?

[Takeshi]
"You just put him through something 
unimaginable and now you just say 'it's okay 
because you're alive'!"


165 :

{T5C197}
[Tsugumi]
No!

Tsugumi brushed my hands off.


{T5C198}
[Tsugumi]
That's what YOU said!


{T5C199}
[Tsugumi]
That's exactly what you said back there!


{T5C200}
[Tsugumi]
"It's 'enough to be alive'‡Lyou're the one 
who said that!"


{T5C201}
[Tsugumi]
"So how about it!? You saw what happened, 
right!?"


{T5C202}
[Tsugumi]
"You saw what happened to Chami, right? What 
I did to him...? You SAW it, Takeshi!"


{T5C203}
[Tsugumi]
"And you can say it's 'enough to still be 
alive'...? Well, it isn't."


{T5C204}
[Tsugumi]
It isn't. No matter what you say...!


{T5C205}
[Tsugumi]
I won't believe it!


{T5C206}
[Tsugumi]
"It isn't enough to just have life... You 
can't say that's living!"

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C207}
[Tsugumi]
So... do you understand?


{T5C208}
[Tsugumi]
...Or don't you?


{T5C209}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, tell me...?


{T5C210}
[Tsugumi]
How about you, Chami...


{T5C211}
[Tsugumi]
Do you understand...?

[Takeshi]
.........

Her face was pointing down.

I couldn't see her expression...

But I didn't have to. I knew what it was...

Tsugumi was crying silently.

Countless tears fell from her face.

Like raindrops falling one by one onto the
red-stained floor of Qualle.


166 :
[Takeshi]
.........

I didn't know what to say.

No words seemed adequate.


{T5C212}
[Tsugumi]
Hey...


{T5C213}
[Tsugumi]
Do you know... how many times I've died?

She was trying to stay as calm as she could.

[Takeshi]
I have no idea...

I scarcely could move my lips as I replied.


{T5C214}
[Tsugumi]
I don't remember anymore anyway.

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C215}
[Tsugumi]
"In the beginning, there were said to be only 
a few of us carriers."


{T5C216}
[Tsugumi]
But out of all of them, I was special...

.........

......


167 :

{T5C217}
[Tsugumi]
August, 2005.


{T5C218}
[Tsugumi]
"I was twelve at the time, and my family went to 
America because of my father's job."


{T5C219}
[Tsugumi]
A friend of mine then...


{T5C220}
[Tsugumi]
Julia...


{T5C221}
[Tsugumi]
"She and I were the same age, and she had to 
go to the hospital."


{T5C222}
[Tsugumi]
They said it was a terminal disease...


{T5C223}
[Tsugumi]
"She had leukemia... and was transferred 
back and forth to different places, but 
nobody could help her..."


{T5C224}
[Tsugumi]
"But I kept going to see her. To keep up her 
spirits."


{T5C225}
[Tsugumi]
"Watching her smiling face, I couldn't 
believe that she didn't have long to live."


{T5C226}
[Tsugumi]
I thought there would be a miracle...


{T5C227}
[Tsugumi]
"I thought if I prayed enough, she'd get 
better..."


{T5C228}
[Tsugumi]
"If I cared enough, her pain and suffering 
would be less."


{T5C229}
[Tsugumi]
I believed that...


{T5C230}
[Tsugumi]
Then one day...


{T5C231}
[Tsugumi]
I got in an accident.

[Takeshi]
...An accident?

[Takeshi]
Is that how you got the virus...?


{T5C232}
[Tsugumi]
No...


168 :

{T5C233}
[Tsugumi]
"Right after I left the hospital, I got hit 
by a semi-trailer."


{T5C234}
[Tsugumi]
"Broken bones throughout my body, torn muscles 
everywhere. I went into a coma. I even stopped 
breathing."


{T5C235}
[Tsugumi]
It was hopeless.


{T5C236}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{T5C237}
[Tsugumi]
For some reason, I didn't die.


{T5C238}
[Tsugumi]
And a few months later...


{T5C239}
[Tsugumi]
I woke up in an unfamiliar place.


169 :
Where am I?

It's a hospital.

Which one...?

Well... I don't really know either.

You don't know?

Hahaha... I don't know why, but I don't
know.

My name's... Tsugumi. Komachi Tsugumi. You?

Huh?

What is your name?

...Well, I don't know that either. Sucks, huh?


170 :

{T5C240}
[Tsugumi]
I woke up next to a boy with amnesia.


{T5C241}
[Tsugumi]
Outside the window was unfamiliar scenery...


{T5C242}
[Tsugumi]
"I was pretty sure it was somewhere in 
America."


{T5C243}
[Tsugumi]
But in order to find out just where I was...


{T5C244}
[Tsugumi]
It would take another eight years.

[Takeshi]
Eight years?


{T5C245}
[Tsugumi]
I was there the whole time...


{T5C246}
[Tsugumi]
I was at that 'hospital'...


171 :
Who are you?

I'm the physician who will be attending to
you.

Physician? Oh, you mean you're a doctor.

Yes. I'm going to find a cure for your
sickness and make you all better.

Cure me...? I got in an accident and got
hurt...

No. It's a little different than that.

...Different?

You have a new disease. One that we've never
seen before.


172 :
[Takeshi]
A new kind of disease?

[Takeshi]
So that was...?


{T5C247}
[Tsugumi]
Yes.


{T5C248}
[Tsugumi]
I don't know how I got it or when.


{T5C249}
[Tsugumi]
"But by the time I woke up... No, probably 
before I got in the accident."


{T5C250}
[Tsugumi]
"I was already in the process of becoming 
'immortal'."


173 :
Alright, I'd like to take a little of your
blood.

Why?

Well, it's for research. To find a way to
cure you, of course.

Research?

Your illness is very rare.

Rare?

There are very few people in the world who
have it, and of all those people, you're special.

Special?

Your genetic code is being rewritten. It is
truly fascinating. You are the talk of our
whole medical center.

I don't understand... what you're talking
about...

Hey, don't worry about it. We're going to
find a way to make you better, I promise.

Um? How are you going to get some blood?

Weeell, princess... We just... Hey, don't you
worry yourself about it.

.........

Just give me your arm and we'll be done
before you know it. It won't hurt.


174 :

{T5C251}
[Tsugumi]
"They came to take blood samples again and 
again."


{T5C252}
[Tsugumi]
"I didn't think much about it at the time. 
Why they would do that..."


{T5C253}
[Tsugumi]
"The doctors kept telling me, 'It's so we can 
find a cure for you', 'It's so we can help 
you, and people like you'."

[Takeshi]
.........


175 :
Hey, you there next to me...

What?

You're sick too, aren't you?

Me? Uh, well, I...

The same sickness as me?

No. Ummm... I mean, probably not.

You mean... you aren't sure?

Yeah, I'm fine. I know. I can...

Um, you can?

I can see the future.


176 :

{T5C254}
[Tsugumi]
This is what he told me.


{T5C255}
[Tsugumi]
"'You are going to have many tragedies in your 
life.'"


{T5C256}
[Tsugumi]
'But I don't want you to be sad.'


{T5C257}
[Tsugumi]
"'The first one in five years, then three 
years later, then in another three years...'"


177 :

{T5C258}
[Tsugumi]
"'But you're going to... live through all of 
them.'"


{T5C259}
[Tsugumi]
That's pretty much what he told me.


{T5C260}
[Tsugumi]
"It didn't take long for me to understand 
what he was saying, even at my young age."

[Takeshi]
.........


178 :
Tsugumi, take a look, there's a cat and mouse
over there.

Oh yeah. They're so cute...

I wonder why they're in a place like this?

Yeah... Those cages are so small, it looks
painful...

You want to let them out?

I wonder if it'd be alright...?

It should be. Come on, let's do it!

Hey, wait...


179 :
Okay, everyone out! Run while you can!


180 :
Crash!

...Hey! What do you think you two are doing!?


181 :
Oh no! The experiment!

Everyone, be careful! Whatever you do, don't
let them bite you!

Watch out, they're contagious!


182 :
.........


183 :
They were really mad at us.

You opened up those cages so fast, you
surprised me.

They caught all of the animals again.

Yeah, they're right back where they were
before.

In those cramped, small cages...

They're trapped again...

Why do they have to be locked up that way?

Why...?

I wonder...

Why?


184 :

{T5C261}
[Tsugumi]
I slowly started to realize why.


{T5C262}
[Tsugumi]
"I began to understand bit by bit that I 
wasn't being kept at a hospital, but a 
research facility."


{T5C263}
[Tsugumi]
Nobody came to see me...


{T5C264}
[Tsugumi]
And none of the 'patients' ever left...


{T5C265}
[Tsugumi]
"And there were hardly ever any new 
patients..."


{T5C266}
[Tsugumi]
And the whole time, I never knew where I was.


185 :
Huh? They're all gone.

.........

You didn't let them out again, did you?

...No.

Oh. Well, I wonder where they went then.

...I don't know...

Hmmm. But they shouldn't have been kept in
such a cramped space anyway.

...Yeah...

Maybe the researchers thought the same thing
and let them go?

...No idea...


186 :
It's no good. We still haven't been able to
discover the reason or mechanism behind it.

It happened right in front of me, but I still
can't believe it.

The only explanation I can come up with is
genetic transfer... It goes against
everything we know about science.

They withstood up to four splicings. I think
maybe they could take eight...

Let's keep testing.

No, if we continue...

There is no mistaking it, they're still alive.
They might still even react at sixteen...

But they're not...!

These aren't living creatures anymore... Is
that what you want to say?

.........

Perhaps... that way of thinking might have been
correct according to our old understanding.
But we have no idea of the possibilities
this entails.

That's... That's not right... It's crazy.


187 :
.........


188 :
Ah! The mice are still there! They're so cute.

........

Wait, something's strange. One, two, three...

........

Huh? Are there more of them? Or less?

........

Did they put the cats back in their cages?

.........

The cover is locked... Umph... I can't get
it off.

.........

Huh? What?

.........

Hey, kid...? Where did the kid go?

.........

Answer me.

.........


189 :
Get out of here. It's time for you to leave.


190 :

{T5C267}
[Tsugumi]
"That's what it was like for eight years, day 
in and day out."


{T5C268}
[Tsugumi]
Every single day...


{T5C269}
[Tsugumi]
The researcher called for me.


{T5C270}
[Tsugumi]
Telling me, 'I'm your friend.'


{T5C271}
[Tsugumi]
But the truth is that he wasn't.


{T5C272}
[Tsugumi]
"I was being forced to do all of these tests 
and experiments."


{T5C273}
[Tsugumi]
And they just used me like some tool.


{T5C274}
[Tsugumi]
"I stopped being able to feel pain or to 
suffer."


{T5C275}
[Tsugumi]
"When I went back to bed, all I could do was 
cry."


{T5C276}
[Tsugumi]
"One day, the kid next to me didn't come 
back."

[Tsugumi]
.........


{T5C277}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... do you know why?

[Takeshi]
...Yeah...

[Takeshi]
I mean, no, I don't know, but...


{T5C278}
[Tsugumi]
So I don't have to explain it to you...?

[Takeshi]
Yeah...

[Takeshi]
"If it's too painful for you... you don't have 
to say anything more."

Tsugumi was stroking Chami with a trembling
finger.

I put my hand lightly on Tsugumi's shoulder.

To suddenly get hit by a virulent disease...

And become someone who would never age...

Spend eight years trapped in a research
facility...

I couldn't imagine how it must have been to go
through that.


{T5C279}
[Tsugumi]
I hate it...


{T5C280}
[Tsugumi]
And I hate myself for talking about it...


{T5C281}
[Tsugumi]
It's funny, isn't it...


{T5C282}
[Tsugumi]
"Whenever I'm with you, I find myself talking 
about the stupidest things..."

[Takeshi]
It's okay, you don't have to talk.

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
I'm so sorry...

[Takeshi]
"It was totally irresponsible, what I said back 
there."

[Takeshi]
"It was careless of me to talk about being 
alive like it's just a given."


{T5C283}
[Tsugumi]
I don't want your pity.


{T5C284}
[Tsugumi]
It's too late...

[Takeshi]
It isn't like that. It's not like that!

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi...

[Takeshi]
I was wrong, okay?


191 :

{T5C285}
[Tsugumi]
You were wrong!?

She screamed suddenly.


{T5C286}
[Tsugumi]
Don't tell me that!


{T5C287}
[Tsugumi]
"You don't just take back what you say. Not 
that easily...!"


{T5C288}
[Tsugumi]
"You want irresponsible, THAT's 
irresponsible...!"

[Takeshi]
...!

I didn't know what to tell her.


{T5C289}
[Tsugumi]
You're just like them.


{T5C290}
[Tsugumi]
You don't understand anything...


{T5C291}
[Tsugumi]
"You throw around words like 'friend' without 
really meaning it."


{T5C292}
[Tsugumi]
"You don't understand anything about how I'm 
feeling."


{T5C293}
[Tsugumi]
"You don't understand anything about what the 
Kid's feeling!"

[Takeshi]
.........

She was making me feel it had been a mistake
to say I'd been wrong.

No... that wasn't it either.

The truth was...

There was no such thing as right and wrong.


{T5C294}
[Tsugumi]
"'People who are alive should live as long 
as they can'... You said that, didn't you...?"


{T5C295}
[Tsugumi]
I'll survive.


{T5C296}
[Tsugumi]
"I'll probably die many times more and I'll 
still be alive."


{T5C297}
[Tsugumi]
Chami here too...


{T5C298}
[Tsugumi]
"But, Takeshi, can you say that you're really 
alive right now?"


{T5C299}
[Tsugumi]
Are you REALLY there in front of me now?

[Takeshi]
.........


{T5C300}
[Tsugumi]
...What's wrong?


{T5C301}
[Tsugumi]
"You said... you'd accept everything I had to 
say, right...?"


{T5C302}
[Tsugumi]
You said that... Right, Takeshi?

She bit her lip.

Her shoulders were shaking.

She looked bitterly disappointed.

It was frustrating.

That when she tried to live, she ended up
dying.

And when she tried to die, she ended up living.

It was a process that repeated itself over
and over without end.

It wasn't right or wrong, it was her reality.

And it was something that she had no choice
but to accept.

But I still wasn't able to accept it.


{T5C303}
[Tsugumi]
So stupid...


{T5C304}
[Tsugumi]
I'm stupid...


{T5C305}
[Tsugumi]
"Uumm... But you know what? You're way 
stupider than me..."


192 :
The gondola swayed.

We had arrived at the end of the ride.

I had no idea how many times we'd passed by
Qualle.


193 :
The door opened suddenly.

She got up quickly and opened the door.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!


194 :
I stuck out my hand to grab her, but she
swatted it away immediately.


{T5C306}
[Tsugumi]
Don't touch me!


{T5C307}
[Tsugumi]
Don't... touch me...


195 :
Slam!

She closed the door from outside.

The jellyfish I was riding on started moving
again.


196 :
[Takeshi]
Stupid...

I muttered to myself.

[Takeshi]
Stupid idiot...

I said it myself.

I said it to her.

I said it to no one and nothing in particular.

To everything...

Outside the window was the ocean.

An ocean closed off from the light.

When it passed under the shadow of the
installation, the gondola became dark.


197 :
And inside of the darkness...

All alone in the darkness...

I bit down hard on my lip as I cried.


198 :
Soon after, it was night.

In the conference room, Y¤u, £o¢o, and Pipi
were waiting.

Even the Kid...

It looked like the Kid had calmed down some.

While I'd been gone, it seemed that Y¤u and
£o¢o had been able to talk some sense into him.

Y¤u told me that he'd probably been upset by a
reoccurring memory and had gotten worked up
in spite of himself.

I felt that I'd gotten out of hand and had
said some terrible things myself.

I went around to everyone there and apologized.

Soon afterward...

A report came to us in the conference room,
directly from LeMMIH's terminal.

Y¤u read out the contents to all of us.


199 :
Third floor: Dritter Stock partition schematic‡L

The 'Cosmic Whale' room had flooded
completely.


200 :
Casualties: None.

Flooding to other rooms: None.

Chance of damage spreading: None...

Shivering slightly in the cold, I wrapped my
arms around my knees, and we all went to sleep.
