1 :
I waited for the rest of the explanation.

But Sora didn't say anything more.

...I guessed she was trying to say, 'Figure the
rest out yourself.'

I thought...


2 :
LeMU was controlled by a Japanese-German joint
venture called Leiblich Pharmaceuticals...


There had to be a reason that a pharmaceutical
company would build a theme park in such a
place...

That reason and in-house power generation...
What could they have to do with each other...?

Power generation‡Lthermal seafloor vents‡Lthe
first thing that popped into my head was...

3 :
{11:0-0f}
{11:1}Hot springs

{11:1}Microorganisms


4 :
Hot springs.

Hot springs?

It seemed to me that a pharmaceutical company
and hot springs... would be totally unrelated...

No matter how much I thought about it,
I couldn't find a connection.


5 :
I decided to go ask Sora.

[Kid]
"Hey, does that have anything to do with what 
we were just talking about?"

Sora ignored my question and instead said...


6 :

{S1C190}
[Sora]
Do you mind if I get back to work?

It didn't look like the conversation would
lead anywhere.

So I gave up and went elsewhere.


7 :
Microorganisms.

That was it! Microorganisms!

There were unique kinds of microorganisms
found around thermal seafloor vents that
weren't found anywhere else.

That was why Leiblich Pharmaceuticals was
researching microorganisms on the seafloor...

'Himmel'‡L'IBF'‡L'High-pressure oxygen
treatment device'‡L

All those words that I had known flashed onto
the screen of my mind.

As usual, I had no idea why I knew them.

I had no idea about the reasons or causes
behind them, but I was convinced that
they were facts.


8 :
[Kid]
"On the ocean floor... below LeMU... Leiblich 
Pharmaceuticals has a research lab, right?"

I said that straight out to Sora.


9 :

{C1S283}
[Sora]
H-how do... you... know about that!?

[Kid]
I thought so...

[Kid]
"Leiblich made IBF on the seafloor to research 
germs and viruses."

[Kid]
The theme park was just a kind of cover...

[Kid]
"The researchers acted like staff members for 
LeMU, going above the ocean and back down to 
the seafloor."

[Kid]
"In that way, nobody would suspect that there 
was a lab here."

[Kid]
"Or it might have been a way of securing 
capital."

[Kid]
"Working in conjunction with a bustling 
amusement park... You would never be short 
of research funds."


10 :
[Kid]
I'm right, aren't I?


11 :

{C1S284}
[Sora]
Kid-san...


12 :

{C1S285}
[Sora]
Exactly... who are you?

[Kid]
I don't even know myself...

[Kid]
All I know is that I DO know these things...

[Kid]
It all comes to me through some sort of premonition.


13 :

{C1S286}
[Sora]
That... can't be.


{C1S287}
[Sora]
Are you lying to me?


14 :

{C1S288}
[Sora]
Are... Are you hiding something...?

[Kid]
I'm not hiding a thing.

[Kid]
"I'm being completely open about it... About 
everything I know... Everything..."

[Sora]
.........

[Kid]
.........


15 :

{C1S289}
[Sora]
I see.


{C1S290}
[Sora]
"Anyway, please forget about the 
conversation we just had."

[Kid]
I know. I won't tell anybody.


16 :

{C1S291}
[Sora]
That's not what I mean... I mean forget it.


{C1S292}
[Sora]
There is no research station on the seafloor.


{C1S293}
[Sora]
"There was in the past, but it has been 
closed."


17 :

{C1S294}
[Sora]
Please... just pretend that is the truth.

[Kid]
Okay. I understand.

[Kid]
"If it's that important to you... then I'll 
forget it."


18 :

{C1S295}
[Sora]
Do you promise?

I swore that I would, then left the control
room.
