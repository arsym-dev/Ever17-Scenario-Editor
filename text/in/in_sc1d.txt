1 :
In the darkness, a girl sat on a bed.


2 :
[Kid]
Uh, I... Um...

I was at a loss for words.

I didn't know where to start.

[Young Girl]
.........

The girl just stared at me intently.

[Kid]
It's... al-alright...

[Kid]
Don't worry... Everything is alright...

She didn't answer.

[Kid]
Uh... Um...

[Kid]
Anyway, let's go to where everybody else is!


{C1S296}
[Young Girl]
Everybody?

[Kid]
Yeah, it's not just me.

[Kid]
There are lots of other people...


{C1S297}
[Young Girl]
Help...? Did you come to help?

[Kid]
Y-yeah... That's right.


3 :

{C1S298}
[Young Girl]
But... it's probably impossible...

[Kid]
Huh?


{C1S299}
[Young Girl]
There is... no way out anymore...

The girl's eyes were sad and moist.


4 :
I decided to...

5 :
{11:0-11}
{11:1}Ask her why she said that

{11:1}Take the girl out of there


6 :
[Kid]
Why do you say that?

[Kid]
"We'll be fine! A rescue team should be here 
any time!"


7 :

{C1S300}
[Young Girl]
Liar...

[Kid]
It's not a lie!

[Kid]
"The people who escaped know that we're 
here..."

[Kid]
Someone will come for sure!

[Young Girl]
...

[Kid]
Why are you saying that's wrong?


{S1C237}
[Young Girl]
Because... Because...

8 :
Then, suddenly, a shocked look appeared on the
girl's face as her eyes focused behind me.

I followed her gaze.


9 :
On the other side of the door... was Takeshi,
peeking in.


10 :

{C1S302}
[Takeshi]
Who are you talking to?

[Kid]
Takeshi! What great timing...!

[Kid]
"It seems like this girl here didn't get out 
either..."


11 :

{C1S303}
[Takeshi]
Girl?


{C1S304}
[Takeshi]
What girl...?


12 :

{C1S305}
[Takeshi]
...There's nobody there.

[Kid]
Huh!?


13 :
I looked back.

The girl had vanished, and there was no sign
that anyone had been sitting where she had
been.

[Kid]
Im-impossible...


14 :

{C1S306}
[Takeshi]
"Stop it already. What? Are you tired of 
memory loss and working on hallucinations now?"


{C1S307}
[Takeshi]
You're worse off than we thought...

[Kid]
No! No! I'm not seeing things!

[Kid]
"There was a girl here! She was sitting on 
this bed!"


15 :

{C1S308}
[Takeshi]
Listen, Kid...

[Kid]
Wh-what...?


16 :

{C1S309}
[Takeshi]
Aren't you hungry?

[Kid]
Hungry...?

[Kid]
Wh-who cares about that right now?

[Kid]
There was a girl here... A girl, I tell you...


17 :

{C1S310}
[Takeshi]
I know, I know.


{C1S311}
[Takeshi]
There was a girl there. I heard you...

[Kid]
You don't get it at all!


{C1S312}
[Takeshi]
"Alright, alright. I'll listen to the whole 
story later."

[Kid]
But...


18 :

{C1S313}
[Takeshi]
"But nothing! You're going to piss me off 
if you keep this up!"


19 :

{C1S314}
[Takeshi]
"Everyone is waiting for you... to eat 
together..."

[Kid]
"Well, then, what are we going to do about 
the girl!?"

[Kid]
"I'm sure the girl is probably starving 
too..."


20 :

{C1S315}
[Takeshi]
Oh man... You've completely lost it...

[Kid]
I'm not crazy!

[Kid]
There was a girl... A girl... Right here...

In the end, I couldn't get Takeshi to listen
to me.


21 :
[Kid]
Let's go!

That was what I said.


22 :

{C1S316}
[Young Girl]
...Uh... Where?

[Kid]
Anywhere. Let's just get out of here.


{C1S317}
[Young Girl]
Why...?

[Kid]
"Because if we stay here, £o¢o, then we'll 
probably..."


23 :
I sucked in my breath.

Somehow, I knew her name as well.

'Yagami £o¢o'.

And then I had a premonition that something
was about to happen.

I thought that when I took my eyes off of
her... £o¢o would vanish...

Like a ghost...

So I would take her out of there...


{C1S318}
[£o¢o]
Don't go... Please...

[Kid]
Wh-what?


{C1S319}
[£o¢o]
Please, don't go...


{C1S320}
[£o¢o]
Don't leave me alone...

I couldn't understand what she meant.

I couldn't understand... but my mouth had an
answer.

[Kid]
I won't go.

[Kid]
I will stay with you, £o¢o.

'Please, don't go'... Just then, the two of our
minds had overlapped.

I didn't want to lose sight of £o¢o's existence.


And £o¢o felt the same way.

£o¢o's eyes watered as if she was sad.


24 :
Then a shocked look appeared on £o¢o's
face as her eyes focused behind me.

I followed £o¢o's gaze.


25 :
On the other side of the door... was Takeshi,
peeking in.


26 :

{C1S321}
[Takeshi]
Who are you talking to?


27 :
I hurriedly looked back.

But £o¢o was no longer there.

[Kid]
£o¢o! £o¢o!

My voice echoed and died in that small,
steel-plated room.

[Kid]
£o¢oooooo!

No one was there to answer my shouts.

There was no sign of anyone, and it felt as if
it might have been that way from the start.

There were no wrinkles where £o¢o had been
sitting. No warmth either.

There was just a faint smell.

Like the frozen smell that follows the north
wind across snowfields.


{C1S322}
[Takeshi]
£o-£o¢o...?


{C1S323}
[Takeshi]
Did... Did you just say... '£o¢o'?


28 :
I looked back at Takeshi.

Something was different about Takeshi.

His lips were trembling.

[Kid]
Takeshi... Do you know £o¢o?

[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
You do know her!


29 :

{C1S324}
[Takeshi]
No... I don't...

[Kid]
Liar!

[Kid]
The way you said that, I know you know her!


30 :

{C1S325}
[Takeshi]
Really... I don't...

[Kid]
Why are you lying?

[Kid]
The girl was here just now.

[Kid]
"But when you showed your face, she 
vanished..."


31 :

{C1S326}
[Takeshi]
You're the one who's lying.


{C1S327}
[Takeshi]
There's no girl in here...

[Kid]
"Yes, there was! I'm positive that £o¢o was 
sitting on that bed!"

[Takeshi]
............

[Kid]
Tell me! Who is she?


32 :

{C1S328}
[Takeshi]
I said I don't know anything about her...


33 :

{C1S329}
[Takeshi]
You're asking the wrong guy.


{C1S330}
[Takeshi]
I didn't see a thing.


{C1S331}
[Takeshi]
"You're the one who said you're seeing things, 
right?"


{C1S332}
[Takeshi]
I should be asking that question to you.


{C1S333}
[Takeshi]
Who is £o¢o? Some friend of yours?

[Kid]
No, but...


34 :

{C1S334}
[Takeshi]
So why do you know her name?

[Kid]
"I don't know why! It just suddenly popped 
into my head!"


35 :

{C1S335}
[Takeshi]
Not this crap again...


{C1S336}
[Takeshi]
You've got a pretty tricky case of amnesia...

[Kid]
............


36 :

{C1S337}
[Takeshi]
Okay, okay.


37 :

{C1S338}
[Takeshi]
"Let's say you happened to meet some girl in 
this compression chamber."


{C1S339}
[Takeshi]
"And you don't know why, but you knew her 
name."


{C1S340}
[Takeshi]
"And then, like some phantom, she just 
disappears without a trace."


38 :

{C1S341}
[Takeshi]
You're telling me to believe that?

[Kid]
I'm telling the truth!


{C1S342}
[Takeshi]
Sure you are.

[Kid]
It's true, I said!


39 :

{C1S343}
[Takeshi]
I know, I know.

[Kid]
You don't get it at all!


40 :

{C1S344}
[Takeshi]
Look, I'm getting outta here.


{C1S345}
[Takeshi]
You coming?

[Kid]
...Huh?


{C1S346}
[Takeshi]
"Everyone is waiting for you... we're going to 
eat together..."

[Kid]
Who cares about eating?


41 :

{C1S347}
[Takeshi]
Hmmph...


42 :

{C1S348}
[Takeshi]
Fine, do what you want.


43 :
Takeshi left me with those harsh words
and departed.


44 :
Before going to the conference room, I peeked
into the control room.

The bio scan figure was eating at my mind.


45 :
'Life readings: 5'

The number had dropped from six to five.


46 :
Everyone was in the conference room.

There were fried tuna sandwiches and drinks
secured from the sandwich shop for everyone.


Only Tsugumi was absent.

I wondered where she had gone... but more
than that, I was worried about her.

I told everyone about the girl.

But...

Everyone just laughed, and not one of them listened.

No one else had seen the girl.

Then I remembered the bio scan figure.


47 :
'7'

That girl was probably person number seven.

But the number had been five and six as well.


48 :
What could it mean?

The image of the girl had been burned into my
mind, and there was no getting away from it.

I wondered if it was, like Takeshi had
said, a hallucination.

If not, then... a ghost?


49 :
‡L'5, 6, 7'.

What could it mean?

If the girl was, in fact, a ghost, that would
mean that the number five was correct.

Sora wouldn't be included, and the four of us
there plus Tsugumi would equal five.

But the number had jumped to six and even to
seven.


50 :
What... in the world could that girl be...?

That reminded me of what Y¤u had said.


51 :

{C1S149}
[Y¤u]
"You think somebody would suddenly appear, 
disappear, or split into two people?"


52 :
If that were the case, it would explain
everything.

When the girl disappeared, the number would be
five, when she appeared, six, and when she
split, then seven.

‡LSplit?


53 :
Haha. That was crazy...

I shook my head at my own silliness.

Maybe I was losing it...

Something had to be wrong with me.

I needed to calm down and collect myself.

While I thought that, I flipped up the tab on
the can of cola.


54 :
Fushaaaww!

At first, I didn't know what had happened.

I licked the liquid around my lips.

It was sweet.

It seemed as if the cola had exploded
into my face.


55 :

{S1C252}
[Sara]
KYAHAHAHA~


{S1C253}
[Y¤u]
AHHAHAHA~


{S1C254}
[Sora]
FUFUFUFUFU~


{S1C255}
[Everyone]
GAHAHAHAHA~

Everyone exploded in a chorus of laughter.


56 :

{S1C256}
[Y¤u]
Hey, what the heck are you doing, Kid?

Y¤u said that, laughing.


{S1C257}
[Y¤u]
"These cans contain special gas so that they can 
be used at six atmospheres."


{S1C258}
[Y¤u]
But right now, we're at one atmosphere, right?


{S1C259}
[Y¤u]
"So if you don't hold it down when you open 
it, the soda inside explodes..."


57 :
As she laughed, Sara took out a handkerchief.

I took it and wiped my face.

I was enveloped in laughter...

Without noticing, I'd forgotten about
everything that had been weighing on my mind.
