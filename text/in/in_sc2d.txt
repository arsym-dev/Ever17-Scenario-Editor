{C2S218}
[Sora]
Someone has to 'see' me.


{C2S219}
[Sora]
I have to be seen in order to exist.


{C2S220}
[Sora]
Vision‡La viewpoint.


{C2S221}
[Sora]
Someone's perspective actually creates me.


{C2S222}
[Sora]
Kid-san...


{C2S223}
[Sora]
When you close your eyes, I disappear.

2 :
{11:0-18}
{11:1}Try it

{11:1}Don't do anything


3 :
[Kid]
...

I didn't say or do anything.

No, it would be better to say that I couldn't
say or do anything.


4 :
Eventually, we reached the conference room.

Sora's face was one big smile.

But somewhere in her smile seemed a hint of
sadness.

At least... it appeared that way to me.


5 :
[Kid]
When I close my eyes...?

I decided to test it and covered my eyes with
one hand.


6 :
Instantly, Sora vanished.

If Sora did exist, I should have been able to
see her head above my hand and her feet below.

But Sora wasn't there.

My hand kept the laser from reaching my eye,
so I couldn't see Sora.

Something about it made her seem fragile and
temporary. It scared me.

I quickly put down my hand.


7 :
Her beautiful image appeared without a sound.

She smiled gently.

[Kid]
Sora...?


{C2S224}
[Sora]
Yes...?

There was no real meaning in my question.

Maybe it was just that I wanted to see whether
or not she would answer me.

Given her fragile existence, there seemed to
be a danger that she might slip away at any
moment...

I was uneasy about it, and at the same time
felt a sort of awe about the mystery of it.

I felt drawn to her.


8 :

{C2S225}
[Sora]
"Is there anything else? Please don't stare at 
me like that."

Sora was blushing.

[Kid]
Oh... No. Nothing else.

Sora pinched her lips closed as if she was
slightly embarrassed.


9 :

{C2S226}
[Sora]
By the way, Kid-san...

[Kid]
Yeah?


{C2S227}
[Sora]
Kid-san... Have you ever seen the moon?

The question came out of nowhere.

My mind switched tracks and starting looking
for an appropriate answer.

[Kid]
Uh... The moon, huh...?

[Kid]
"I don't suppose this is a question I should 
have to think about, but..."

[Kid]
Having lost my memory and all...

[Kid]
I can't say for sure that I've seen it.

[Kid]
"But... I know what the moon is... and I'm 
pretty sure that I have seen it."


{C2S228}
[Sora]
I see.


10 :

{C2S229}
[Sora]
"Well, now let's say that you have seen a full 
moon."


11 :

{C2S230}
[Sora]
"And let's say that you closed your eyes. Do 
you think the moon would still be there?"

[Kid]
Haha. That's easy.

[Kid]
Of course it would.


12 :

{C2S231}
[Sora]
"And how about if everyone in the world closed 
their eyes all at the same time?"

[Kid]
I don't know what your point is, but...

[Kid]
"Even if everyone in the world closed their 
eyes, the moon wouldn't disappear."


13 :

{C2S232}
[Sora]
Really?

[Kid]
Yes.


{C2S233}
[Sora]
How can you be sure?

[Kid]
Just open your eyes, right?


14 :

{C2S234}
[Sora]
"That goes against the purpose of this 
exercise."


15 :

{C2S235}
[Sora]
"My question was whether or not there is 
any way of verifying that the moon exists 
if someone closes their eyes."

[Kid]
?


{C2S236}
[Sora]
"When you close your eyes, do you think this 
world still exists?"


16 :

{C2S237}
[Sora]
"What if I told you that not only myself, but 
all of LeMU was nothing but an RSD-generated 
illusion... What would you do then?"

[Kid]
...Huh?


{C2S238}
[Sora]
"Can you prove that the walls, the ceiling, 
and all of the scenery that you are 
observing actually exist?"

(So everything I'm looking at... is RSD...?)


I panicked, glancing around at my surroundings.


17 :

{C2S239}
[Sora]
Haha, I'm sorry. I was only joking.

[Kid]
That was a joke?


18 :

{C2S240}
[Sora]
Yes, LeMU really does exist.


{C2S241}
[Sora]
"You sounded so full of confidence when you 
answered... I thought I would tease you just 
a bit."

Sora giggled, covering her mouth.


19 :

{C2S242}
[Sora]
However, I can say this.


{C2S243}
[Sora]
"For humans to know the world around them, 
they must use one of their five senses."


{C2S244}
[Sora]
"If they lose all of these, they lose the 
ability to tell whether this world exists 
or not."


{C2S245}
[Sora]
"Another way of putting it might be to say 
that the perspective is in the eye of the 
beholder."


{C2S246}
[Sora]
"In this instance, I don't mean just sight, 
but hearing, smell, taste, and touch as well. All of 
the senses."


20 :

{C2S247}
[Sora]
"The point at which we perceive the world‡Lthat 
is perspective."


{C2S248}
[Sora]
And I...


21 :

{C2S249}
[Sora]
I... I am the same as the moon.


{C2S250}
[Sora]
Do you understand?

I felt like I had been able to get the gist of
what she meant.

Still... I didn't know exactly what she meant
by 'I am the same as the moon.'

I mustered an image of a silvery blue moon,
its light piercing through the dark night.

(I see... That's what she means.)

The answer came to me surprisingly quickly.

The moon didn't bark like a dog, it didn't
smell, and it didn't taste tart like an
apple, at least not as far as I knew.

The only way to be sure of the existence of
the moon was through its small gravitational
pull and its blue-white light.

Thinking of it in that way, the mysterious
charm of the moon and its transience were
things that Sora shared.

I believed the moon was there, so it was
there...

I believed that Sora was there, so she was
there...

Maybe that was what Sora wanted to say.

[Kid]
Yeah. I understand.

That was how I answered.


22 :
Sora's eyes lit up and her cheeks wrinkled
into a big smile.

And it might have been my imagination,
but I thought I smelled the tart scent of an apple
from somewhere.
