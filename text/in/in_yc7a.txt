1 :
‡LDawn.

I was in the middle of a white darkness.

Before I knew it... 'I' had become lost in
another world.

I didn't even have time to wonder where I was
before I found the answer.

The year was 2017...

I could see it.

I could see everything.

I already knew... what had happened at that
time...


2 :

{T7T082}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi...


{T7T083}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi, get up.


{T7T084}
[Tsugumi]
The taxi's here.


{C7A072}
[Takeshi]
O-okay...


3 :
Takeshi jumped out of bed and stood up.

He stretched his arms and loosened his
shoulders.

Takeshi and Tsugumi were still stuck in the
examination room of the research facility.


4 :

{T7T085}
[Tsugumi]
Chami. Chami... come here.


{T7T086}
[Tsugumi]
Come on, we've got to get going now.


5 :
Tsugumi scooped up Chami, who'd been running
around on the floor, and held him to her chest.


{T7T087}
[Tsugumi]
Huh...?

Bending over, Tsugumi let out a cry of alarm.


6 :

{C7A073}
[Takeshi]
What's wrong, Tsugumi?


{T7T088}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi... Under the bed.


{C7A074}
[Takeshi]
Under the bed? Mine?


7 :
He looked under the bed he had been sleeping
on.

Something was lying there...

Reaching out, he pulled whatever it was
closer to him.


{C7A075}
[Takeshi]
Huh?


{T7T089}
[Tsugumi]
Pipi...


8 :

{C7A076}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, Pipi, what's going on? What are you doing 
here?"

Takeshi picked Pipi up in both hands and
shook him lightly.

[Pipi]
.........


9 :
There was no response. All of the color
had vanished from his eyes.

He didn't move at all. Pipi was frozen... as
if he was dead.


10 :
Suddenly... a faded fragment of a memory
appeared in the back of 'my' mind.

Although it had been weathered and tinged by
the flow of the time, it was a scene that I
was positive I knew.

It was a scrap of a conversation between Sara
and Yubiseiakikana.


{S3A040}
[Y¤u'aki']
"But really, that Konnie... I tell you, that 
robot dog looks so much like the real thing 
that I'll bet he's treating it like a normal pet."


{S3A041}
[Sara]
"Hey, didn't you have a robotic dog at your 
house?"


{S3A042}
[Y¤u'aki']
Yup, sure do. Actually, it's my mom's.


{S3A043}
[Y¤u'aki']
"I think it's one of those really old types, 
but it just keeps ticking along happily. It 
never breaks."

If they were talking about Pipi, that would
mean...

Pipi was a robot... an electronic dog.


There wasn't any proof, but looking at Pipi's
motionless body, it was obvious that it wasn't
the dead body of an animal.

Like a wind-up toy that had stopped moving,
Pipi's limbs had frozen in an unnatural
position.


11 :
Takeshi and Tsugumi both observed Pipi, who
had become nothing more than a broken toy.

Takeshi opened his mouth slightly.

It seemed like he was about to say something.


12 :
‡LSuddenly!


13 :
‡LBOOOooom!


14 :
With a roaring sound, the whole room shook
violently.


15 :
Takeshi's body flipped like a small twig and
flew into the wall.

Tsugumi tumbled and danced through the air
to fall on the floor with a thud.


16 :

{C7A077A}
[Announcement]
"<Fünf Minuten 

{C7A077B}
vor der Implosion.>"

17 :

{C7A078}
[Takeshi]
Hey, WHAT did that announcement just say!?

Holding Pipi under his arm, Takeshi looked up
at the ceiling.


18 :
Tsugumi quickly got up.


19 :

{T7T091}
[Tsugumi]
"We've got five minutes... until this place 
implodes."


20 :

{C7A079}
[Takeshi]
FIVE MINUTES!?


{C7A080}
[Takeshi]
Give me a break!


21 :

{C7A081}
[Takeshi]
"Why do they gotta tell us when there's only 
FIVE minutes left!?"


{C7A082}
[Takeshi]
"Give us some more warning... for cryin' out 
loud!"


22 :

{T7T092}
[Tsugumi]
*Sigh*...


{T7T093}
[Tsugumi]
Anyway, we've only got five minutes.

Tsugumi shrugged her shoulders exaggeratedly
and stared at Takeshi.


23 :

{T7T094}
[Tsugumi]
"You've just got to accept reality. You could 
learn something from me, you know?"


24 :

{C7A083}
[Takeshi]
Hahaha, listen to yourself, Tsugumi.


{C7A084}
[Takeshi]
"Telling jokes at a time like this is more MY 
style, don't you think?"


25 :

{T7T095}
[Tsugumi]
Haha. Well, I guess you're right...


{T7T096}
[Tsugumi]
"But we should be 'fine' if we've got five 
minutes, right?"

A smile floated to her lips, and Tsugumi held
out a hand to Takeshi.


{C7A085}
[Takeshi]
Of course.

Takeshi took her hand firmly.


26 :

{1}{1}{1}{1}



{C7A086}
{16:0}<Vier Minuten vor der Implosion.>{16:1}


27 :
'I' continued to observe.

I accepted the world as it was, understood
it, and input it.

I had no feelings.

Feelings seemed to me to be something people
gave out in response to the world, as a way
of igniting change in their surroundings.

{16:4}

28 :
But there, at that time, I had no physical body.

I had no hands, no feet, no voice, no lungs,
no organs for generating heat.

In other words, I had no way of interacting
with the world.

Therefore, even if I were to have had
emotions, there was nothing I could do with
them.

The only thing I could do was watch...

{16:4}

29 :
Furthermore, the act of watching was
different to what would normally be associated
with 'sight'.

That type of 'vision' went far beyond
feelings or thoughts; it was completely
isolated, completely removed.

The passage of time had condensed down to one
moment, and that had exploded in front of me.

I had seen everything in one instant.

{16:4}

30 :
One instant...

Standing still in a world where time had
stopped, I saw everything.

{16:4}

31 :

{C7A087}
[Takeshi]
Yes! At least something's going right...


{C7A088}
[Takeshi]
The taxi's even waiting for us!


32 :

{T7T098}
[Tsugumi]
Well, of course.


{T7T099}
[Tsugumi]
It's a TAXI...


{T7T100}
[Tsugumi]
"They aren't going to just leave us 
high-tipping customers here."


33 :
In front of them, the small submarine bobbed
gently in the waves.


34 :

{C7A093A}
[Announcement]
"<Drei Minuten 

{C7A093B}
vor der Implosion.>"

35 :
Three minutes until implosion‡L

Takeshi and Tsugumi hurriedly scrambled to
the sub and jumped down the hatch.


36 :
Tsugumi slid over to the driver's side of the
cockpit, checked to see if the gauges were in
order, and flipped some switches.

The hatch overhead closed automatically.

Tsugumi took the controls.


37 :
The mini-sub made bubbling sounds and sank
quickly into the water.

As soon as they passed under the bottom of
IBF, the ocean current pushed on the heavy
hull of their vessel.

Takeshi looked out into the ocean from a small
window attached to the wall.


38 :
LeMU was... breaking apart...

The frame started to warp and fold on itself
like some crumpled old newspaper...

Partitions cracked into small pieces and
fluttered in the water as if they were petals
falling from a flower...

Letting out its final breath, LeMU spewed out
fine air bubbles into the sea, which flowed
gently in the current...

{16:4}

39 :
From the twisted wreckage, black smoke rose
in the water.

The pieces of iron drifting in the ocean
glittered from the sunlight coming from above.

At the edge of his rapidly clearing field of
view, the sinking shadow of the brutal
wreckage could be seen...

Paradise sank into deep blue darkness,
raising a spine-chilling death cry.

{16:4}

40 :

{T7T106}
[Tsugumi]
What... do we do from here?

Tsugumi asked in a quiet voice.

The small egg-shaped vessel holding the two
of them headed silently toward the surface.


{C7A094}
[Takeshi]
There's so much that I want to do.


{C7A095}
[Takeshi]
But first...


{C7A096}
[Takeshi]
I'm thinking more about where to start.

Takeshi spoke as he placed the motionless
Pipi on the seat next to him.


{T7T107}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm...


{C7A097}
[Takeshi]
"What about you, Tsugumi? What do you want to 
do?"

[Tsugumi]
.........


{C7A098}
[Takeshi]
What, you didn't like the question?


{T7T108}
[Tsugumi]
No, it's not that.


{T7T109}
[Tsugumi]
Can I have a minute to think about it?


{C7A099}
[Takeshi]
Sure.

Takeshi smiled.

But that smile would soon fade...


41 :
Wham...

A heavy ringing filled the submarine.


42 :

{C7A100}
[Takeshi]
What?


43 :

{T7T110}
[Tsugumi]
What was that sound?

Tsugumi looked at Takeshi worriedly...


{C7A101}
[Takeshi]
I... dunno.


44 :
Beep, beep...

The operating console made a funny sound.


{T7T111}
[Tsugumi]
What's that noise...?


{C7A102}
[Takeshi]
No clue...


{C7A103}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, something just came up on that screen 
over there."

The monitor behind Tsugumi started blinking.


{T7T112}
[Tsugumi]
What does it say...?


{C7A104}
[Takeshi]
"You're closer than I am, so why don't you turn 
around and look at it yourself?"


{T7T113}
[Tsugumi]
N-no...


{T7T114}
[Tsugumi]
I don't want to see it...


{T7T115}
[Tsugumi]
I've got... a really bad feeling about this.


{C7A105}
[Takeshi]
Don't be so selfish.

Looking like he didn't have any other choice,
Takeshi peeked at the monitor.


{C7A106}
[Takeshi]
Ah... Which one, which one...


{C7A107}
[Takeshi]
Uumm...


{C7A108}
[Takeshi]
'Low battery'...


{C7A109}
[Takeshi]
...That's what it says.


45 :
As if responding to what Takeshi said, the
lights in the sub suddenly went out.

The monitor went dark. All of the power
went out.

The electrical equipment went silent.

The only thing still working was the analog
pressure gauge.

Depth‡L63 meters.

Internal pressure‡L12.5 atmospheres.


{T7T116}
[Tsugumi]
Ta-Takeshi...


46 :
Tsugumi's voice was shaking.


{C7A110}
[Takeshi]
It's okay. We're going to be fine.


{C7A111}
[Takeshi]
Stop looking like you're going to cry.

Depth‡L64 meters.

With its momentum lost... the submarine began
sinking slowly, very slowly.

Residual air pressure: 0.

Ballast Tank: Unable to drain.


{C7A112}
[Takeshi]
Wonderful, we hitched a ride on a junker...


{C7A113}
[Takeshi]
"You know, this cab always seems to stall on 
these country roads..."


{C7A114}
[Takeshi]
I'm terribly sorry, esteemed passenger...

[Tsugumi]
.........

Depth‡L65 meters.

Takeshi looked at the aft hatch.

It had a two-ply hatch...

The inner side was made of reinforced glass
and FRP, while the outer side had a door made
from high-strength steel.


{C7A115}
[Takeshi]
"Hey, you think if we let some of the high-pressure 
gas out of the hatch, we'd start 
rising again?"


{T7T117}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{T7T118}
[Tsugumi]
"I don't think we'll go straight up, and our 
momentum would be limited."


{T7T119}
[Tsugumi]
"Not to mention the fact that if we do that, 
we'll start flooding..."


{T7T120}
[Tsugumi]
"Because we don't have any spare compressed 
air."


{T7T121}
[Tsugumi]
"And we don't have enough buoyancy in the main 
fuselage."


{C7A116}
[Takeshi]
Buoyancy...


{T7T122}
[Tsugumi]
We've got to get rid of ballast...


{C7A117}
[Takeshi]
Ballast...


{T7T123}
[Tsugumi]
"The valve used to release ballast is usually 
electronically controlled."


{T7T124}
[Tsugumi]
But now, we're...


{C7A118}
[Takeshi]
Alright, let's just stay calm.


{C7A119}
[Takeshi]
"Judging by how fast we're sinking... we only 
need to be a little bit lighter, right?"


{C7A120}
[Takeshi]
"If we can get rid of a few dozen kilograms, 
we should be fine."


{C7A121}
[Takeshi]
"Why not try pulling out a few of those 
machines over there? That should make us 
lighter."


{T7T125}
[Tsugumi]
You think it's going to be easy?


{C7A122}
[Takeshi]
"Well... they seem to be welded on fairly well. 
Probably not easy to do bare-handed."


{C7A123}
[Takeshi]
And unfortunately, we don't have any tools...


{T7T126}
[Tsugumi]
So that's it, huh...

Tsugumi bit her lip and looked down.


{C7A124}
[Takeshi]
Yeah...


{C7A125}
[Takeshi]
We're screwed...


47 :
Depth‡L67 meters.

They were sinking...

Without any electricity, the submarine was
just a hunk of metal.


{T7T127}
[Tsugumi]
Looks like we celebrated too soon...


{T7T128}
[Tsugumi]
Doesn't it...


{T7T129}
[Tsugumi]
Hahaha...


{T7T130}
[Tsugumi]
So stupid...


{T7T131}
[Tsugumi]
I'm so stupid...

Tears began to fill Tsugumi's eyes...


{T7T132}
[Tsugumi]
Ah!?

Tsugumi raised her voice.

A single tear fell, rolling down cheek.


{T7T133}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what are you doing, Takeshi!?


{C7A126}
[Takeshi]
What... you can't tell by looking?


{C7A127}
[Takeshi]
I'm opening the hatch.


{T7T134}
[Tsugumi]
"That's why I'm asking you! What are you 
doing!?"


{C7A128}
[Takeshi]
Do you even need to ask?


{T7T135}
[Tsugumi]
Stop it!


{T7T136}
[Tsugumi]
What are you planning to do!?

Tsugumi grabbed onto Takeshi's arm.


{C7A129}
[Takeshi]
Don't try to stop me...


48 :
He threw off Tsugumi's arm and raised the
glass hatch.

It was just large enough for one person to go
through.


{C7A130}
[Takeshi]
Please don't touch me...


{C7A131}
[Takeshi]
Don't touch me.


{T7T137}
[Tsugumi]
No! I won't let you go!

Tsugumi grabbed onto Takeshi's arm fiercely.


49 :

{T7T138}
[Tsugumi]
I don't care if I die... I'm not letting go.

Depth‡L69 meters.

They wouldn't stop sinking.

Slowly and steadily, they fell.

Headed for the dark bottom of the ocean.


{C7A132}
[Takeshi]
Hmmm...


{C7A133}
[Takeshi]
You know, you really are selfish.

[Tsugumi]
.........


{C7A134}
[Takeshi]
Hey, Tsugumi...?


{C7A135}
[Takeshi]
Do you know what the Archimedes principle is?


{T7T139}
[Tsugumi]
Huh?

For a moment, Tsugumi's grip relaxed.


50 :
In that brief instant, Takeshi tore himself
forcefully away from her grasp.


51 :
He quickly opened the glass hatch and slipped
to the back of the airlock.

The area between the hatches was extremely
cramped.

Takeshi closed the glass hatch from within
and shut the latch right away.

They had passed a depth of 70 meters.


52 :

{T7T140}
[Tsugumi]
Takeshi! Takeshi!


53 :

{T7T141}
[Tsugumi]
"What are you doing!? Open it up! Get out of 
there!"

Tsugumi wildly pounded on the reinforced
glass with her fist.


{C7A136}
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi... What are you saying?


{C7A137}
[Takeshi]
"The glass is pretty thick, you know. I really 
can't hear very well."


{T7T142}
[Tsugumi]
You stupid idiot! Open it up this instant!


{T7T143}
[Tsugumi]
What are you thinking!?


54 :
Tears started falling from Tsugumi's wide-open
eyes.

Tsugumi desperately pounded the flat of her
tear-covered hand against the glass.


{C7A138}
[Takeshi]
Hey, wait a second, didn't you...


{C7A139}
[Takeshi]
"I thought you knew about the Archimedes 
principle...?"


{C7A140}
[Takeshi]
"I mean, I think you were the one that taught 
me about it."


{C7A141}
[Takeshi]
I guess you'd know that. Sorry. Hahaha...


{T7T144}
[Tsugumi]
This isn't funny! Stop joking!


{T7T145}
[Tsugumi]
This isn't... It's not about that!


{T7T146}
[Tsugumi]
You fool... Takeshi, you idiot!

Tsugumi sobbed as she screamed.


{C7A142}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, I'm an idiot. The biggest one there is!


{C7A143}
[Takeshi]
You didn't know that? Tsugumi...

Takeshi put one hand behind him on the other
hatch.


55 :
And slowly turned the handle.


{T7T147}
[Tsugumi]
Ta... Takeshi...?

Tsugumi froze in place.


56 :

{T7T148}
[Tsugumi]
No...


{T7T149}
[Tsugumi]
Do you really...


{T7T150}
[Tsugumi]
Want... to... die...?


57 :

{C7A146}
[Takeshi]
Don't worry.


{C7A147}
[Takeshi]
I may be stupid, but...


{C7A148}
[Takeshi]
I'm not that stupid.


58 :
As he said that, Takeshi continued to turn the
handle on the other door without stopping.

Depth‡L73 meters.


{T7T151}
[Tsugumi]
Please...


{T7T152}
[Tsugumi]
Don't leave me...


{T7T153}
[Tsugumi]
Don't leave me all by myself!


{C7A149}
[Takeshi]
There you go, always worrying...

Takeshi forced a smile.


59 :

{C7A150}
[Takeshi]
"I keep telling you it's going to be okay, 
right?"


{T7T154}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...


{C7A151}
[Takeshi]
You want to live, don't you...?


{T7T155}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...


{C7A152}
[Takeshi]
So live!


60 :

{C7A153}
[Takeshi]
As long as you're alive, live!


{C7A154}
[Takeshi]
Don't worry...


61 :

{C7A155}
[Takeshi]
I...


{C7A156}
[Takeshi]
I'm not going to die.


62 :
‡L74 meters.

The hatch on the bottom of the submarine
opened.

The air which had been compressed in the
airlock was jettisoned into the ocean.


63 :
Takeshi's body shot out like a bullet into the
water.

Bubbles flew everywhere.

An infinite number of white bubbles floated
toward the surface.

They seemed like powdery snow caught in the
wind...

Snow that flew toward the heavens.


{T7T156}
[Tsugumi]
........!

He could no longer hear her voice.


64 :
On the other side of the glass, he could
make out her blurry outline.

Tsugumi's face was covered with tears, broken
with sadness...


65 :
‡L75 meters.

Takeshi paddled through the water, holding onto
the railing.

He closed the outside hatch.

He couldn't see her anymore.

‡L76 meters.

He let go of his last source of support.

And kicked the sub.

Takeshi's body spun out as if it were dancing
into a blue world.

‡L77 meters.

He sank toward the bottom of the ocean.

White bubbles extended out beyond his field of
vision...

Wobbling slowly upward to the heavens.

.........

......

...

Depth‡L119 meters.

Everything that he could see dissipated into
the water.

Outlines faded. Nothing came into focus, only
light and shadow reflected in his eyes.

There was one thing, however, that he could
see clearly through the haze.

A small white dot swaying in the distance.

Dazzling light from the sky poured down on
him from a single point. Its image burned
into both his eyes.

Blub... He let out his last gasp of air.

Cold seawater poured into his lungs.

A blanket of blue darkness covered him in his
final resting place.

His limbs, sprawled out on the rocky ocean
floor, had stopped moving like a marionette
with its strings cut.


66 :
[Kid]
Dad...

Back in the world of 2034...

When I returned to consciousness I was crying.

Feelings overcame me in torrents, rushing
through me hotly.

'Dad... is dead...'

The weight of my sadness pressed down on me,
and a sense of futility tore a hole in my
heart.

But... it was no time to be overcome by sadness.

Wiping the wetness from my cheeks, I looked
at my surroundings.

A new day was breaking, just as it had been
in 2017.

Through my tears, the blue sky and ocean came
into my vision.


67 :
It seemed that I was above the floating island.

I could analyze the situation calmly, but the
tears wouldn't stop.

I wiped them away with the palm of my hand
and licked the large drops as they rolled
past my mouth.

Squeezing my eyes shut tightly, I took in deep
breaths to calm down.

I trembled slightly as I let out a sigh and
looked around at my surroundings again.

It was definitely above the floating island...

The wind was blowing lightly and the green
trees were swaying gently.

The morning sun was letting out golden rays
onto the surface of the ocean.

It had been a while since I had been
outdoors... The wide blue sky... The smell
of the warm humid breeze...

But as beautiful as it seemed, it didn't help
me one bit.

Rather, the richness of it all made me feel
even more alienated.

(I'm all alone... and so terribly sad...)


I wiped away the tears which continued to
flow and tried hard to suppress my urge to
cry out.

I had to think...

It was no time to be crying...

I shook my head repeatedly and tried with all
of my strength to collect my atrophied
thoughts.

[Kid]
Think, think, THINK...

First, I needed to grasp the situation I was in.

I followed the threads of my memory...

I remembered having gotten safely out of
LeMU but had no memories after that.

I had no idea of what had happened after that.

I couldn't imagine that I had been standing
outside all night...

[Kid]
H-huh?

I suddenly realized that nobody else was there.

As I began to walk on grass, I looked wildly
in all directions.

Soon...

I became aware of one solitary figure.

It was Kaburaki.

He had his back to a tree trunk and was
staring out at the vast ocean.

I ran over to him and screamed at him.


68 :
[Kid]
Why would you do something like this!?

[Kaburaki]
........

[Kid]
Answer me! I know everything now!

Kaburaki was silent.

He wouldn't even look at me.

It was obvious that he was the closest person
to being responsible for everything happening
here.

'Kuranari Takeshi'‡Lmy father's name.

He had used that name to deceive us the whole
time.

I drew even closer.

[Kid]
Say something! Don't just stand there!

[Kaburaki]
.........

[Kid]
I said say something!

I grabbed onto his shirt.


69 :

{C7A000}
[Kaburaki]
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you anything...

Kaburaki's eyes were wet.

He seemed to be thinking deeply about
something as he gazed at me.


{C7A001}
[Kaburaki]
But... I will tell you this...


{C7A002}
[Kaburaki]
This isn't over, okay?


{C7A003}
[Kaburaki]
It all starts from here...


{C7A004}
[Kaburaki]
Yeah... All of it starts from right now.

I relaxed my grip.


70 :
Kaburaki didn't say anything more and walked
away gazing in the direction of the distant
horizon.

I stood there vacantly staring at his back
while it became smaller and smaller.


71 :
Somebody tapped me on the shoulder.

I turned around and...


72 :
Sora was standing right in front of me.


{C7A005}
[Sora]
We've been waiting for you.

'What are you doing here...?'

The thought didn't reach my lips.

There clearly was no RSD on the floating
island.

But she had just... tapped me on the shoulder.


I couldn't process the information and stood
there gaping in confusion.

I reached out to touch Sora's arm
absentmindedly.

Her skin was smooth... its texture slightly
elastic... and warm to touch...


{C7A006}
[Sora]
Please come this way...

Sora grinned.

There was Sora, smiling as always.

I felt saved by her smile.


73 :
I was led by Sora into the forest.

A small stone-covered path was overgrown in a
deep thicket...

The tips of the trees stretched up high,
almost entangling one another. Hardly any
light squeezed through.

There was no breeze there either.

The air was wet, and everything felt heavy and
stagnant.

The small stone path snaked around randomly,
and I soon lost all sense of direction as I
continued walking.

I moved forward along that passage with no
exit.

For some reason, I didn't say a word to Sora,
whose back was in front of me.


74 :
I walked up beside her and interlaced my
fingers in hers.

I didn't know why I did that.


Was I just curious, or had I wanted a sense of
security?

Sora looked over at me and smiled.

Maybe the reason I grabbed onto her was just
because I wanted to see her smile at me.

Not long afterward...

We finally emerged from the forest.

My field of view widened, and beyond spread
out an area of lush green grass and the rich
blue ocean.

My line of sight was drawn to the back of
someone very familiar to me.


75 :
Y¤u was standing right in the center of the
open space. She was standing with her
back to me.

And someone else... a woman who looked just
like her. They were facing each other and
standing still.

I braced against the rising tide of emotion
within me and went to stand over by them.

I flashed a look back.

Sora was standing at the entrance to the
forest and didn't appear to be coming closer.

In the center of that area were Y¤u, the lady,
and me.

The other lady...

Of course, I knew her name.

Tanaka... Yubiseiharukana...

She had been infected with the Curé virus, and
although she seemed young, she didn't look
quite seventeen.

It was probably since her cells had divided
for five years, which had caused her to age
slightly.

In other words, her body was that of a 23-year-old,
but she was actually 35.

I looked over at Y¤u (Yubiseiakikana),
standing next to me.

She had her hand curled into a fist and was
glaring at her mother.

She was so furious that she was shaking.

I realized...

That the person who had been manipulating
everything behind the scenes had been the
person standing in front of
me‡LYubiseiharukana, Y¤u's mother.

She'd been up there safe and sound on the
island, relaxing, looking down at our plight
and probably laughing the whole time.

I glared over at her along with Y¤u.


She appeared indifferent to our stares
and said nonchalantly...


{C7A007}
[Y¤u'haru']
Do you have any questions?

I laughed without thinking.

What the hell kind of thing was that to say...?

[Kid]
Why...

[Kid]
Why would you do something like this!?


{C7A008}
[Y¤u'haru']
In order to call forth Blick Winkel.

[Kid]
What the hell is Blick Winkel!?


{C7A009}
[Y¤u'haru']
You already know that, don't you?


{C7A010}
[Y¤u'haru']
Blick Winkel...


{C7A011}
[Y¤u'haru']
Is... you.

[Kid]
Me? I'm... Blick Winkel?


{C7A012}
[Y¤u'haru']
Yes.


{C7A013}
[Y¤u'haru']
I'm not talking to Hokuto.


{C7A014}
[Y¤u'haru']
"I'm talking to the 'perspective' on the 
other side of Hokuto."

[Kid]
...Perspective?


{C7A015}
[Y¤u'haru']
Yes.


{C7A016}
[Y¤u'haru']
The third eye‡LBlick Winkel...


{C7A017}
[Y¤u'haru']
The 'you' on the other side of Hokuto...


{C7A018}
[Y¤u'haru']
"That's right, the part of 'you' that's 
looking at me right now..."


{C7A019}
[Y¤u'haru']
It is you who I am talking about.

[Kid]
.........


{C7A020}
[Y¤u'haru']
From the beginning, you've been the Kid.


{C7A021}
[Y¤u'haru']
"When you overlapped with Hokuto, he lost his 
memory and became you."


{C7A022}
[Y¤u'haru']
So, it makes sense that he had amnesia.


{C7A023}
[Y¤u'haru']
You had never lived in this world before.


{C7A024}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You have no history here, no memories of this 
place."


{C7A025}
[Y¤u'haru']
"On May 1st, 2034 at 3:17 p.m.‡Lyou uttered 
your first words in this world, Kid."

[Kid]
.........


76 :

{C7A026}
[Y¤u'haru']
You aren't from this world.


{C7A027}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You are looking down at this world from one 
dimension higher than this."


{C7A028}
[Y¤u'haru']
"That's why you can see the future and the 
past."


{C7A029}
[Y¤u'haru']
Well... that's not all.


{C7A030}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You can probably also see other time 
continua."


{C7A031}
[Y¤u'haru']
"The reason the Kid could see the future is that 
you know all there is to know about this 
world."


{C7A032}
[Y¤u'haru']
"It only makes sense that you didn't respond 
to the name Hokuto."


{C7A033}
[Y¤u'haru']
I mean, your real name isn't Hokuto, right?

[Kid]
...I'm... I'm...


{C7A034}
[Y¤u'haru']
You don't have to be afraid.


{C7A035}
[Y¤u'haru']
You don't have to lie to yourself.


{C7A036}
[Y¤u'haru']
Won't you show me your true self?


{C7A037}
[Y¤u'haru']
Answer me truthfully...


77 :

{C7A038}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You aren't really a kid named Hokuto, are 
you?"

[Kid]
.........


78 :
{16:0}Who... am I?{16:1}

{16:0}Who... are you?{16:1}

{16:0}I am... Hokuto.{16:1}

{16:0}Who... are you?{16:1}

{16:0}Who... am I?{16:1}

{16:0}You are... Hokuto.{16:1}

{16:0}I am not... Hokuto...{16:1}

{16:0}I am not Hokuto... I am... me.{16:1}

79 :
{16:0}I am... me.{16:1}

{16:0}Yes... I remember...{16:1}

{16:0}I am... I am me.{16:1}

{16:0}I have... watched... your world...{1}
For... so long... watching...{16:1}

{16:4}

80 :
{16:0}I am but a perspective...{16:1}

{16:0}An eye that transcends{1}
dimensional boundaries...{16:1}

{16:0}I am the third eye...{16:1}

{16:0}I am...{16:1}

{16:0}I am...{16:1}


81 :

{16:0x}Blick... Winkel...{16:1}

{16:4}

82 :
[Blick Winkel]
I am...

[Blick Winkel]
I am... I remember now...

[Blick Winkel]
I am... not from your world... am I...?

[Blick Winkel]
I am... not... Hokuto... am I...?


83 :

{C7A039}
[Y¤u'haru']
Haha, it sure has been a long time...

[Blick Winkel]
...A long time?


{C7A040}
[Y¤u'haru']
No, don't worry about it...


{C7A041}
[Y¤u'haru']
Thank you for showing yourself...

[Blick Winkel]
Why...?

[Blick Winkel]
Please? Tell me, why?

[Blick Winkel]
Why did you have to do this?


84 :

{C7A042}
[Y¤u'haru']
I already told you.


{C7A043}
[Y¤u'haru']
"In order to... Well, I suppose you could call 
it a summoning."

[Blick Winkel]
"In order to reach me, did you really have to 
do something so reckless and dangerous?"


{C7A044}
[Y¤u'haru']
Yes...


{C7A045}
[Y¤u'haru']
Just as I explained earlier...


{C7A046}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You have been looking down on our world from 
your dimension... right?"

[Blick Winkel]
.........


{C7A047}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Let's say that there was a conscious being 
from the second dimension."


{C7A048}
[Y¤u'haru']
"What do you think that the second dimensional 
being would have to do in order to make 
contact with the third dimension?"


{C7A049}
[Y¤u'haru']
"For instance, on an XY plane, there are some 
two-dimensional beings, points A, B, and C..."


{C7A050}
[Y¤u'haru']
"And in XYZ space, you have a 
three-dimensional being, point D."


{C7A051}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Points A, B, and C can only move on an XY 
axis."


{C7A052}
[Y¤u'haru']
So how can they draw point D to them?


{C7A053}
[Y¤u'haru']
"You have point C move on the same line as 
points A and B."


{C7A054}
[Y¤u'haru']
"When that happens, points A, B, and C form a 
line and create a common plane with point D."


{C7A055}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Meaning point D becomes part of the same 
plane as points A, B, and C."


{C7A056}
[Y¤u'haru']
"When that happens, point D has the illusion 
that it's in the same world as A, B, and C for 
the first time."


{C7A057}
[Y¤u'haru']
That's what we did...


{C7A058}
[Y¤u'haru']
"In creating a world where you couldn't tell 
if it was 2034 or 2017..."


{C7A059}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Point D... In other words, we were able to 
create the illusion that the fourth dimensional 
being 'the perspective: Blick Winkel' was in 
our same reality."


{C7A060}
[Y¤u'haru']
"And you showed yourself to us, descending 
into the space in front of us..."


{C7A061}
[Y¤u'haru']
We were waiting for you... All of us...


{C7A062}
[Y¤u'haru']
We've been waiting for you for so long...

[Blick Winkel]
Why? Why were you waiting for me?

[Blick Winkel]
What reason could you have... to call for me?


{C7A063}
[Y¤u'haru']
We just were following your directions.

[Blick Winkel]
Huh?


{C7A064}
[Y¤u'haru']
You called yourself.

[Blick Winkel]
What do you mean?


{C7A065}
[Y¤u'haru']
You needed us and we needed you.

[Blick Winkel]
Why?


85 :

{C7A066}
[Y¤u'haru']
"In order to save £o¢o and Kuranari, we needed 
to borrow your powers."

[Blick Winkel]
To save £o¢o and Takeshi...?


{C7A067}
[Y¤u'haru']
We are powerless to fight the flow of time.


{C7A068}
[Y¤u'haru']
There's nothing we can do about the past.


86 :

{C7A069}
[Y¤u'haru']
But you can.


{C7A070}
[Y¤u'haru']
"The reason being that someone like you, from 
the fourth dimension..."


{C7A071}
[Y¤u'haru']
Can travel freely through time...


87 :
I saw it then. I saw everything.

My consciousness had detached from Hokuto
and gone back to the world of 2017.

Hokuto's feelings and thoughts hadn't
reached me.

But our perspectives had overlapped.

An observer with no feelings...

All I could do was witness events as they
passed...


88 :
The submarine that Tsugumi was on had
continued floating up and had already made it
to the surface.

It was a small, white vessel, rocking in the
waves...

Shut inside the small submarine, Tsugumi's
shoulders drooped as she sat in the cockpit in
shock.

Having lost everything, she sat there
soullessly, looking as empty as a glass
ornament.

Just then...


89 :
Whiiiirrr...

The light came back on in Pipi's eyes, who
moments before had been motionless at
Tsugumi's feet.

He got up quickly.

[Tsugumi]
.........

She seemed to be unable to comprehend what was
happening.

Pipi shook off his body, flashed a look up to
Tsugumi's face, and walked over to stand in front
of the glass hatch.


90 :
Scratch, scratch...

Pipi began pawing at the hatch.


{C7A157}
[Tsugumi]
Wh-what's wrong...?

Tsugumi mumbled weakly.


{PIPI_12}
[Pipi]
*Bow*! *Bow-wow*! *Wooof*!

Pipi stood facing the hatch and barked.


{C7A158}
[Tsugumi]
...You want... to go outside?


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

Tsugumi's gaze wandered about as if she was
thinking something over.

Pipi continued barking the whole time.

The submarine rocked gently in the waves...

Tsugumi put both her hands on the wall and
looked outside of the window.


{C7A159}
[Tsugumi]
...Um... Okay.

Saying that, Tsugumi opened not the glass hatch,
but the heavy one on top of the submarine.



91 :
A pure white light flashed into the interior
of the ship like the sharp edge of a blade.

Tsugumi squinted against the brightness...

She held up one hand to fend off the light
and used the other to push on the hatch with
all her might.

She picked up Pipi and brought him outside of
the boat.

Pipi kicked hard against the hull to fly into
the air and splashed into the ocean with
a beautiful arc.


92 :
One mechanical dog, swimming in the ocean...

Down, down, down he went...


93 :
He didn't stop at 17 meters... 34 meters... 51
meters...

...68 meters... 85 meters... 102 meters...


94 :
‡L119 meters.

The hard rock surface deep in the blue
darkness.

A man's body lay on the ocean bed...

Pipi bit onto his clothing and pulled.

Was he trying to bring him somewhere?

Of course, the man didn't move at all.

Pipi bit on some exposed flesh.

The man didn't respond. His life had expired.

All that remained there was a cold
corpse... Nothing more.

Something had fallen to his side.


95 :
A disc...

A terabyte disc...

Pipi picked it up in his mouth and left the
body behind.


96 :
He started swimming in the ocean...

Going sideways, he cut across the water...

At the bottom of the dark sea... there was
only the cold surface of the rock and dark
black seawater.

Occasionally, delicate streams of light would
pass by...

Perhaps Pipi had found something?

Without hesitation, Pipi swam straight toward
the white building.


97 :
‡LSplash!

The face of a single dog broke the surface of
the pool.

He stuck out his front legs onto the edge and
climbed onto the floor.

He shook himself off.

Small droplets of water flew off in all
directions, forming a mist.

The terabyte disc was still in his mouth.


Pipi ran.

He lost his footing on the wet floor, slipped,
and fell.

Standing up again, he readied himself and
dashed off at a full gallop.


98 :
His pliant body shot like a coiled spring...


Pipi ran down the passages, breaking to the
right and turning to the left. He was aiming
for something.


{C7A160}
[???]
Pipi...


{C7A161}
[???]
...Pi... pi...

Only her voice could be heard.


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

Pipi barked loudly.

The disc fell out of his mouth to spin across
the floor with a rattle.

Pipi quickly braked with all four legs, turned
around to get the disc, and dashed across the
floor again.


{C7A162}
[???]
Pipi...


{C7A163}
[???]
...Take... pyon...


99 :
When he turned the corner, her figure jumped
out at him.

She was lying down in the middle of the
passage.

Pipi ran over to her side.

He set down the disc on the floor and bit at her
clothes, starting to pull on her.

He tried desperately to pull her along, but
just as he could not budge the man before, it
was too much for his small frame to move her.


{PIPI_15}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof* *woof*!


{C7A164}
[???]
Pi-Pipi...

She opened her eyes weakly.


{C7A165}
[???]
Oh... Where did you go...?


{C7A166}
[???]
I was... so worried... about you...

Pipi licked her face.


{C7A167}
[???]
...Where is... everyone...?


{PIPI_05}
[Pipi]
*Whine*... *whine*...


{C7A168}
[???]
I don't understand when you whine...

Pipi pulled on her clothes and scratched her
shoulder, grunting with his effort.


{PIPI_14}
[Pipi]
*Woof*! *Woof* *woof*! *Woof*!

Perhaps he realized there was nothing he
could do, but Pipi barked frantically.


{C7A169}
[???]
Hey, Pipi...?


{C7A170}
[???]
...Let's... go... home...?


{C7A171}
[???]
Daddy and... Mommy... are waiting... for us...


{C7A172}
[???]
So...


{C7A173}
[???]
...Let's... go...


{C7A174}
[???]
Go... home...


{C7A175}
[???]
Okay...? Pipi...


100 :
She closed her eyes quietly.


{PIPI_15}
[Pipi]
*Bow*! *Wow*! *Wow*!

No matter how much he barked at her, she
wouldn't open her eyes.

Pipi started walking around the area.

He finally stopped, picked up the disc
that he had left on the floor, and started
running again.


101 :
Going back the way he came, he made it to the
pool.

Without hesitating, he threw himself into the
water.


102 :
He started swimming in the ocean...

Rising up, and up...

He didn't stop... 102 meters... 85 meters...
68 meters...

51 meters... 34 meters... 17 meters...

‡L0 meters.


103 :
‡LSplash!

Pipi's face broke the surface.

The blue expanse of the sky loomed above him...

The sun had changed the water to a silvery
color.


104 :
Yubiseiharukana was there to pick Pipi up.


She took the terabyte disc from his mouth and
looked at the digital recording of IBF that
Pipi had taken with his eyes.

That was the first time that she realized the
truth...

That left behind at the bottom of the ocean
in the research facility was a single girl...

{16:4}

105 :
That girl was... £o¢o.

'It was Yagami £o¢o', Yubiseiharukana said.

{16:4}

106 :

{C7A176}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Kaburaki and I, who had been infected by the 
Tief Blau virus, were rescued by the salvage vessel."


{C7A177}
[Y¤u'haru']
But £o¢o wasn't aboard the submarine with us.


{C7A178}
[Y¤u'haru']
"I was unconscious then, so I hadn't 
noticed..."


{C7A179}
[Y¤u'haru']
But I realized it afterward.


{C7A180}
[Y¤u'haru']
£o¢o had been left behind in IBF...

[Blick Winkel]
I can't... believe it...


107 :

{C6A411}
[Mission Control]
This is Insel Null Control. Please respond.


{C6A412}
[Takeshi]
This is the examination room in IBF Three, over!


{C6A413}
[Mission Control]
Thank goodness... That's where you were.


{C6A414}
[Mission Control]
"A little while ago, we got a message from the 
dispatch team that they couldn't find you. 
You had us worried there."


{C6A415}
[Takeshi]
I'm sorry, I was out for a bit.


{C6A416}
[Mission Control]
"We were able to rescue the other three 
people in the examination room, and they're 
being cared for in the salvage vessel."


{C6A417}
[Takeshi]
Is everyone okay!?


{C6A418}
[Mission Control]
"We can't say for sure... Their conditions are 
serious."


{C6A419}
[Mission Control]
"We're fighting against time. The submersible 
is going to surface soon, and we'll transfer 
them to a floating medical center."


{C6A420}
[Takeshi]
Okay. You take care of them.


108 :
[Blick Winkel]
The control center said...

[Blick Winkel]
"They had rescued the other three people in the 
examination room..."

[Blick Winkel]
So why...?


{C7A187}
[Y¤u'haru']
"Those 'three people' were... me, Kaburaki, 
and..."


{C7A188}
[Y¤u'haru']
One more. My father‡LTanaka Yoichi.

[Blick Winkel]
Why...

[Blick Winkel]
Why did the rescue team leave £o¢o there!?


{C7A189}
[Y¤u'haru']
"I heard it from them afterward, but they 
said they couldn't find her..."

[Blick Winkel]
Oh... I remember...

[Blick Winkel]
"By the time the rescue squad got there, £o¢o 
wasn't in the examination room..."

[Blick Winkel]
"I don't know why, but for some reason, £o¢o 
had gotten out of her capsule pod."

[Blick Winkel]
"So the only people left there were Y¤u, 
Kaburaki, and Yoichi-san, who was already 
dead..."


{C7A190}
[Y¤u'haru']
Yeah...

[Blick Winkel]
"Y¤u and Kaburaki's condition was extremely 
serious."

[Blick Winkel]
"So they put the highest priority on saving 
the lives of those two... and the rescue squad 
left..."

[Blick Winkel]
"Meaning they... overlooked £o¢o... No... they 
abandoned her..."

[Y¤u'haru']
.........

Y¤u pinched her eyes shut, her face distorted
in sadness.

[Blick Winkel]
What do you want me to do?


109 :
By the time these words left my mouth, I had
already returned to 2017.


110 :
To that vast blue world...

On the bottom of the ocean lay the cruelly
broken body of a man...

It didn't move...

What do you want me to do?

I'm not from this world.

The only thing that I can do is look...

Just look on...

You wanted to show me this dead body...?

It makes me sad.

Terribly sad.

He had thrown his life away to protect the
woman he loved. It was heartbreaking.

His body had lost all warmth...

I kept staring

‡LJust then!


111 :
(Dad!)

(DAD!)

(DAAAAD!)

My awareness split, broke, fractured, as a
powerful force of will woke up inside of me.

I was infused with an overwhelming passion.

Hokuto's indomitable belief, willpower,
emotions, and psyche were like a raging
inferno that engulfed me.

That ferocious and wild power raged within
me and superseded my existence.

It exploded in a shower of white sparks of
light and roared like thunder.

Overwhelmed by the raw vigor, I withdrew.

It was no place for me to be...

Hokuto exploded with bottled-up emotions and
threw his instinctive power free into
darkness.


{C7A191}
[Kid]
Dad! DAD! Don't you die on me!


{C7A192}
[Kid]

{C7A199}
[Kid]
"You swore you wouldn't let even one person

[Kid]
£o¢o is still in the research facility!


{C7A201}
[Kid]
If you don't do something, she's going to die!


{C7A202}
[Kid]
Daaad! Daaaaaaad!


112 :
Takeshi... opened his eyes...

At the bottom of the seabed... under unbearable
pressure...

He regained consciousness.

How many minutes had it been since he last
breathed?

But he was undeniably alive.

He had revived...


113 :
'I...'

'I'm not going to die!'

'I promised her...!'

I could hear the screams of his mind in my
ears.


114 :
Takeshi flipped himself over, kicked off
the reef, and began to swim.

He cut the water with his arms and kicked
with his legs, continuing to swim wildly
through the water.

The water pressure did not faze him, and his
body felt no resistance. He moved forward in
the darkness as if he were skating on ice.

Bubbles trailed in an arc behind him.

He maintained an unthinkable speed, tearing
apart the wall of water in front of him. His
only source of guidance was a faint light
visible ahead.


115 :
‡LSplash!

His momentum carried him flying out of the
water.

Putting his face above the pool, he started
coughing hard, trying to expel all of the
seawater in his lungs.

He clung to the edge of the pool.

Sucking in deep breaths of air.

He coughed hard as he was breathing in and
vomited a large amount of water.

He repeated that many times.

When the painful fits had finally died down,
Takeshi lay exhausted, like he was dead.

Truth be told, he probably had been dead...


Takeshi crawled across the floor.


He flipped over on his back with a thud.

He couldn't move...

The sound of his heavy breathing echoed off
of the walls.


{C7A203}
[Kid]
Dad! Dad! Hang in there!

Hokuto called out.


{C7A204}
[Takeshi]
Haha...

Takeshi laughed.


{C7A205}
[Takeshi]
I don't know... who the heck you are...


{C7A206}
[Takeshi]
But don't call me 'Dad'.


{C7A207}
[Kid]
Dad...


{C7A208}
[Takeshi]
I'm telling you, I don't have any kids.


{C7A209}
[Kid]
But I'm your son!


{C7A210}
[Takeshi]
Okay then, who's your mom?


{C7A211}
[Kid]
Tsugumi. Tsugumi is.


{C7A212}
[Takeshi]
Hahahahaha!


{C7A213}
[Kid]
Yeah, it’s no surprise you’re laughing.


{C7A214}
[Kid]
You probably don't believe me, do you?


{C7A215}
[Kid]
"Because... I'm talking to you from... seventeen years 
in the future..."


{C7A216}
[Takeshi]
Hmmm... Seventeen years... That'd make it 2034...


{C7A217}
[Takeshi]
"By the way, where are you? I can't see 
you... anywhere..."


{C7A218}
[Kid]
I'm close by you.


116 :
Takeshi peeled himself off the floor where
he'd been lying and rose slowly.

He looked all around.


{C7A219}
[Kid]
"Even if you look for me, I don't think you 
can see me."


{C7A220}
[Kid]
I'm only looking at you, Dad.


{C7A221}
[Takeshi]
What are you talking about...?


{C7A222}
[Kid]
My body isn't in your time.


{C7A223}
[Kid]
"And it isn't like I'm using a speaker to 
send my words to you."


{C7A224}
[Kid]
I'm connected to your mind, talking to you.

Takeshi put his finger in his ear and wiggled
it.


117 :

{C7A225}
[Takeshi]
"I must be hallucinating this. I wonder if 
I'm..."


{C7A226}
[Kid]
No!


{C7A227}
[Kid]
You don't have time for this!


{C7A228}
[Kid]
We don't have time to waste!


118 :

{C7A229}
[Takeshi]
"Oh yeah, you mentioned earlier about £o¢o in 
the research facility, right?"


{C7A230}
[Kid]
That's right.


{C7A231}
[Kid]
"£o¢o didn't get out in one of the 
submersibles."


{C7A232}
[Kid]
"The man from the rescue squad who told you 
about the survivors... He was talking about 
Y¤u, Kaburaki, and... the researcher."


119 :

{C7A233}
[Takeshi]
You've got to be joking...?


{C7A234}
[Kid]
"You've got to go back and check the research 
facility one more time."


{C7A235}
[Kid]
£o¢o's still in there.


120 :
Takeshi hurried down the corridor.

The research facility was almost entirely
silent.

The only sound was the echo of Takeshi's shoes
against the floor.

The corridor wound left and right. He searched
around but didn't find any signs of anyone.


121 :

{C7A236}
[Takeshi]
Hey, I don't see anyone...


{C7A237}
[Kid]
That's impossible!


{C7A238}
[Kid]
"I'm telling you she's got to be there 
somewhere!"

Takeshi tilted his head a bit, quizzically.


122 :

{C7A239}
[Takeshi]
Well, I suppose I should thank you.


{C7A240}
[Takeshi]
"If you hadn't woken me up saying something 
stupid like 'Dad!'..."


{C7A241}
[Takeshi]
I probably would have drowned...


{C7A242}
[Kid]
Are you alright?


123 :

{C7A243}
[Takeshi]
What do you think!?


{C7A244}
[Takeshi]
"Just think about everything that's 
happened to me in the last few hours, will 
you!?"


{C7A245}
[Takeshi]
"It started with getting Tief Blau, I got 
decompressed, pressurized, and pumped up 
with Tsugumi's antibodies..."


{C7A246}
[Takeshi]
"And finally ended with getting sucked out to 
the bottom of the sea... and practically 
drowning..."


124 :

{C7A247}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I guess I DID kind of throw myself out 
there..."


{C7A248}
[Kid]
"In spite of all that... you seem to be doing 
alright to me..."


125 :
[Takeshi]
.........

[Kid]
.........


{C7A249}
[Takeshi]
"W-well, I suppose... Tsugumi's antibodies 
must've kicked in."

Or maybe...

The effects of the Curé virus had already
started.

No, there was no way his DNA could be
rewritten so quickly...

But that might have been another explanation for
why Takeshi recovered so quickly from jumping
into the water...

I had no way of knowing.

It didn't matter, though. He looked a lot
better after walking around for a while.

He looked strong, even.

Takeshi walked down the passageway on steady
legs.


126 :
He came to an intersection.

Checking quickly to the left and right, he
set down the path to the left.

It was right after that.


127 :

{C7A250}
[Takeshi]
Wait a sec...


{C7A251}
[Takeshi]
Did something just... move right now?

Without waiting for Hokuto's reply, Takeshi
started running.


128 :

{C7A252}
[Takeshi]
£-£o¢o!

£o¢o had fallen down in the corridor.


129 :
Takeshi rushed over to £o¢o and lifted up her
motionless body.


130 :

{C7A253}
[£o¢o]
Ta-Takepyon...

£o¢o spoke faintly.


{C7A254}
[Takeshi]
What... What are you doing here...!?


{C7A255}
[£o¢o]
"Umm... Well... Pipi wasn't, um... I couldn't 
find him, and..."


{C7A256}
[£o¢o]
So I went... looking for him...

It appeared that £o¢o had gotten out of the
pod by herself, before the rescue squad had
arrived, and gone off looking for Pipi.


{C7A257}
[Takeshi]
You are the most... totally... totally...

Takeshi shook his head, dumbfounded.

£o¢o looked innocently at the exasperated
Takeshi and muttered...


{C7A258}
[£o¢o]
Hey...?


{C7A259}
[£o¢o]
...Is everyone else...


{C7A260}
[£o¢o]
...Still... sleeping...?


131 :
That was all £o¢o could say before she passed
out.

The next instant...


132 :
‡LBOOOOOooooM!


133 :
A loud explosion shook the walls of IBF.

The sound came from up above.

The falling wreckage from LeMU had probably
collided with the roof of the research
facility.

Paradise was still collapsing, it seemed.

Takeshi quickly scooped up £o¢o's body and
dashed across the floor.
