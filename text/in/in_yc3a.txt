1 :
In that world, where the boundaries between
light and shadow blended, there was no sound.

The motion of white waves of darkness surged
forward, permeating my skin and shaking my
whole body.

Something... like a hard shell beginning to
resonate and emit a black light from inside.

There was no sign that the waves would stop.

Rather, they seemed to be getting stronger and
stronger.

A crack ran down the outer husk.

It began to spread like the strands of a web
and soon covered the entire shell.

Pieces began to fall away.

Dropping... to the floor...

What I got a glimpse of through the fragmented
shell... was dazzling...

The particles of light filling that white space
began to converge on each other.

The light formed a vague image.

The image came flying into view...

A fragment of a scene familiar to me.


2 :
I woke up in the middle of the conference room.

[Takeshi]
‡LEh!?

[Takeshi]
'Me'!?

Why did I feel such unease toward 'me'?

If you stared at something for a long time, it
could seem to warp and change...

The unnaturalness I felt right then seemed a
lot like that phenomenon.

As though I was taking something for granted
that I shouldn't.

It was probably just my mind playing tricks
on me.

And not thinking any more of it... I shook
£o¢o's shoulder. She was asleep next to
me, head down on the table.

[Takeshi]
Hey, get up. It's morning.


3 :

{T3A013}
[£o¢o]
Funyuu... Hmmmmm...

Rubbing her eyes, £o¢o got up slowly.


4 :

{T3A014}
[£o¢o]
Oh, good morning... onii-chan...

[Takeshi]
...Huh? Onii-chan?

[Takeshi]
"Oh, I see. You have a brother, £o¢o? But I'm
not your brother..."


{T3A015}
[£o¢o]
No... Onii-chan...


{T3A016}
[£o¢o]
"We need to get ready, or we'll be late for 
school..."

£o¢o was still half in dreamland.

[Takeshi]
Late for school?

[Takeshi]
What are you talking about?


{T3A017}
[£o¢o]
Well, that's just the setting it is...

[Takeshi]
Uh, listen...

[Takeshi]
Stop messing around, we're going to eat.


5 :

{T3A018}
[£o¢o]
Ah... Okay, Takepyon.


6 :
When £o¢o and I made it to the kiosk,
everyone had gathered there.

Tsugumi, Sora, Y¤u, and the Kid... all of them.

I made my way into the submarine and opened
up the refrigerator.


[Takeshi]
Oh!

I spotted sausages hidden in the back.

I decided to make everyone hotdogs.

Soon after I'd made breakfast for everyone, I
leaned out over the counter and said...

[Takeshi]
Alright, whoever wants to eat, get in line!


7 :

{T3A027}
[£o¢o]
I'm first!

[Takeshi]
Oh!? Well, here ya go.


8 :

{T3A028}
[£o¢o]
Thank you~


9 :
[Takeshi]
Help yourself to ketchup and mustard.


10 :

{T3A029}
[Kid]
Uh, I'd like one too...


11 :

{T3A030}
[Y¤u]
Hey, wait in line! The next person is M-E-!


12 :
That was probably the way things usually were
at the shop.

There still wasn't any schedule as to when we
might get out of LeMU.

But in the meantime, we'd stopped thinking
about the difficult and negative things.


13 :

{T3A031}
[Kid]
"I'm not sure why, but you look like you're 
having fun."

[Takeshi]
Who, me? You think so? Fun... I guess, maybe...

14 :

{T3A032}
[£o¢o]
"Yeah, you look like you might even be enjoying
your life here."


15 :
[Takeshi]
"I wonder how that'd feel... I guess it'd be 
kind of fun, owning a stand like this!"


16 :

{T3A033}
[Kid]
Owning... a stand...


{T3A034}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you really do look like you work 
here."

[Takeshi]
"Hotdogs, get your hotdogs! They're on the 
house!"


{T3A035}
[£o¢o]
"You don't think that maybe you could have 
sold hotdogs in a past life?"

[Takeshi]
Aw shucks, dear customer, you're just sayin' that...


17 :

{T3A036}
[Y¤u]
"No, £o¢o. I don't think he was a hotdog man, 
I think he was..."


18 :

{T3A037}
[Y¤u]
...A sandwich man?

[Takeshi]
Ah, come on, Y¤u!


19 :

{T3A038}
[Y¤u]
Ahahahaha...


20 :
The three of them took their hotdogs and
walked a short distance from the stand,
laughing.

And as if they had traded places, Tsugumi
came up.


21 :

{T3A047}
[Tsugumi]
What just happened?

[Takeshi]
"Ah, everyone was eating hotdogs. Hey, I've 
got one for you too."

[Tsugumi]
.........


22 :
Tsugumi took it without a word of thanks and
went to the corner of the room.

Sora was talking with the Kid.

I was a bit sad that I couldn't make anything
for her.

Still leaning over, I greedily stuffed my own
hotdog into my mouth and watched everyone from
where I was.

It was May 3rd‡L

It had been three days since we'd been trapped.

But everyone was bright and showed no
feeling of fatigue or sadness.

Especially £o¢o‡L

It was hard to believe that she had suffered
so much that first night.

For no reason, £o¢o was playing with Pipi's
tail.

Looking at her smiling face, I suddenly
remembered how we had bumped into each other
again.

After I got her out of the elevator, I seemed
to remember...


23 :

{C1T024}
[£o¢o]
Ah!

[Takeshi]
Ah!


{C1T025}
[£o¢o]
You're that guy from before!

[Takeshi]
You're that girl from before!

The girl and I pointed at each other and froze.



{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*!

I spotted the scruffy face of a dog circling
around her feet.

[Takeshi]
Popo...


{C1T026}
[£o¢o]
His name's not 'Popo'...


{C1T027}
[£o¢o]
"This little guy's name is Pipi, and my name's 
£o¢o... Try not to mix them up, okay?"

[Takeshi]
But... what are you doing here?


{C1T028}
[£o¢o]
Well, what do you expect me to say to that...?


{C1T029}
[£o¢o]
"I was trying to go to one of the lower 
levels, and all of a sudden this escalator 
stopped, and..."

[Takeshi]
"It isn't an escalator, it's an elevator, 
alright?"


{C1T030}
[£o¢o]
Haha, oops... I mean evelator, okay?

[Takeshi]
No, NOT e-ve-lator, E-LE-VA-TOR.

[Takeshi]
"If you're on a moving staircase, that's 
called an escalator, and if you're in a box 
that goes up and down, that's an 
elevator... Try not to mix them up."

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


{C1T031}
[£o¢o]
Does it really matter?


{C1T032}
[£o¢o]
"Anyway, I don't know why, but all of a 
sudden I was trapped in this box."

[Takeshi]
Really...


{C1T033}
[£o¢o]
Hey?

[Takeshi]
Hmmm?


{C1T034}
[£o¢o]
I'd kind of like to get out of here... soon...

[Takeshi]
Oh, aah, I'm sorry.

I said that and got down on my stomach from
atop the elevator.

I leaned down from the small hole and stuck
my hand out to £o¢o.


{C1T035}
[£o¢o]
Please, help Pipi first.

£o¢o held Pipi up to me, stretching as far as
she could to make him reach.

I grabbed onto Pipi's front legs and pulled
him out from the hole in the ceiling.

[Takeshi]
Okay, it's your turn next, £o¢o.

I stuck out my hand again.


24 :

{C1T036}
[£o¢o]
Aia! Wah! Ayah!

£o¢o jumped over and over, reaching out for
my hand.

But... either she was too short or just
couldn't jump, because she didn't even
reach my fingertips.


25 :

{C1T044}
[£o¢o]
Toriiyaa!


26 :

{C1T045}
[£o¢o]
Uuuriya!


27 :

{C1T046}
[£o¢o]
Eeeiii!


28 :

{C1T047}
[£o¢o]
Yaah!


29 :

{C1T048}
[£o¢o]
Waachooo!


30 :
Next, I looked over to where Sora was.

She was standing next to the Kid and
talking with Tsugumi about something.

I couldn't hear what they were talking about
from where I was.

Akanegasaki Sora‡L

It was hard to believe she was only an
illusion generated by RSD...

I stared at her again from a distance.


I remembered what we'd talked about the day
before...


31 :

{C2T008}
[Sora]
By the way, Kuranari-san...


32 :

{C2T009}
[Sora]
Kuranari-san... Have you ever seen the moon?

[Takeshi]
Hahaha! Yeah, are you kidding?


33 :

{C2T010}
[Sora]
"Well, now let's say that you have seen a full 
moon."


{C2T011}
[Sora]
"And let's say that you closed your eyes. Do 
you think the moon would still be there?"

[Takeshi]
Why are you asking such obvious questions?

[Takeshi]
Of course it would.


34 :

{C2T012}
[Sora]
"And how about if everyone in the world closed 
their eyes all at the same time?"

[Takeshi]
"I don't know what your point is, but... even if 
everyone in the world closed their eyes, the 
moon wouldn't disappear."


35 :

{C2T013}
[Sora]
Really?

[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{C2T014}
[Sora]
How can you be sure?

[Takeshi]
Just open your eyes, right?


36 :

{C2T015}
[Sora]
"That goes against the purpose of this 
exercise."


{C2T016}
[Sora]
"My question was whether or not there is 
any way of verifying that the moon exists 
if someone closes their eyes."


{C2T017}
[Sora]
"When you close your eyes, do you think this 
world still exists?"


{C2T018}
[Sora]
"What if I told you that not only myself, but 
all of LeMU was nothing but an RSD-generated 
illusion... What would you do then?"


{C2T019}
[Sora]
"Can you prove that the walls, the ceiling, 
and all of the scenery that you are 
observing actually exist?"


37 :

{C2T020}
[Sora]
Haha, I'm sorry. I was only joking.

[Takeshi]
That's a joke?


{C2T021}
[Sora]
Yes, LeMU really does exist.


{C2T022}
[Sora]
"You sounded so full of confidence when you 
answered... I thought I would tease you just 
a bit."


38 :

{C2T023}
[Sora]
However, I can say this.


{C2T024}
[Sora]
"For humans to know the world around them, 
they must use one of their five senses."


{C2T025}
[Sora]
"If they lose all of these, they lose the 
ability to tell whether this world exists 
or not."


39 :

{C2T026}
[Sora]
"Another way of putting it might be to say 
that the perspective is in the eye of the 
beholder."


{C2T027}
[Sora]
"In this instance, I don't mean just sight, 
but hearing, smell, taste, and touch as well. All of 
the senses."


{C2T028}
[Sora]
"The point at which we perceive the world‡Lthat 
is perspective."


40 :

{C2T029}
[Sora]
And I...


41 :

{C2T030}
[Sora]
I... I am the same as the moon.


42 :
Her existence disappeared when I closed my
eyes...

But I felt that Sora had just as much as, no,
maybe even more human warmth and caring than
the rest of us.

Then again, there was Tsugumi's coldness...


43 :

{T1C121}
[Tsugumi]
"Hmmm...? I guess you're not as dumb as you 
look."

[Takeshi]
What do you mean by that?


{T1C122}
[Tsugumi]
I mean exactly what I said.


{T1C123}
[Tsugumi]
You don't look that smart.

[Takeshi]
.........


44 :

{T1C124}
[Tsugumi]
This is a trap.


{T1C125}
[Tsugumi]
And you probably aren't going to get out.


{T1C126}
[Tsugumi]
"No, not just you, but everyone else as well.
All four of them."


{T1C127}
[Tsugumi]
You're all the same.

[Takeshi]
Well, what about you then, Tsugumi?


45 :

{T1C128}
[Tsugumi]
I...


46 :

{T1C129}
[Tsugumi]
"Yeah. I suppose I could die in a place like 
this."


{T1C130}
[Tsugumi]
It wouldn't be bad at all, I guess.


47 :
I couldn't forget the cold smile that she had
on her face as she said those words.

I was thinking that and looking at her. I
wasn't sure if she could feel my gaze, but
she turned to look over at me.

For some reason, I felt like she could see
what I was thinking, and I avoided her eyes.

The next person to jump into my field of view
was Y¤u.

Y¤u had finished eating her hotdog and was
dancing hand in hand with £o¢o.

I wondered if it was some kind of folk dance.

She smiled so widely that it seemed like her face
might split, and she laughed boisterously.

Her eyes shone so brightly...

But I knew...

There was a sad past hidden behind those
eyes...

Her father had disappeared seventeen years
earlier.

I thought about the talk I'd had with Y¤u the
day before.

Maybe the reason she carried that album
around with her was that she wanted something
to connect her with the memories of her father.


48 :
I'd bumped into Y¤u and £o¢o in front of the
Lemurian Ruins the previous day (May 2nd).

In the palm of Y¤u's hand was... some kind of
journal or notebook. She had it opened and
was staring at a page.

£o¢o was standing next to her, peering
over her shoulder.

[Takeshi]
What'cha looking at?


49 :

{C2T032}
[£o¢o]
"Um, uh, we were, um, looking at these 
pictures."

[Takeshi]
Pictures?


{C2T033}
[Y¤u]
You want to see them?

[Takeshi]
Sure.


{C2T034}
[Y¤u]
Okay, I'll show you.


50 :
What Y¤u handed over to me was neither a
journal nor notebook, but a single file.

One small enough to fit in the palm of my hand.

It was already open, and it had several pictures
taken from an instant camera stuffed between
the pages.

They were baby pictures.

[Takeshi]
It can't be...

[Takeshi]
Your baby!?


51 :

{C2T035}
[Y¤u]
Nooo, stupid!


52 :

{C2T036}
[Y¤u]
I'm eighteen, okay? And I'm single. Single!

[Takeshi]
Yeah right...

[Takeshi]
Which means that this baby is...?


53 :

{C2T037}
[£o¢o]
It's Nakkyu, dummy.


{C2T038}
[£o¢o]
"These are from when Nakkyu was a little bitty 
baby!"

[Takeshi]
So this is what you were laughing about?


{C2T039}
[Y¤u]
Something wrong with that?


54 :

{C2T040}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, they're adorable, right? My baby 
pictures."


{C2T041}
[Y¤u]
"Uh, and of course the fact that I'm cute 
hasn't changed a bit, you know."

[Takeshi]
.........


55 :

{C2T042}
[Y¤u]
Oh, and... um... can you hand those back?

And saying that, Y¤u snatched the file out of
my hands...


56 :

{C2T043}
[Y¤u]
"This picture is from when I was dressed up 
in a kimono as a kid..."


{C2T044}
[Y¤u]
"And in this, I was head cheerleader for an 
athletic event at school."


{C2T045}
[Y¤u]
"And... Oh, this one's from my first day of 
middle school."

Y¤u continued to flip through the pages.


57 :

{C2T046}
[Y¤u]
"And here's one that I took at the talent 
show my freshman year in high school."


{C2T047}
[Y¤u]
"Here's Keiko, Min-min, Betty, Chi-chan, Beef 
Yamamoto... Oh, and I couldn't forget my 
teacher, right?"


{C2T048}
[Y¤u]
"And the fireworks festival... Here's my 
trip to the hot springs... Oh! And one from 
that time I stayed at Ami-chan's!"


58 :

{C2T049}
[Y¤u]
And here we have... Huh? What is this?


59 :

{C2T050}
[Y¤u]
"Oooh, that's riiight. This is when we 
sneaked into school that one night..."


{C2T051}
[Y¤u]
"And of course, the graduation ceremony... 
There was one more... Uuummm..."


60 :

{C2T052}
[Y¤u]
"Here it is, heh heh. It's hideous, right? 
I'd been crying and crying..."

So much of Y¤u's history was there...

Smiling faces, sad faces, silly faces,
surprised faces, even shy faces...

There were girlfriends, boyfriends, teachers,
people, afternoons, nights, good times, and
hard times...

It went without saying, but shown in those
photos were people I didn't know, places I
didn't know, and a Y¤u that I didn't know.


{C2T053}
[Y¤u]
Oh, and, and...

Y¤u looked like she had no intention of
stopping, so I rushed to get a word in.

[Takeshi]
"Um, Y¤u? So what is this, your life's 
history album or something?"


61 :

{C2T054}
[Y¤u]
"A history album... Well, I've never called 
it that before..."


{C2T055}
[Y¤u]
"But if you had to label it, I guess you 
could call it that."

[Takeshi]
Uh, so why are you carrying that with you?


{C2T056}
[Y¤u]
Huh? Why do you even need to ask?


62 :

{C2T057}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you don't know? All girls carry 
around things like this. It's normal."

[Takeshi]
You don't say?


63 :

{C2T058}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.


{C2T059}
[£o¢o]
Well, all the girls I know carry them around.


64 :

{C2T060}
[Y¤u]
"I wonder what everyone is doing right about 
now..."

Y¤u murmured softly to herself as she flipped
through the pages.


{C2T061}
[Y¤u]
Do any of these people ever worry about me?


65 :

{C2T062}
[£o¢o]
Oh yeah...


{C2T063}
[£o¢o]
Do you live with your mom and dad, Takepyon?


{C2T064}
[£o¢o]
Or do you live by yourself?

£o¢o threw the question at me abruptly.

Before answering, I tossed the question back.

[Takeshi]
"How about you, £o¢o? You're probably still 
living with your parents, aren't you?"


66 :

{C2T070}
[£o¢o]
Well, I'm fourteen, aren't I? Of course I am.


67 :

{C2T071}
[£o¢o]
"Ah, well, right now my dad isn't at home, 
but..."

[Takeshi]
Hmm? Why not?


68 :

{C2T072}
[£o¢o]
"Because he's on a 'business trip', that's 
why."

[Takeshi]
Oh, I see.

[Takeshi]
"And what about you, Y¤u? Are you living with 
your parents, or..."

(Oh! Duh! Why did I ask that!?)‡LI realized
it'd been a mistake to ask that.

Y¤u's dad was missing.

But it didn't seem as if she cared one way or
another.


{C2T073}
[Y¤u]
I'm living with my mom.


{C2T074}
[Y¤u]
But I doubt she's really worried about me.


{C2T075}
[Y¤u]
"That's just the kind of person she is, my 
mom..."

[Takeshi]
What do you mean?


{C2T076}
[Y¤u]
"I guess you could call her a positive 
thinker... She isn't the type to really let 
herself get caught up in things."


{C2T077}
[Y¤u]
She doesn't care if I stay out all night...


{C2T078}
[Y¤u]
"I've been living with her for eighteen years... but 
she's never raised her voice at me once."


{C2T079}
[Y¤u]
"I grew up pretty much doing whatever I 
wanted."


{C2T080}
[Y¤u]
"I suppose that's why I turned out the way I 
did."

Y¤u showed me a page from her album that she'd
turned to.

There was Y¤u, putting the hurt on some
wrestler.

And the guy looked like a bulky jock of sorts.


69 :
Coming out of my reverie, I noticed the
scene had changed a bit.

Y¤u and the Kid had taken off somewhere.

Maybe they'd gone to the rest area next door.

[Takeshi]
"It's only been two days, and so much 
has happened..."

[Takeshi]
"Just being trapped here is an unusual state 
of affairs..."

I said those words to myself without thinking.

‡LJust then!


70 :
Boooom...

BOOOOooooooom...

BOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooom...

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM...

BAM.


71 :
‡LBABOOOOMM!

Suddenly, a low metallic sound reverberated
throughout the complex.

It was a dull, muffled sound.


72 :
[Takeshi]
Wh-what was that!?


73 :

{T3A061}
[Tsugumi]
This whole place just shook... a little.


74 :

{C3A001}
[£o¢o]
Sora-san! Sora-san!


75 :
£o¢o ran over to Sora.

Pipi was clutched to her chest...

£o¢o was hugging him so hard, he seemed about
to rupture.


76 :

{C3A003}
[£o¢o]
"Hey, did something just happen? There was an 
awful sound just now."


{C3A004}
[Sora]
"One of the shafts that supports this floor 
has started to warp."


{C3A005}
[Sora]
"It appears as if the ocean currents may have 
caused it."

[Takeshi]
How dangerous are we talking here?


77 :

{T3A071}
[Sora]
"Well it should be within the margin of error, 
but... No, wait a second."


78 :

{C3A007}
[Sora]
"There is an anomaly in one of the 
pressure-regulating pipes at Zweiter 
Stock's warehouse."

[Takeshi]
What are pressure-regulating pipes?


{C3A008}
[Sora]
"These pipelines are responsible for adjusting 
the pressure inside the multi-layered 
bulkheads comprising LeMU."


{C3A009}
[Sora]
"If any of them should rupture, for whatever 
reason, I am incapable of repairing them."


{C3A010}
[Sora]
"The anomaly is only slight, so you shouldn't have to
hurry, but... I think it is best if someone goes to check
on it."


{C3A011}
[Sora]
Would you please go for me?

[Takeshi]
Sure, leave it to me.


79 :

{T3A076}
[Tsugumi]
I'll go too.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi? You sure?


80 :

{T3A077}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, if we're going to fix something, we'll 
need tools, right? I know my way around a 
workshop."

[Takeshi]
Alright... Let's go.


81 :

{C3A015}
[£o¢o]
I'll help too!


{PIPI_00}
[Pipi]
*Woof*

[Takeshi]
Okay, you can come too, £o¢o...


82 :
[Takeshi]
"By the way, does anyone know where Y¤u and 
the Kid went?"


83 :

{C3A016}
[Sora]
Tanaka-san and Kid-san are in the security office.

[Takeshi]
What the heck are they doing there...?


{C3A017}
[Sora]
They are trying to make contact with LeMMIH.

[Takeshi]
With LeMMIH...?

[Takeshi]
"What am I thinking? I've got other things to 
worry about."

[Takeshi]
"Alright, the three of us are going to the 
warehouse..."

[Takeshi]
"Sora? Give Y¤u and the Kid an update on the 
situation, will you?"


{C3A018}
[Sora]
Understood.


84 :
We opened up the door to the storage room to
find the floor covered in water.

The water level came up to the tops of my
shoes.

We could hear a hissing sound coming from
somewhere in the back of the room.

The sound drew our attention.

There was a faint crack in the
pressure-regulating pipe, and water was
dancing out of it in a fine mist.

If that was all it was, it didn't seem like we
had anything to worry about.

It seemed like we'd be able to fix it in no
time.

Tsugumi had opened up the toolbox that was in
the corner of the room and started spreading
a few tools out in front of her.

[Takeshi]
What should I do?


85 :

{T3A116}
[Tsugumi]
"The pipe is bent a little bit... I'm going to 
clamp a metal sleeve on it. Would you support 
the pipe for me?"

[Takeshi]
Roger that!


86 :

{C3A020}
[£o¢o]
What should I do?


87 :

{T3A118}
[Tsugumi]
"On the other side of this... there should be 
a valve attached to this pipe. You see it? I 
want you to loosen that a bit."


88 :

{C3A022}
[£o¢o]
Okaaaay, gotcha!


89 :
In that way, the three of us started working
in unison.

We opened and closed a number of valves,
connected and repaired pipes, and welded shut
cracks...


90 :
.........

......

...


91 :

{T3A125}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi? Don't just stand there. On to the 
next pipe."

[Takeshi]
Huh? Oh, okay.


92 :

{T3A126}
[Tsugumi]
First, take that blue valve and...


{T3A127}
[Tsugumi]
Now twist the red valve...


93 :
We'd fixed a number of pipes, but the sound of
escaping steam still hadn't stopped.


94 :

{T3A128}
[Tsugumi]
Alright, £o¢o, wait just a bit.


95 :

{C3A027}
[£o¢o]
Okay, I'm ready~


96 :

{T3A130}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, turn the valves in the order I told 
you."

[Takeshi]
.........


97 :

{T3A131}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, Takeshi, are you listening?

[Takeshi]
"Huh? Yeah, alright, alright. I'm sorry. Blue, 
then red, right?"


98 :

{T3A132}
[Tsugumi]
Yeah. Loosen them, then shut them again.


99 :
I set to work on the blue valve in front of me.


I was supposed to loosen it...

I was supposed to turn it counterclockwise,
yeah...

I turned the blue valve with all of my
strength.


100 :
The sound of rushing steam grew softer.

Next, close the red valve...

The strength of the steam blowing from the pipe
weakened.

(Alright, that does it.)

[Takeshi]
Okay!


101 :

{T3A133}
[Tsugumi]
£o¢o, hold on just a little longer.


{C3A032}
[£o¢o]
Okay.


102 :
Holding up her left hand to shield her face,
Tsugumi operated the welding torch with her
right hand.

The crack in the pipe closed visibly.


103 :

{T3A138}
[Tsugumi]
"Takeshi, after I've finished attaching this, 
return the valve to its original position 
right away."

[Takeshi]
Okay.

Tsugumi finished welding.


104 :

{T3A139}
[Tsugumi]
The valve! Hurry!

[Takeshi]
Alright! Geez!


105 :
I quickly turned the valve back in the other
direction.

I could feel the steam flowing through the
valve.


106 :

{T3A140}
[Tsugumi]
"£o¢o, this pipe's done. Go on to the next 
one."


{C3A036}
[£o¢o]
Okay, where is it?


107 :

{T3A142}
[Tsugumi]
Hmmm... Hold on just a second.


108 :
The water underfoot still hadn't gone down at
all and was swirling around like a whirlpool.

The air conditioner on the wall was sucking
in water and gurgling it out.

It appeared it had also shorted out.

I could see blue-white sparks jumping around
inside.

I hoped it didn't shock me...


109 :
‡LAs soon as I thought that!


110 :
‡LBam!

It sounded like the air conditioner was about
to break apart.


111 :
Smoke started pouring out from the exhaust
vent.

And from the intake port, murky water started
gurgling out.

The area around my legs was quickly getting
grimy.


112 :

{C3A038}
[Tsugumi]
Water...


{C3A039}
[Tsugumi]
"The water that was in the suction pipe is 
starting to backflow. Be careful."


113 :
[Takeshi]
Wagh!

My leg got caught up in the jet of muddy
water, and I lost my balance.

I reached out to grab something...

I caught onto a stack of crates and old
containers lying nearby.

GR-OOAAN.

It made an ominous sound.

My body draped awkwardly over the containers.

I lifted my gaze.

The top of the stack was wobbling precariously.


114 :
I looked to Tsugumi.

Our eyes met. She was frozen in place,
holding her breath.


115 :
I shot a glance over at £o¢o.

She had her back turned to me and was
grabbing onto a pipe.

I looked up at the ceiling again.


116 :
It all happened in an instant...

The containers, having lost their balance,
started to rain down.

Chunks of metal... rusted pipes... thick iron
cylinders...

There was no sound. I perceived everything in
vivid slow motion.

Countless pieces of metal, all pouring down
quietly.

Although my mind was spinning, my body
couldn't catch up.

I couldn't talk. I couldn't move.

Crashing metal.

A raging monster...

With its sight fixed on that small frame...

Pouncing, devouring.

All of it headed‡L

For‡L


{C3A040}
[Tsugumi]
£o-£o¢o!

[Takeshi]
£O£OOO!


117 :

{C3A041}
[£o¢o]
Huh?


118 :
The sight that flashed before me...

Was a mountain of metal.

The old pipes broke apart into thousands of
pieces.

The containers splintered apart, their sharp
corners flashing.

I landed in the water‡LI'd thrown myself out
of the way, arms and legs flailing.

The pipes on the wall were cracked.

They had been damaged from the shock...

And out of the cracks, water was gushing out.

And fallen nearby was...

Was...


119 :
[Takeshi]
Tsugumi!

I ran over to her.

£o¢o looked around at the spectacle and
hugged Pipi to herself tightly, her hands
trembling.

Yes... I had seen it all...

Just before the metallic objects had crashed
down on £o¢o's back, Tsugumi had thrust her
out of the way.

She'd protected her... while risking her own
life...


{C3A042}
[Tsugumi]
Agh...

A metal shard had dug deeply into Tsugumi's
right thigh.

It didn't look like she could move.


{C3A043}
[Tsugumi]
I guess I messed up.

Tsugumi grimaced and pushed down on the wound.

She was losing a lot of blood.

The murky water was getting redder by the
moment...

[Takeshi]
Hey, you okay!?


120 :

{T3A149}
[Tsugumi]
Heh heh. Does this LOOK okay to you?


121 :

{T3A150}
[Tsugumi]
Always asking stupid questions.

[Takeshi]
"S-stop laughing! I'm going to get that stuff 
off you, just wait!"

I tried to lift the metal off of her.

But no matter how hard I tried, the heavy
chunk wouldn't budge.

[Takeshi]
Damn it!


122 :

{T3A151}
[Tsugumi]
Looks like it's no use...

In the meantime, the water level had risen
from ankle to knee height.


{C3A047}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumiiin!

£o¢o started to get closer to Tsugumi.


123 :

{T3A153}
[Tsugumi]
Get away from me!

Stung by Tsugumi's cold words, £o¢o stiffened
and stopped.


124 :

{T3A154}
[Tsugumi]
Get out of here, £o¢o.


{T3A155}
[Tsugumi]
You too, Takeshi. Get out while you can...


{T3A156}
[Tsugumi]
"At this rate, this room's partitions won't 
last."


{T3A157}
[Tsugumi]
You'll both die if you stay.


{T3A158}
[Tsugumi]
So hurry...


{T3A159}
[Tsugumi]
Get out of here.

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
...St‡L

[Takeshi]
"Stupid idiot! You think I can just leave 
you!?"


125 :

{T3A160}
[Tsugumi]
"There's nothing you can do, right? I'm stuck 
here."


{T3A161}
[Tsugumi]
"And with this injury, you can't help me 
anyway‡L"

[Takeshi]
Shut up!

I roared out.

[Takeshi]
I won't let you give up on me now, damn it!

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o! What are you standing there for!?


{C3A057}
[£o¢o]
Wah! Y-yes!?

[Takeshi]
Get on that intercom and contact the others!

With all her might, £o¢o moved her trembling
legs to get closer to the intercom.


{C3A058}
[£o¢o]
"It's no use... It's broken! I pushed the 
button, but nothing happened!"

[Takeshi]
"So run up and tell the others to get over 
here!"


{C3A059}
[£o¢o]
O-okay, I'm going!

Although she looked flustered, £o¢o nodded
and ran off.

The door to the warehouse closed.

Soon, water came up to the bottom of the door.


126 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

The water continued to rise.

From her waist down, Tsugumi was almost
completely underwater.

The water level was almost over my knees.


127 :

{T3A165}
[Tsugumi]
What are you trying to prove...?


{T3A166}
[Tsugumi]
"It doesn't mean anything... Just leave. I 
don't want you here."

[Takeshi]
I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a reason.

[Takeshi]
I can't just leave you here.


128 :

{T3A167}
[Tsugumi]
Why not?

[Takeshi]
"I've taken nothing but abuse from you, and 
you still haven't thanked me properly yet."


129 :

{T3A168}
[Tsugumi]
"Oh really... Heh heh. Well, that's reason
enough, I suppose. "

Tsugumi laughed weakly.

Her lips were trembling.

The murky water was spreading.


130 :

{T3A169}
[Tsugumi]
It's gotten cold in here...

[Takeshi]
"Alright, Tsugumi... I need you to stay with me 
now."

I chose my words as carefully as possible.


131 :

{T3A170}
[Tsugumi]
I'm perfectly sane.

[Takeshi]
"You'll be okay. The wound isn't that deep, so 
don't worry."

I was lying.

Even I could tell that her wound was
life-threatening.

Tsugumi's white femur had broken through and
protruded from her flesh...


132 :

{T3A171}
[Tsugumi]
'You'll be okay'... What makes you think that?


{T3A172}
[Tsugumi]
You're the one who's crazy...

[Takeshi]
"I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I wasn't paying 
attention, and you got hurt..."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........


133 :
The water level was rising up to Tsugumi's
head.

A section of the partitioning had broken, and
seawater was rushing in.

The water was ice cold.

The water volume increased mercilessly.

[Tsugumi]
.........

Her face contorted with pain.

In agony, she labored for breath.

There wasn't any time.

Making up my mind, I dove into the water.

I couldn't open my eyes.

All I could do was search the bottom using my
intuition.

(...AaaaaAAAAGGGH!)

(DAMN IT!)

Using all of my strength, I heaved up the
large mass of metal sticking into Tsugumi's
leg.

Aided slightly by the buoyancy of the water,
the metal hunk moved slightly.

Tsugumi pulled her leg out at once.


134 :
I lifted my face out of the water, gulping
greedily for air.

The flooding wouldn't stop.

The water level was already above my shoulders.


135 :

{T3A173}
[Tsugumi]
You are...


{T3A174}
[Tsugumi]
Such a stubborn idiot...

[Takeshi]
Shut up, just keep quiet.

With her leg injured, there was no way
Tsugumi could swim.

Holding onto her, I headed for the exit.

But the door was already underwater.


136 :

{T3A175}
[Tsugumi]
Look, there's no way you can save me...

[Takeshi]
I told you to keep quiet!

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"There's got to be another exit. I'll look 
for it."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
It'll be okay. We'll find a way out of this.


137 :

{T3A176}
[Tsugumi]
"There you go again, saying 'it'll be 
okay'... You're so irresponsible..."

[Takeshi]
Would you keep quiet!?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
.........

I probably could have forced open the door if
I had tried, but it would have put the second
floor in danger of flooding.

I searched desperately for an emergency exit.

My legs wouldn't touch the floor.

I could hardly breathe.

I was at my limit.

[Takeshi]
Ah!

[Takeshi]
"There's a ladder! In the corner of the room, 
there's a ladder. We can use it to get to the 
emergency passage."

[Takeshi]
We're going to make it, Tsugumi!!


138 :
I burst into the infirmary.

I set the injured Tsugumi down on the bed.

She was no longer conscious.

She'd lost so much blood...

We had to take emergency measures immediately.

[Takeshi]
Hey, what are we going to do!?


139 :

{C3A072}
[Y¤u]
Get out of the way!

Y¤u, who'd been waiting in the room, pushed
me aside.


140 :
A tourniquet was taken out from a rack of
medical instruments on the wall and fastened
around Tsugumi's thigh.


{C3A073}
[Y¤u]
This is bad...

[Takeshi]
What's the status? How bad is it?

[Takeshi]
Can't we use that scanner to check it out?

I pointed to the L-MRI.


141 :

{C3A074}
[Y¤u]
It doesn't work.


{C3A075}
[Y¤u]
Sora already told us, it's broken!

[Takeshi]
Oh... Yeah...


142 :
[Takeshi]
Well, what can we do...? What are we...


143 :

{C3A076}
[Sora]
I'll have a look.


144 :
Sora put her hand on Tsugumi. A holographic
window appeared in the air.

A small sensor or camera started moving on
the ceiling.


145 :

{C3A077}
[Sora]
"Well, this is just a bio scan, so I can't 
tell for certain, but..."


{C3A078}
[Sora]
"Her femur is fractured. And it looks like it 
might be a complex fracture."


{C3A079}
[Sora]
"That, and the artery is severed. She'll need 
sutures."


146 :

{C3A080}
[Y¤u]
"I've stitched up my finger before. It was 
with a survival kit, but..."


147 :

{C3A081}
[Sora]
"Well, Tanaka-san, do you think you can
assist me?"


{C3A082}
[Y¤u]
I'll do my best! Do we have anesthetic?


{C3A083}
[Sora]
"I'll get it ready. The laser scalpel, 
forceps, and sutures... Everything we need is 
already in the room."


148 :
Sora moved the electric wagon and used its
robotic arm to gather the necessary surgical
tools.

Y¤u flipped up Tsugumi's skirt and fearlessly
plunged her hand into the wound.


149 :

{C3A084}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari!


{C3A085}
[Y¤u]
You're in the way!

Y¤u pointed angrily at the exit.

[Takeshi]
Uh, yeah, sorry... Take care of her, okay!?


150 :

{C3A086}
[Y¤u]
Leave it to me!

Y¤u looked determined to show us all what she
was capable of.


151 :
As soon as I left the tense atmosphere of the
emergency room, my fatigue hit me.

[Takeshi]
*Sigh*...

I set myself down on a nearby chair.


152 :

{C3A087}
[£o¢o]
Is Tsugumin going to be...?

£o¢o was gripping Pipi but looked as if
she was having a hard time relaxing.

[Takeshi]
"You let them know right away, so... she should 
be fine."


153 :

{C3A088}
[£o¢o]
Really...?

£o¢o's eyes were moist.

It was hard to tell, but she had probably
been crying moments earlier.

Even still, she tried to smile.


{C3A089}
[£o¢o]
Hey, you think Tsugumin's...


{C3A090}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin's... gonna be okay, right?

Still looking worried, she tilted her head as
she asked me.

[Takeshi]
Yeah. She'll be fine.

[Takeshi]
Absolutely fine...


154 :
£o¢o put her head on my shoulder.

I held £o¢o close and patted her head softly.


{C3A091}
[£o¢o]
She's going to be okay, right? Right?

Her body trembling, she asked me that over
and over.

I thought maybe she had been trying not to
cry until that moment.

£o¢o, head pressed against my chest, started
crying.


{C3A092}
[£o¢o]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah...


{C3A093}
[£o¢o]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah...


155 :

{C3A094}
[???]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah...


{C3A095}
[???]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah...


{C3A096}
[???]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah...


156 :

{C3A097}
[Sara]
...Huh?


157 :

{C3A098}
[Sara]
Kid, what are you crying about?

[Kid]
.........Huh?


{C3A099}
[Sara]
Did someone pick on you?

[Kid]
.........


158 :

{C3A100}
[Sara]
I know. It's Takeshi, isn't it?

I shook my head back and forth.


159 :

{C3A101}
[Sara]
So it's Nakkyu then.

I kept shaking my head.


160 :

{C3A102}
[Sara]
Alright then, Tsugumi!

Again, I shook my head back and forth.


161 :

{C3A103}
[Sara]
Eh? Well, it couldn't be... Sora!?

[Kid]
No, nobody is picking on me.


162 :

{C3A104}
[Sara]
So then why are you crying?

[Kid]
It's... It's...


163 :
I was looking wildly around in all directions.

We were in front of the emergency room.

Sara was standing right in front of me.

But I didn't see anyone else.


{C3A105}
[Sara]
Hmmm?


164 :
I said nothing, but ran into the room.


165 :
No one was there...

She wasn't lying on the examination table.


166 :

{C3A106}
[Sara]
Hey, why'd you run away?

Sara's eyebrows were raised questioningly.

[Kid]
I didn't run away...

[Kid]
I just... wanted to check something, that's all...


167 :

{C3A107}
[Sara]
What?

I stood to the side of the table and slid my
hand across its surface.

There was no warmth.


168 :

{C3A078}
[Sora]
"Her femur is fractured. And it looks like it 
might be a complex fracture."


{C3A079}
[Sora]
"That, and the artery is severed. She'll need 
sutures."


{C3A082}
[Y¤u]
I'll do my best! Do we have anesthetic?


{C3A083}
[Sora]
"I'll get it ready. The laser scalpel, 
forceps, and sutures... Everything we need is 
already in the room."


{C3A084}
[Y¤u]
Kuranari!


{C3A085}
[Y¤u]
You're in the way!


169 :
All those voices jumped back and forth in my
head... Voices... Voices...

I twisted my head and turned, looking around
the inside of the emergency room.

Looking slowly.

The noise from before seemed like a dream.

Seemed?

(Haha, what am I thinking...?)

(It was only a 'dream'‡Ljust a 'dream'...)


170 :

{C3A108}
[Sara]
Hey? Tell me.


{C3A109}
[Sara]
What did you want to check?

I looked straight into Sara's eyes and
answered.

[Kid]
"I wanted to see if... it was real or a 
dream."


171 :

{C3A110}
[Sara]
What?

[Kid]
I had a terrible dream.


172 :

{C3A111}
[Sara]
What about?

[Kid]
Tsugumi hurt her leg really badly.

[Kid]
"There was flooding in the storage area, and 
when she went to fix it, a big chunk of metal 
fell on her."

[Kid]
"And then Tsugumi... Um... Her leg got trapped 
by the metal."

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
"And she got a huge gash on her right thigh, 
I could see the yellow of her fat, the red 
color of her muscle, and the white of her bone."

[Kid]
"Her blood vessels, lymph nodes, even nerve 
endings all hanging out and pulsating like rubber 
tubes."

[Kid]
"The whole area was covered in a sea of 
blood..."


173 :

{C3A112}
[Sara]
Eeeewww...


{C3A113}
[Sara]
Makes me feel sick just hearing about it.


174 :

{C3A114}
[Sara]
"How can you talk about that kind of dream so 
calmly?"

[Kid]
Well, it's not as if I WANTED to see it...


{C3A115}
[Sara]
Hmmm...


{C3A116}
[Sara]
"So that's why you decided to run in here 
all of a sudden?"


175 :

{C3A117}
[Sara]
"Well, I guess it's possible that you'd start 
bawling your head off after seeing a dream 
like that..."

[Kid]
Bawling...? Was I crying?


176 :

{C3A118}
[Sara]
"Of course you were! Like a hysteric 
three-year-old."

That was when I realized.

On my cheeks and chin, there was something
that felt cold...

There was a small drop of moisture sparkling
on my eyelash...

I hurriedly wiped away my tears.


177 :
So... I had been crying...

It had all happened while I was sleeping, so
I had no idea why I'd been crying.


178 :

{C3A119}
[Sara]
Hey, Kid?


{C3A120}
[Sara]
Something bothers me...

[Kid]
?


{C3A121}
[Sara]
"You just said... 'The warehouse started 
flooding', right?"

[Kid]
Yeah.


{C3A122}
[Sara]
That actually happened.

[Kid]
...What?


{C3A123}
[Sara]
"When you were sleeping, a pipe burst in the 
storage room and water started flooding in."

[Kid]
When I was... sleeping...?

What was that supposed to mean?

I couldn't fully grasp what was going on from
what I'd heard.

My mind froze.


179 :

{C3A124}
[Sara]
"But don't worry, okay? It got fixed without 
any hitches."

[Kid]
What about Tsugumi?

I didn't think it was possible, but I asked
anyway.


{C3A125}
[Sara]
She's fine, of course!


{C3A126}
[Sara]
She did most of the repairing.

[Kid]
Really...

For some reason, I felt relieved.

I wondered if it was because my dream had
been so real.


180 :
No, wait...

Dream...?

Why would I have a dream about the warehouse
flooding?

I was sleeping...

As though she had read my thoughts, Sara
said...


181 :

{C3A127}
[Sara]
But still, it's kind of strange, you know?


182 :

{C3A128}
[Sara]
"You didn't have an out-of-body experience, 
did you?"

She said as if she was making fun of me.

But honestly, Sara probably didn't take the
possibility seriously.

My mind was turning slowly but hadn't started
working normally again.

Something was preventing me from thinking.


183 :
[Kid]
Out-of-body experience...

[Kid]
"If I could do that, I could peep down girls' 
underwear all I wanted..."


184 :
I made a stab at a joke.

The fact that I could do so surprised me
somewhat.


185 :

{C3A129}
[Sara]
Moron.


186 :
Smack.


{C3A130}
[Sara]
"Even if you could look up somebody's skirt, 
you don't look down people's underwear!"


187 :
Smack.

Sara whacked me on the head a couple of times.


188 :
Thinking the whole situation odd, I started to
laugh.


189 :

{C3A131}
[Sara]
But you seem like you're doing better.


{C3A132}
[Sara]
"I was really worried last night that you 
were going to die or something..."


{C3A133}
[Sara]
But you seem just fine now.

[Kid]
?


190 :

{C3A134}
[Sara]
What? You don't remember?


{C3A135}
[Sara]
You fell over and were foaming at the mouth.

[Kid]
What?


{C3A136}
[Sara]
"Yeah, and you were flailing around on the 
ground like an upside down crab. Snip, snip."


{C3A137}
[Sara]
"By the time Takeshi called us all together, 
you were already like that."


{C3A138}
[Sara]
So all we could do was pick you up...


{C3A139}
[Sara]
And carry you into this infirmary.


{C3A140}
[Sara]
Got it?

[Kid]
I got... it...


{C3A141}
[Sara]
"You probably don't remember, but... it was 
really intense."


191 :

{C3A142}
[Sara]
You really had us worried there.

Sara slapped me gently on the cheek.

My head turned to the side with the force.

And from that position, I asked...

[Kid]
Hey...? Where was I passed out...?


192 :

{C3A143}
[Sara]
In the changing room, in front of the mirror.


193 :
‡LThe changing room.

It was a rectangular room... and stuck to
the back wall was a large mirror.

The bench had been returned to its original
position.

I walked up to the mirror.


194 :
I didn't recognize my face...

I didn't recognize that kid...

I touched my eyebrow with my right hand.

He touched his eyebrow with his left hand.

[Kid]
A, E, I, O, U...

The sounds that I uttered came to my ears.


The kid in the mirror mouthed the exact same
words, but of course I couldn't hear his voice.

I reached out my left hand to touch him.

He put out his right hand and did the same
thing.

My nails hit the hard surface of the glass
with a click.

But I couldn't reach him.

Looking closely, I could see a face floating
over his left shoulder.

Two pairs of eyes stared intensely at me.

It had to be an evil spirit.

Maybe he was even being possessed.

(That's so sad, he's been taken over by a
demon...)

And as soon as I said that to myself, I
realized that HE was looking at ME.


(...What...? I'm being possessed?)


195 :

{C3A144}
[Sara]
Hey.

[Kid]
Aaaah! Sa-Sa-Sa-Sara!


196 :
I jumped about three meters away, bending
backward as I leaped.

[Kid]
Wh-wh-when'd you get here!?


197 :

{C3A145}
[Sara]
Heh heh heh...


198 :

{C3A146}
[Sara]
"Tis but a simple thing to conceal the 
pitter-patter of my steps."

[Kid]
Really...

Apparently, the person who'd been looking
over my shoulder was Sara.


199 :

{C3A147}
[Sara]
Well, you just took off without saying anything.

[Kid]
So you went and followed me?


{C3A148}
[Sara]
Yeah.

Sara had grabbed onto her tied-up hair with
both hands and was swinging it back and forth.


200 :

{C3A149}
[Sara]
So? What's with the mirror?

She pointed to the mirror with the tip of her
hair.

[Kid]
Well, uh...


{C3A150}
[Sara]
Well what?


201 :
I pulled Sara by the arm to stand in
front of the mirror.


202 :
Both of our images were reflected on the
mirror's surface.

The left and right sides of her face were
reflected back in reverse, but there was no
mistaking it was her.

My face, on the other hand...

[Kid]
Hey? Who's that reflected in the mirror?


{C3A151}
[Sara]
...H-huh...? I don't understand the question.

[Kid]
This kid.

[Kid]
The kid standing next to you...

[Kid]
Who is he?


{C3A152}
[Sara]
Haah... We've started with this again, eh...?

[Kid]
Come on... I'm being serious.

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
Is this... really my face?


{C3A153}
[Sara]
"Well, if it isn't your face, whose face is 
it?"

[Kid]
Hmmm...

[Kid]
I guess you're right...

I knew the answer, but I'd still needed to
check.

That kid was... me.

The face reflected in the mirror was mine.


{C3A154}
[Sara]
Are you okay?

[Kid]
Yeah, I'm fine.

[Kid]
But I'm also not fine.


{C3A155}
[Sara]
Which one is it?

A pouting Sara was in the mirror.

I looked at her figure in the reflection.

She looked back at me.

Our gazes intersected and overlapped at the
same space and the same time.

[Kid]
I couldn't remember my own face.

[Kid]
"I couldn't remember... and I still can't
remember it."

[Kid]
"Of course, I understand that the person 
reflected in the mirror is 'me'."

[Kid]
"But... how can I say it...? It doesn't feel 
real..."


{C3A156}
[Sara]
I see.

[Kid]
"That's why I passed out in front of the 
mirror last night."

[Kid]
"The face reflecting back at me in the 
mirror felt like someone else, someone I 
didn't know..."


{C3A157}
[Sara]
Hmmm...


{C3A158}
[Sara]
"But that shouldn't be enough to make you 
foam at the mouth, don't you think?"


{C3A159}
[Sara]
"I mean, if you looked into the mirror and 
were suddenly hopelessly ugly, even I would 
faint, but..."


{C3A160}
[Sara]
Your face... isn't that bad...


{C3A161}
[Sara]
"I would think that you'd be relieved and think,
'You know, I've got a pretty nice-looking 
face.'"

Sara glanced at the mirror and took a good
look at my face.


{C3A162}
[Sara]
"I mean, if I had to say one way or the 
other, I like your face."

That said, Sara pointed the tip of her
hair at me.


{C3A163}
[Sara]
Do you want to know why?

[Kid]
.........


{C3A164}
[Sara]
I think you look a little like me.

[Kid]
...L-look like...? I look like you?

I stared intently at Sara's face.


{C3A165}
[Sara]
You don't think so?

Suddenly, a vast, whirling pattern came into
my mind.

It spun round and round, round and round,
paralyzing my ability to think.

[Kid]
I... d-don't think so.

It took all my will to mumble just that.


{C3A166}
[Sara]
Reeeally? I think our eyes look the same.

[Kid]
.........


{C3A167}
[Sara]
Hey, why are you making such a sour face?


{C3A168}
[Sara]
I'm giving you a compliment.


{C3A169}
[Sara]
"Or maybe, I guess you could say I'm giving 
myself a compliment..."

Sara started smiling shyly.

And then, all of a sudden, she tickled my nose
with the tip of her hair.

[Kid]
Hey! What're you doing!?


203 :
I jumped about three meters away, bending
backward as I leaped.

204 :

{C3A170}
[Sara]
Haha.

Sara smiled mischievously.

The smell of her hair seeped into my mind.

It was a smell somehow so familiar, almost
animal and private.
