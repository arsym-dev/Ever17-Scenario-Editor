1 :
Daybreak. The date had changed to Sunday,
May 7th.

Since that time, we hadn't slept at all.

I was starting to feel bad again.

It felt like a headache, dizziness, nausea, and
chills were seeping out from deep
in the core of my body.

I suffered from a wave of dull pain and
extreme fatigue... I was only half-conscious.

Exhaustion... I had reached my limit.

But I tried to keep my energy from being
sapped away.

Surrounded by darkness and endless fear, we
had fought our way so far...

And there was no sign that things were going
to get better.

Communication lines with the outside were
still down.

And...

We had yet to find a clue leading to possible
escape.

Slowly, Y¤u started to get ill too.

Her face was pale.

Her breathing was heavy. Beads of sweat stood
out on her forehead.

She seemed to have a terrible fever.

I was not the only one suffering mentally and
physically.

There had been signs from the day before.

But we couldn't do anything about it. The
infirmary was already underwater.

We could only endure the passing of time.

.........

.........

.........


2 :
(Is this it...?)

(Is this the end...?)

(Is giving up the only choice...?)

I looked up helplessly.

The ceiling was crusty with cigarette smoke.

I couldn't see anything else.

(I am going to die...)

(There's nothing I can do except die...)

That was my conclusion.

Haha...

Hahaha...

Ahahahahaha.

I knew then exactly how much strength
I had left.

I felt utterly... hopeless.

Useless.

Incompetent.

Yes, I would die.

And I was fine with that.

I didn't care.

Without a memory, I thought I had been the
equivalent of dead to start with...

Nothing changed. I had nothing to lose.

It was already decided.

I remembered what Tsugumi had told me, that...

I would die in seven days.

Her prediction was true...

(I don't care... This is the way it
should be...)

I relaxed and looked down.

And I saw...

...Y¤u.

She slumped back into a chair, and her
breathing looked labored.

{1}{1}{1}


{Y4A061}

{16:0x}Promise?{16:1}


{16:0x}Yeah, I promise.{16:1}


{16:4}

4 :
I suddenly felt a warmth in my fingertips. The
same warmth I'd felt from Y¤u's fingers when
I'd made the promise.

Y¤u...

Yes... If I didn't do anything,
Y¤u would die too.

No... I wouldn't let that happen!

I didn't care if I died, but Y¤u... Y¤u was...


Somehow, I had to save her.

Because I had promised.

Promised...

(How could I... How...)


5 :
.........

.........

.........

Then...


6 :
There was only a short time until the
estimated time of implosion.


7 :
The security office started shaking violently.

The complex screeched.


8 :
Alarms pierced the air with shrill warnings.


9 :

{YBD000}
[Sora]
"The partition strength limits... have been 
exceeded."


{YBD001}
[Sora]
Flooding has started on each floor.


{YBD002}
[Sora]
"Flooding has begun in Sector Four of Zweiter 
Stock... Implosion has begun in Sector Five on the 
same floor... In Sector Six..."

Sora reported the situation monotonously.

[Sora]
......

[Kid]
...What's wrong? What else?


10 :

{YBD003}
[Sora]
"No, I leave it at that... This report now 
means nothing..."


{YBD004}
[Sora]
"Flooding has started in this sector too... It 
won't be long until damage appears here."

[Kid]
I see...

[Kid]
How long do you think this will hold?


{YBD005}
[Sora]
20 to 25 minutes...


{YBD006}
[Sora]
But it could implode at any time.


11 :
The normal lighting went out, and the emergency
lighting kicked in.

I figured that the generator room was probably
damaged.


12 :

{YBD007}
[Sora]
I couldn't save you two after all...


{YBD008}
[Sora]
I am... really... truly... sorry...


{YBD009}
[Sora]
...Truly...

[Kid]
Don't be... It's not your fault.

[Kid]
I think you did a great job.

[Sora]
...


13 :
I headed over to be beside Y¤u.


14 :
[Kid]
"Y¤u, this place isn't going to hold... Let's 
go."


15 :
Y¤u was completely weakened.

She looked up powerlessly and nodded slightly.


{YBD010}
[Y¤u]
...Mmm.


16 :
I carried Y¤u on my back.


17 :

{YBD011}
[Sora]
Where are you going?

[Kid]
"I don't know... Somewhere where we can 
gain a little more time."

[Kid]
"I intend to stake our lives on the 
possibility that we'll be rescued 
until the very end."

[Kid]
"I can't think of anything to do other than 
that..."


18 :
[Kid]
"I promised her... that I would protect 
her no matter what."

[Sora]
......

[Kid]
"Where is the safest place left among 
the floors?"


{YBD012}
[Sora]
"That would be the control room on Dritter 
Stock, or..."


{YBD013}
[Sora]
"But it is only a matter of a few dozen 
minutes of difference."

[Kid]
That's enough...

I was going to leave the room... but I suddenly
stopped.

[Kid]
What are you going to do, Sora?


{YBD014}
[Sora]
"I will not be able to accompany you two 
any longer."


{YBD015}
[Sora]
"Due to flooding, image broadcasting devices 
in the complex have been significantly 
damaged."


{YBD016}
[Sora]
The places I can appear are limited.


{YBD017}
[Sora]
"But at the very least, I want to guide you 
two to the control room via my audio 
function."

[Kid]
Alright. Please do.


{YBD018}
[Sora]
Yes...


19 :
When I left the room, I found water leaking
from walls in spots.

The bulkheads squealed.


{YBD019}
[Sora]
"I will guide you... I will show you the 
route to the control room which is still 
safe..."


20 :
We went down to the third floor.

LeMU was still holding.

The estimated time of implosion that Sora had
predicted should have passed long before.

LeMU kept resisting to the end, as if Sora was
willing it to protect us.


{YBD020}
[Y¤u]
*Pant*, *pant*, *pant*...

Y¤u gasped, suffering terribly as I carried
her on my back.

[Kid]
"Be strong. Be patient. It's just a little 
farther..."

I lied.

I was a liar.

A little more patience... and then what?


There was nothing I could do.

So I lied...

...I was a big liar!


21 :
We were close to the control room...

And again... I saw it.

The vision of the little girl...


{YBD021}
[Y¤u]
...What... What's the matter...?

She stood across the corridor.

Her eyes met mine.

And then a name flashed in my mind, as clear
as a bell.

[Kid]
...£o¢o!


{YBD022}
[Sora]
Kid-san, what is the matter?

Turning on her heels, £o¢o ran off in the
other direction.

I chased after her, still carrying Y¤u.

[Kid]
£o¢oooo!


{YBD023}
[Sora]
Kid-san! Please come back! There is...!


22 :
I was chasing after her at full speed.

But the flooding and shaking ground slowed
me down.

From the beginning, it was a crazy, reckless
idea to run after her with Y¤u on my back.

...I lost sight of her.


23 :
It was a dead end in a narrow corridor,
in front of a small door.

Where was that place...?

I thought that maybe she was beyond the door.


24 :
In that instant, I glimpsed something
in my head.

It was a vague, abstract image.

I wasn't sure... but definitely...

I felt it. I could see it.

...That there should be a beam of hope ahead.

I lowered Y¤u and tried to open the door of
Himmel.

But the door wouldn't budge.

[Kid]
Sora! Open this door!


{Y7A131}
[Sora]
"That is impossible. That door is out of 
my jurisdiction."

I pounded on the door.

[Kid]
"I know it... on the other side of this 
door...!"

[Kid]
"Y¤u will be safe in there! Please! Open this 
door!"


25 :
Ssssssss!

From the surface of the walls, water began to
gush in.

26 :
An animal-like growl echoed from far away.

The complex pitched violently.

I saw a massive amount of water... flooding
down the corridor ahead.

It was as if a pitch-black monster were
opening its massive mouth to attack.

I ran frantically to Y¤u.

I felt as if I were moving in slow motion.

...I wouldn't make it!

For an instant, time stopped... and then it
started again.

The water swallowed us in a single moment.


27 :
In the water, my eyes met Y¤u's.

She was trying desperately to reach out
her hand.

I held her hand. Y¤u squeezed mine back.

Y¤u mumbled something.

But the words didn't reach me.

The words just changed into small
bubbles... and vanished in the darkness.

Y¤u slowly closed her eyes.

(...Y¤u?)

(What? What did you say...?)

(Of course I want to know...)

I shook her hand. There was no response.

(That's not fair...)

(She's teasing me again...)

I touched her cheek.

It was cold.

(Cold...)

(Of course... it's because we're in
the water...)

(Hahaha... It's because we're in
this cold water...)

I squeezed her hand.

(Hey?)

(I said hey...)

(Hey, Y¤u, tell me...)

She didn't squeeze my hand back.

She didn't move.

She didn't tell me anything anymore.

(......)

(......)

(......)

(...It's not true.)

(No, no, no... It's a lie...)

(This can't be true...!
It has to be a lie...!)

(This is a lie...!)

I let out the last breath from my lungs.

I closed my eyes to avert them from reality.


28 :

{Y4A061}
[Y¤u]
Promise?

[Kid]
Yeah, I promise.


{Y4A062}
[Y¤u]
And what if... you break it?

[Kid]
I won't. I'll see that you're safe.


{Y4A063}
[Y¤u]
"For sure? There's not even a 1% chance 
you're wrong?"

[Kid]
"There is not even a 0.00000000000000001% 
possibility."

[Y¤u]
...


29 :

{Y4A064}
[Y¤u]
"Talk about promising more than you can 
deliver..."


{Y4A065}
[Y¤u]
Oh well. I suppose I'll have to trust you.


30 :
(I didn't make it...)

(I couldn't keep my promise...)

(I couldn't protect her...)

(I was a liar...)

(...A damn liar!)


31 :
Just then, I felt a faint, warm light.

Light?

A ray of light sliced through the plain
dark world.

The door of Himmel started to open...

Beyond the door spread a dazzling white world.

Heaven...

Heaven... was it an illusion?

‡LNo, it wasn't.

It was reality.

It was undoubtedly the truth of my world.

I knew that...

If we went to the place...

On the other side of the door...

We could meet again.

That time, I might be able to protect her.

...Y¤u.


32 :
I...

quietly...

opened my eyes.
