1 :
Y¤u and I sat on the bench in the changing
room, facing opposite directions.

Finally, the two of us were alone.

It was a situation I had been trying
to avoid...

I fidgeted as I thought of the touch
of her lips the day before.

I wondered why we had stayed there.

It was because Y¤u didn't try to go anywhere.

With what Sara had said, I couldn't
just say 'See you' and leave.

If I did that, she'd be able to tell that
I was still hung up on the day before.

I tried not to think about it.

But the more I tried not to think about it,
the more I did.

The part of me that knew all of that pretended
I was unaware of it while acting like I was, but
that just led to me actually being aware of it.



So I tried to pretend not to think about it
as I was pretending to think about it...

Huh?

Then I realized that it was all meaningless!

The more I thought about it, the more confused
I got.


2 :
[Y¤u]
.........

I sat down next to Y¤u and stared at the
ceiling.

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
..................

[Y¤u]
..................

[Kid]
....................................

[Y¤u]
....................................

(Oh, that's right... This silence is bad.)

(I better break it somehow.)

I thought I would try to say something and
calm myself down.

[Kid]
Uh... Um...

[Kid]
Th-those clothes really suit you.


3 :

{Y6A211}
[Y¤u]
Huh?

[Kid]
N-no, I mean... why did you change?

Unfortunately, my mind was still in a state of
confusion and wouldn't follow orders.


4 :

{Y6A212}
[Y¤u]
"Hmmm... I guess maybe you could call it an 
expression of my resolution."

[Kid]
Huh?


5 :

{Y6A213}
[Y¤u]
The reason that I changed!


{Y6A214}
[Y¤u]
You asked me, right?

[Kid]
Y-yeah...


6 :

{Y6A215}
[Y¤u]
"I decided to dump the LeMU uniform... for the 
clothes I normally wear."


{Y6A216}
[Y¤u]
"It's a way of saying goodbye to my LeMU self 
and hello to the normal me."


{Y6A217}
[Y¤u]
"I just wanna get out of here and get back 
to my regular life."


{Y6A218}
[Y¤u]
That's what I decided.

[Kid]
Hmmm... So that's why.


7 :

{Y6A219}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
..................

[Y¤u]
..................

[Kid]
....................................

[Y¤u]
....................................

At that rate, I figured the conversation was
sure to fizzle out.

Uh, I needed something to talk about...

8 :
{11:0-24}
{11:1}The third eye

{11:1}Lemuria

{11:1}Y¤u's past


9 :
[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me! I wanted to ask you 
about the third eye..."


10 :

{Y6A220}
[Y¤u]
The third eye?

[Kid]
Yeah.

[Kid]
...Uh.


11 :

{Y6A057}
[Y¤u]
And the third eye...


{Y6A058}
[Y¤u]
That's... right... here...


12 :
[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me! I wanted to ask you 
about Lemuria."


13 :

{Y6A221}
[Y¤u]
Lemuria?

[Kid]
"Yeah. I mean, I've been there with you several 
times, but every time I go there I feel like 
I've traveled back through time..."

[Kid]
...Oh.


14 :

{Y6A040}
[Y¤u]
You traveled through time, right?


{Y6A041}
[Y¤u]
You experienced all this before, right?


{Y6A042}
[Y¤u]
"In that case, you should know what I'm about 
to do."


15 :
[Kid]
"Oh, that reminds me! I wanted to talk to you 
about your father."


16 :
[Y¤u]
.........


{Y6A222}
[Y¤u]
"I told you I didn't want to talk about that, 
didn't I?"

[Kid]
Huh? Oh, yeah...

[Kid]
...Uh.


17 :

{Y6A013}
[Y¤u]
"I'm sorry, but could we just forget about 
that today?"


{Y6A015}
[Y¤u]
"That wasn't the reason that I invited you 
here today."


{Y6A037}
[Y¤u]
"There's something about being with you that 
relaxes me..."


18 :
Suddenly, I remembered and vividly relived the
feeling of our lips touching the night before.


19 :
[Y¤u]
...........................

[Kid]
...........................

I was sorely regretting that I had brought up
that topic.


{Y6A223}
[Y¤u]
Th-that reminds me...

[Kid]
Eh? Y-yeah?


{Y6A224}
[Y¤u]
"I didn't really tell you about the meaning 
of the concept behind the third eye, did I?"

[Kid]
Uh... No.

[Kid]
You always say 'I'll tell you next time.'


{Y6A225}
[Y¤u]
You're right.


20 :

{Y6A226}
[Y¤u]
"Well, this is a good chance for me to tell 
you the whole story."

[Kid]
Really?

[Kid]
Well, you can skip the boring stuff.


21 :
Y¤u stood up and turned to face me.


22 :

{Y6A227}
[Y¤u]
Ahem...


{Y6A228}
[Y¤u]
"It is time to start Professor Nakkyu's seminar on
the third eye."


23 :
I clapped for her half-heartedly.


24 :

{Y6A229}
[Y¤u]
"First, we'll start with something that's 
blatantly obvious. People have two eyes, 
right?"


{Y6A230}
[Y¤u]
One on the right, one on the left.

Y¤u winked with one eye and then the other.


{Y6A231}
[Y¤u]
"With these two eyes, people are aware of the 
three-dimensional world around them."


{Y6A232}
[Y¤u]
"If you lost the sight in one of your eyes, 
I won't say it would be impossible, but it 
would be difficult to get a sense of the 
world, its depth and dimensions."


{Y6A233}
[Y¤u]
Close one eye for a second.

I closed my right eye as she said.


{Y6A234}
[Y¤u]
"When you look at the world that way, the 
information you get is only enough to 
basically form a flat image of the world."


{Y6A235}
[Y¤u]
"Of course, by focusing on different areas or 
moving your eyes, you could get a sense of the 
three-dimensional image of things, but..."


{Y6A236}
[Y¤u]
"But it wouldn't give you anything close to 
the perspective or 'dimensional awareness' 
that you would have using both eyes."


25 :

{Y6A237}
[Y¤u]
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

[Kid]
...


26 :

{Y6A238}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, I'll leave out the unnecessary 
stuff..."


{Y6A239}
[Y¤u]
In other words, this is what I mean...


{Y6A240}
[Y¤u]
"If a person looks at the world through one 
eye, they only get enough information for a 
flat, or two-dimensional, view."


{Y6A241}
[Y¤u]
Essentially, it's like a picture.


{Y6A242}
[Y¤u]
"If you're looking at a photograph of scenery, 
you have the trees in the foreground, 
a lake in the middle, and a string of mountains 
in the background..."


{Y6A243}
[Y¤u]
"Thus, you get a sense of distance in the 
picture."


{Y6A244}
[Y¤u]
"But that picture is still only two-dimensional, 
right?"


{Y6A245}
[Y¤u]
It was developed on a flat surface.


{Y6A246}
[Y¤u]
"So, a photograph is actually a 
three-dimensional image recreated 
two-dimensionally. Now that 
I think you understand that..."

[Kid]
.........


27 :

{Y6A247}
[Y¤u]
What? You still don't get it?

[Kid]
I don't get it, and my left eye is tired.


{Y6A248}
[Y¤u]
Oh well...


{Y6A249}
[Y¤u]
Okay, this time close your left eye...


28 :

{Y6A250}
[Y¤u]
"Hey! What are you going to see with both eyes 
closed?"


29 :
I held the eyelid of my left eye shut with my
left hand as I opened my right eye.


30 :

{Y6A251}
[Y¤u]
That's it.


{Y6A252}
[Y¤u]
Now, how about we do a little experiment?

[Kid]
Experiment?

Nodding, Y¤u took a marker out of her pocket.

She took the cap off and handed the marker
to me.

[Kid]
So? What do I do?


{Y6A253}
[Y¤u]
"Try to put the pen in the cap that 
I'm holding."


31 :
Y¤u turned the cap sideways and held it in
front of me.

[Kid]
"So you want me to put the tip of this in that 
hole of yours?"


{Y6A254}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. Hurry up.

[Kid]
You want me to put it in?


{Y6A255}
[Y¤u]
Yeah...

I took the shiny black pen, lifted it toward
the little cap that Y¤u held... trying to
put it in...

[Kid]
Huh? That's weird...

[Kid]
I can't find the hole...

The slightly slippery tip wouldn't slip
into the hole.

I tried again and again, but it wouldn't go
where Y¤u wanted it to go.

[Kid]
It should be easier than this...


{Y6A256}
[Y¤u]
Geez, you're really bad at this.

[Kid]
Well, whaddya expect me to do?

[Kid]
It's my first time doing this.


32 :

{Y6A257}
[Y¤u]
Ow...

[Kid]
S-sorry...


{Y6A258}
[Y¤u]
"Where are you poking that thing...? That's the 
wrong spot."


{Y6A259}
[Y¤u]
It's a little closer to you.

[Kid]
Here?


{Y6A260}
[Y¤u]
No, no. Farther back.


{Y6A261}
[Y¤u]
Yeah! Right there! Stick it in! Hurry!

‡LClick.


33 :
[Kid]
I got it! Finally, it's in!


{Y6A262}
[Y¤u]
"Oh good, you did it, and it's your first 
time!"

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
.........


34 :

{Y6A263}
[Y¤u]
Oho... So that is how that works.


{Y6A264}
[Y¤u]
"I think you've seen how hard it is to be 
aware of the different dimensions of things 
from just one perspective..."

[Kid]
So?


{Y6A265}
[Y¤u]
To review, this is what I mean.


{Y6A266}
[Y¤u]
"The information that you get from one point 
is flat, or two-dimensional, information."


{Y6A267}
[Y¤u]
"To get enough information for 
a three-dimensional view, you have 
to have at least two perspectives."


{Y6A268}
[Y¤u]
That is, your right and left eyes...


{Y6A269}
[Y¤u]
"If you don't use two viewpoints, then you 
won't be able to register what's going on 
around you in three dimensions."

[Kid]
?


35 :

{Y6A270}
[Y¤u]
Do you still NOT get it?

[Kid]
I see what you're saying, but...

[Kid]
What does this have to do with the third eye?


{Y6A271}
[Y¤u]
It doesn't have anything to do with it.


{Y6A272}
[Y¤u]
"I've already just about explained the whole 
thing."

[Kid]
?


36 :

{Y6A273}
[Y¤u]
"Alright, let me try something else. Let me 
ask you a question..."


{Y6A274}
[Y¤u]
"What kind of information can you get from one 
perspective?"

[Kid]
You said two-dimensional information, right?


{Y6A275}
[Y¤u]
"And what kind of information can you get 
from two perspectives?"

[Kid]
"I think you said three-dimensional 
information."


{Y6A276}
[Y¤u]
"And from three perspectives, what kind of 
information could you get?"

[Kid]
Hmmm... four-dimensional information, maybe?


37 :
[Kid]
Huh? The fourth dimension!

Y¤u nodded slowly, listening to me.


38 :
So the fourth dimension was...

Wait, what was a dimension anyway?

Y¤u took a notebook out of her locker and
started illustrating her points with diagrams
using the familiar pen.


39 :

Zero-dimensional.

{1}

40 :
{1}

A world made of points.

With zero dimensions, there is no mass nor
area.

It is depicted using coordinates.

Or we might call it 'nothingness', or even
zero.

{16:4}

41 :

One-dimensional.

{1}

42 :
{1}

This is an extension of the point‡Lit is a
straight line.

In other words, a cross-section of
a straight line is a point.

This is depicted by one concept... length.

{16:4}

43 :

Two-dimensional.

{1}

44 :
{1}

This is an extension of the straight line‡Lit
is a flat world.

In other words, a cross-section of a plane, or
flat world, is a straight line.

This is depicted using two concepts... length
and width.

{16:4}

45 :

Three-dimensional.

{1}

46 :
{1}

This is an extension of the flat world‡Lit
is the three-dimensional world.

In other words, a cross-section of the solid
world is a plane, or flat surface.

This is depicted using three concepts...
length, width, and height.

{16:4}

47 :
This isn't the most precise way of putting it,
but you can think of three dimensions as an
area in space composed of length, width, and
height.

(By depicting length, width, and height
on the x, y, and z axes, one axis adds a
vertical element to the other two.)

{16:4}

48 :


{1}{1}{1}{1}

{16:0}And...{16:1}

{16:4}

49 :
The fourth dimension adds a 't' axis, or time,
to these three, and because four dimensions
is no longer just space, it is
called space-time.

One of the x, y, z, and t axes adds a vertical
element, crossing perpendicularly to the other
three.

{16:4}

50 :

Four-dimensional.

{1}

51 :
{1}

This is an extension of three dimensions‡La
world of space and time.

In other words, a cross-section of space-time
is three-dimensional.

Four dimensions are depicted using four
concepts... length, width, height, and time.

{16:4}

52 :
[Kid]
"So basically, if you're able to gain the 
third eye, then you have enough information 
to experience four dimensions."


{Y6A277}
[Y¤u]
Yup. It's space plus time.


{Y6A278}
[Y¤u]
"Just like we can use our two eyes to 
constantly have an image of the space 
in the world before us..."

[Kid]
"So with three perspectives, we can also 
be aware of the cross-cutting element of time."


53 :

{Y6A279}
[Y¤u]
Yup. That's it.

Y¤u put the cap on the pen.

[Kid]
I feel like I kinda understand.


54 :

{Y6A280}
[Y¤u]
What?

[Kid]
My premonitions.

[Kid]
I didn't travel through time.


55 :

{Y6A281}
[Y¤u]
I know! You've gained the third eye!


{Y6A282}
[Y¤u]
That's why you know the future!


{Y6A283}
[Y¤u]
"...Would you stop talking about these stupid 
theories of yours?"

[Kid]
You don't think so?


{Y6A284}
[Y¤u]
Nope!


56 :

{Y6A285}
[Y¤u]
I mean, there's no evidence.


{Y6A286}
[Y¤u]
Why would your third eye suddenly open?


{Y6A287}
[Y¤u]
For what reason? By what method?

[Kid]
"I'll bet... if I get my memory back... then 
I'll..."


{Y6A288}
[Y¤u]
"That again? You always fall back on 
your amnesia."


{Y6A289}
[Y¤u]
"You were looking for the cause of your memory 
loss in the first place, right?"


{Y6A290}
[Y¤u]
"So what do amnesia and the third eye have 
to do with each other?"

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A291}
[Y¤u]
"And what about that ghost girl that 
you said you saw?"

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A292}
[Y¤u]
I mean, it's so naïve, stupid, and childish...

[Kid]
But your mom believed in it, right?


57 :

{Y6A293}
[Y¤u]
We're not going there!


{Y6A294}
[Y¤u]
I don't want to think about the past!


58 :

{Y6A295}
[Y¤u]
I told you that already!


59 :

{Y6A296}
[Y¤u]
I told you yesterday as well!


60 :
[Kid]
But...

[Kid]
Do you like things the way they are?

[Kid]
"You don't care if you never find out who 
your mom and dad were for the rest of 
your life?"


{Y6A297}
[Y¤u]
Stop it!

Y¤u had covered both of her ears in denial.

[Kid]
..................

[Y¤u]
..................

[Kid]
I... I wanted to know about my past.

[Kid]
I still hope to find it out.

[Kid]
"But I don't have my memory nor any clue 
to go by, so..."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
You have... your memory, right?


61 :

{Y6A298}
[Y¤u]
‡L!

[Kid]
"So that means that you have something that 
I don't have. You have a clue."

[Kid]
"And more than that, you were able to get 
information from LeMMIH."

[Kid]
"So how come you still don't want to think 
about it?"

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"I thought you came to LeMU because you 
wanted to find out the truth."

[Kid]
Why'd you change your mind?

[Kid]
Did something make you change?

[Y¤u]
..................

[Kid]
Why are you denying your past?

[Kid]
Isn't that the same as denying yourself?

[Kid]
With your own two eyes...


62 :
[Kid]
Why don't you try to face the truth directly?

[Y¤u]
...........................


63 :
[Kid]
Y¤u!

I grabbed Y¤u's arms and pulled them away
from her ears.

[Kid]
Answer me! Why!?

[Kid]
"Why do you want to give up when you're 
almost there?"

[Kid]
"Why throw away everything that you've 
worked so hard for?"

I shouted at her.

Because I couldn't believe what she was doing.

It was something that she would be hard
pressed to find in her wildest dreams...

And just as she was about to attain it,
she had suddenly changed her mind.

I was nowhere near reaching my dream.

But Y¤u's was almost within her reach.

So I felt... terribly... terribly...

...Disappointed.

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
I don't get it.

[Kid]
"What you've longed to know is right in 
front of you, and..."

[Kid]
I was so jealous... and so happy for you.

[Kid]
Why...?

[Y¤u]
.........


64 :

{Y6A299}
[Y¤u]
I got scared.

[Kid]
Huh?


65 :

{Y6A300}
[Y¤u]
I got scared of learning the truth!

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A301}
[Y¤u]
"Think about it! Everything that I've 
believed for so long has turned out 
to be lies."


{Y6A302}
[Y¤u]
It's all just fiction...!


{Y6A303}
[Y¤u]
"Tell me! Is that supposed to happen? 
Is it normal?"


{Y6A304}
[Y¤u]
"I can't believe anymore... I can't believe 
anything."

[Kid]
..................


66 :

{Y6A305}
[Y¤u]
"I didn't know... that the truth was 
this painful."

Y¤u put her hand on her chest.


{Y6A306}
[Y¤u]
It hurts.


{Y6A307}
[Y¤u]
My heart hurts.


{Y6A308}
[Y¤u]
"The closer I get to the truth, the more 
my heart gets shredded to bits..."


{Y6A309}
[Y¤u]
I can't take it anymore...!

[Kid]
.............................................


{Y6A310}
[Y¤u]
I don't want to know anymore...


{Y6A311}
[Y¤u]
I don't want to know... what is real!


67 :
A sudden sound and shaking made us look up.



68 :
The next instant, warning alarms started
shrieking.

All around me, the squeal of straining
metal echoed from the structure.

The shaking continued on and off.

Wh-what...


{Y6A312}
[Y¤u]
No... No way...!

[Kid]
Could implosion already have started...?

It was 5:45 p.m.

The estimated time of implosion was 4:30 a.m.
on May 7th.

But given the twelve-hour margin of error,
I thought it could well be the implosion.

We burst out of the room.


69 :
The corridor was flooded, and the water level
was rising.

I was stunned by how high the water
already was...


70 :
In a little while, the alarm ceased.

It looked like the flooding had been stopped
just in time.

[Kid]
It looks like it's under control...


71 :

{Y6A313}
[Y¤u]
Yeah...

[Kid]
I wonder if everybody's alright.


{Y6A314}
[Y¤u]
Let's go check.


72 :

{Y6A315}
[Y¤u]
Sora? Sora? Can you hear me?

But there was no response.

[Kid]
"It's no good... I bet the sensors are out of 
whack..."


73 :

{Y6A316}
[Y¤u]
"Should we go find Sora first? She's probably 
in the control room."

[Kid]
Yeah.


74 :
We put our argument aside for the moment and
concentrated on handling the situation at hand.

Y¤u and I headed down to the third floor.


75 :

{Y6A317}
[Y¤u]
We have to find a way out of here, fast!

Y¤u sprinted down the stairs.

[Kid]
...

Even though we were in the middle of a crisis,
I couldn't get my mind off of what we were
talking about.

The mystery surrounding Y¤u's parents.

And my inexplicable premonitions.

I just had a feeling that those two things
were somehow connected to the third eye.

(Why? Why can't I shake this feeling?)


76 :
We reached the third floor.

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u.


77 :

{Y6A318}
[Y¤u]
What? What's wrong?

[Kid]
I was just thinking...

[Kid]
"I was thinking that the thing about your 
parents and the stuff that's been happening 
to me might have something in common."

[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
"I get the feeling that... the third eye 
ties them together somehow."


78 :

{Y6A319}
[Y¤u]
"What're you talking about? Do you know what 
kind of situation we're in right now?"


{Y6A320}
[Y¤u]
This is about whether we live or die!


{Y6A321}
[Y¤u]
That's not important now!

[Kid]
It is!

[Kid]
But you said that your mom said the third eye...


{Y6A322}
[Y¤u]
Don't you talk to me about my mom!


79 :

{Y6A323}
[Y¤u]
That person... is not my...!


80 :
Y¤u stopped mid-sentence.


81 :
Suddenly, she lifted her head and started
running.

I hurriedly went after her.


82 :

{Y6A324}
[Y¤u]
That person... is not my mother.


83 :
After saying that, Y¤u turned and started
walking.

Looking straight ahead, she made for the
control room.

I followed her.


84 :
Sora wasn't inside.

I looked at the life reading numbers.


85 :
Not being human, Sora wouldn't register on
the bio scan, so the number 'five' matched with
the number of us that we knew to be stuck
in LeMU.

In other words, everyone was alive.


86 :
Y¤u sat in the chair and typed on the keyboard,
calling up the login page for the database.

Incidentally, Sora had removed the login
restriction that had kept us from accessing it
before.


87 :

{Y6A325}
[Y¤u]
I figured it out. I know how to do it.

[Kid]
What?


{Y6A326}
[Y¤u]
How to get authorization clearance.

[Kid]
So you figured out the password mystery?


88 :
Y¤u shook her head.


{Y6A327}
[Y¤u]
That's not what I mean.

[Kid]
What then?


{Y6A328}
[Y¤u]
"'The empty fall sky
A single cuckoo calls out
Brings a chill to me'."


{Y6A329}
[Y¤u]
That should be the password.

[Kid]
"But you couldn't get through with that 
before, right?"


89 :
Y¤u input the password.


90 :
'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

[Kid]
See?


{Y6A330}
[Y¤u]
No, that's not what I mean.


{Y6A331}
[Y¤u]
It wasn't the password that was wrong.


{Y6A332}
[Y¤u]
It was the name.

Y¤u moved the cursor to the name column.

It read 'Tanaka Yukie'.


{Y6A333}
[Y¤u]
That person wasn't my real mother...


{Y6A334}
[Y¤u]
So her name wasn't Tanaka Yukie...


{Y6A335}
[Y¤u]
"So she wasn't registered under that name 
at all!"


{Y6A336}
[Y¤u]
So...


{Y6A337}
[Y¤u]
"So if I can figure out what her real 
name is..."

[Kid]
Her name...

[Kid]
Name...


91 :

{Y6A338}
[Y¤u]
Hmmmm... Hhmmmm...

[Kid]
"You never saw a driver's license or any 
document with your mom's name on it?"


92 :

{Y6A339}
[Y¤u]
Nope. Not even once.

[Kid]
I see...


{Y6A340}
[Y¤u]
"Until now, I never even dreamed that 
she was lying about being my mother."


{Y6A341}
[Y¤u]
"I always thought that she was my mom... That 
she was 'Tanaka Yukie'..."


{Y6A342}
[Y¤u]
"That was what she said... Normally, no one 
would ever think that their parent is lying 
about their name."

[Kid]
That's true...


93 :

{Y6A343}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...


94 :

{Y6A344}
[Y¤u]
It's no good...! I've got no clue.

Y¤u put her arms around her head and bowed
it down.


{Y6A345}
[Y¤u]
There are just so many possible patterns...

[Kid]
"But you could narrow it down a certain 
degree, right?"

[Kid]
"Even if she were using a fake name, I'll bet 
it has something in common with her real one."

[Kid]
"Like the initials are the same, or 
something..."


{Y6A346}
[Y¤u]
I don't think that's very likely.


95 :

{Y6A347}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, she was impersonating my mom, Tanaka
Yukie, after all. It's not like she made 
up some 'Fictional Woman A'."


{Y6A348}
[Y¤u]
"So, I think it makes more sense to assume that 
their names won't have anything in common."


{Y6A349}
[Y¤u]
"If she was a complete stranger, there's no 
reason for her last name to even be 'Tanaka'."

[Kid]
Yeah... I guess you're right.


{Y6A350}
[Y¤u]
"Besides, even if the first character of her 
name was the same..."


{Y6A351}
[Y¤u]
"She could be called Yui, Yuka, Yuki, Yuko, 
Yuna, Yuno, Yuma, Yumi, Yuri, Yue, Yukari, 
Yukiko, Yukina, Yukino..."


{Y6A352}
[Y¤u]
"...Yukimi, Yusako, Yutaka, Yuzuki, Yuho, 
Yuma, Yumika, Yumiko, Yumina, Yumeko, Yumemi, 
Yuyu, Yuria, Yuriko..."

[Kid]
...............


{Y6A353}
[Y¤u]
"And those are all just off the top of my 
head."


{Y6A354}
[Y¤u]
"The chances are slim, and she could have 
a bizarre name like mine."

[Kid]
A bizarre name...

[Kid]
"That reminds me, you still haven't told me 
your full name..."

[Kid]
I remember you saying it was really long.


{Y6A355}
[Y¤u]
Yeah... It goes on forever.


{Y6A356}
[Y¤u]
So people always get it wrong.

[Kid]
No kidding?


{Y6A357}
[Y¤u]
...Do you want me to tell you?

[Kid]
Your full name?


{Y6A358}
[Y¤u]
Yeah.

[Kid]
Of course I do.


96 :

{Y6A359}
[Y¤u]
"It's kinda embarrassing, so I don't usually 
tell people, but..."


97 :

{Y6A360}
[Y¤u]
Since it's you, I'll tell you.

[Kid]
............


{Y6A361}
[Y¤u]
But you have to promise not to laugh. Okay?

[Kid]
S-sure...


{Y6A362}
[Y¤u]
Alright! Here I go!


{Y6A363}
[Y¤u]
My name is...


{Y6A364}
[Y¤u]
Tanaka...


{Y6A365}
[Y¤u]
Yubisei...


{Y6A366}
[Y¤u]
...akikana.

[Kid]
Huh...?


{Y6A367}
[Y¤u]
"It means 'gentle beautiful pure autumn
fragrant green blossom'."

[Kid]
...............

(Tanaka... Yubiseiakikana...)


98 :

{Y6A368}
[Y¤u]
So? Whaddya think?

[Kid]
............


99 :

{Y6A369}
[Y¤u]
"I know. It's such a long name that you don't know 
what to do with it."

[Kid]
"No... It's not exactly... that... It's 
the aki..."

[Kid]
'Aki'...?

Yubisei'aki'kana.

[Kid]
Is that really it?


100 :

{Y6A370}
[Y¤u]
"Geez! Really? You don't believe me? It's 
my name. It is!"

[Kid]
That's not what I meant...


{Y6A371}
[Y¤u]
Anyway, come with me.

Y¤u took my hand and led me out of the
control room.


101 :
We headed into the Lemurian Ruins.

[Kid]
"Listen, I don't think now is the time for 
this!"


102 :

{Y6A372}
[Y¤u]
Be quiet!


103 :

{Y6A373}
[Y¤u]
"Even if YOU don't like it, it is still 
my name, so..."


{Y6A374}
[Y¤u]
It's the name that my mom gave me...


{Y6A375}
[Y¤u]
So you have to believe me!

[Kid]
.........

Y¤u stood in front of a door at the edge
of the room.


104 :

{Y6A376}
[Y¤u]
"This is the room for operators to run the 
theme park."


{Y6A377}
[Y¤u]
"This room is used to adjust the lighting, 
the air conditioning, observation cameras, 
and other stuff..."


{Y6A378}
[Y¤u]
"This door is set up so that park visitors 
can't accidentally open it. Only registered 
staff can open it."


{Y6A379}
[Y¤u]
"You have to undergo a fingerprint and voice 
check to open it."

[Kid]
So what?


{Y6A380}
[Y¤u]
"I'm a member of staff, so of course I'm 
registered here."


{Y6A381}
[Y¤u]
"That means that if I don't say my proper 
name, the door won't open."


{Y6A382}
[Y¤u]
"So, if the name I just told you is a lie, then 
it won't open the door."


{Y6A383}
[Y¤u]
Get it?

[Kid]
Yeah. I got it.


{Y6A384}
[Y¤u]
Seeing is believing, right? Let me show you.


{Y6A385}
[Y¤u]
You ready? Watch closely.


105 :
Y¤u put her hand on the panel next to the door.

The panel had a lamp that was shining red.


{Y6A386}
[Y¤u]
Tanaka Yubiseiakikana.


106 :
Beep!

Responding to her voice, the lamp turned green,
and then...


107 :
Whiiiir!

The door opened.


108 :

{Y6A387}
[Y¤u]
So? Believe me now?

[Kid]
...Yeah.

With that, I thought I had to believe her.


109 :
We returned back to the control room.

That whole time, Y¤u's name kept churning
through my mind.

Yubiseiakikana...

...Akikana...

(...Aki...)

The truth was a lie.

The lie was true.

My mind was confused with what might be true
and what false.

...But...

(I thought that if a name had autumn,
or 'aki', in it, there might as well be one
with spring, or 'haru', in it.)

Gradually, I became convinced that it could
be right.


110 :
When we got back to the control room,
we decided to review escape routes.

...But at that point, we really didn't expect
to find anything new.


111 :
We didn't think it was a good idea to move
from where we were.

People on the outside might have found out
what had happened and be on the way.

So we decided to try to think of a way out.


112 :
We looked at a map of the complex and talked
about various possibilities.

...But at that point, we really didn't expect
to find anything new.


113 :

{Y6A388}
[Y¤u]
Huh!?

[Kid]
Wh-what... What does that shout mean...?


{Y6A389}
[Y¤u]
Could it be... that this...


{Y6A390}
[Y¤u]
Could this be a message from the outside?

[Kid]
What...!?


114 :
Suddenly, the monitor displayed an image.

It was a shaky video mixed with static...

When the screen finally settled down...


115 :
It showed the face of a girl that I didn't
recognize.

[Y¤u]
.........


116 :

{Y6A391}
[Y¤u]
M-mother...

Was she...?

Was she... Y¤u's mother...?


{Y6A392}
[Y¤u]
No...


{Y6A393}
[Y¤u]
You're not... Are you?


{Y6A394}
[Y¤u]
You're not really my mother, are you?


{Y6A395}
[Woman]
That's right...


{Y6A396}
[Woman]
I am not your mother...


{Y6A397}
[Y¤u]
‡L!


{Y6A398}
[Y¤u]
You are... terrible...


{Y6A399}
[Y¤u]
How could you lie to me all this time...?


{Y6A400}
[Woman]
I can't talk about that yet.


117 :

{Y6A401}
[Y¤u]
Why not!?


{Y6A402}
[Y¤u]
You've deceived me all along, and...


{Y6A403}
[Y¤u]
You even want hide the truth now!?


{Y6A404}
[Woman]
I never deceived you...


{Y6A405}
[Woman]
I may not be able to call myself your mother.


{Y6A406}
[Woman]
But... But, Y¤u, you are really my child.


{Y6A407}
[Woman]
You were born of my body...


{Y6A408}
[Y¤u]
Don't lie to me!


{Y6A409}
[Woman]
I'm sorry... Y¤u...


{Y6A410}
[Woman]
After you come up here, I will tell you...


{Y6A411}
[Y¤u]
Here? Where is here? Where are you?


{Y6A412}
[Woman]
I am on Insel Null‡Lthe floating island.


{Y6A413}
[Y¤u]
Huh? What are you talking about?


{Y6A414}
[Y¤u]
...What are you...?


118 :
‡LThe woman vanished from the screen.

‡LThen a man appeared.


119 :

{Y6A901}
[Man]
"We are about to start operating the 
high-pressure air intake fan from the floating 
island."

{Y6A902}
[Man]
"It will remove the water from the emergency 
stairs near the central area and 
the emergency corridor connected to them."

{Y6A416}
[Man]
"The estimated time of completion is 
9:30 p.m.‡Lthree hours from now."


{Y6A417}
[Man]
"When the water is cleared, we want you to 
climb the emergency stairs to the surface 
island."


{Y6A418}
[Man]
Please remain where you are until then.


{Y6A419}
[Y¤u]
Who... are you?


{Y6A420}
[Man]
"I will explain everything once you are 
up here."


{Y6A421}
[Man]
"It's not the kind of thing we should talk 
about via a display."

[Y¤u]
.........


{Y6A422}
[Man]
"But, Y¤u, there is one thing I want you 
to know."


{Y6A423}
[Man]
Your mother loves you more than anything.


{Y6A424}
[Man]
Please don't forget that.


120 :
Eventually, the others straggled into the
control room.

Takeshi, Sara, Tsugumi... and Sora.

I told them about the message we had just had.

The others couldn't hide their surprise.

It was such sudden, unexpected good news.


Some of them even thought it might be a trap.

Of course, that was what I thought at
first too.

My skeptical mind wanted to ask, 'Why now...?'

{16:4}

121 :
We felt like a trick might still be being
played on us, but we had no other choice but
to go along with it.

There were only a few hours left until LeMU
imploded.

There were no other options left for us.

{16:4}

122 :
We moved to the conference room and waited
for the time that the water would be cleared.

The six of us said hardly anything.

Everyone just stared off in space, waiting
impatiently for time to pass.

Y¤u slumped back in a chair and stared
blankly at the ceiling.

She looked like a puppet with its strings cut.

The room was tense with anticipation.

I couldn't handle it and decided to...

123 :
{11:0-27}
{11:1}Talk to Takeshi

{11:1}Talk to Y¤u

{11:1}Talk to Tsugumi

{11:1}Talk to Sora

{11:1}Talk to Sara


124 :
[Kid]
Hey, Takeshi?


125 :

{Y6A425}
[Takeshi]
Yeah? What?

[Kid]
What were you so busy doing before?


{Y6A426}
[Takeshi]
Oh... That was...


{Y6A427}
[Takeshi]
"Well, I guess you could say... I was looking 
for something."

[Kid]
Looking for something?


{Y6A428}
[Takeshi]
Yeah.

[Kid]
Did you find it?


126 :

{Y6A429}
[Takeshi]
No... Unfortunately, not yet.


{Y6A430}
[Takeshi]
I... haven't found it...

[Kid]
Did you give up?


127 :

{Y6A431}
[Takeshi]
You kidding? Think I'd give up?


{Y6A432}
[Takeshi]
I can't give up.

[Kid]
.........


128 :

{Y6A433}
[Takeshi]
"But right now, I'll have to take a break from 
the search."

[Kid]
I see...

[Kid]
I hope you find whatever you're looking for.


129 :

{Y6A434}
[Takeshi]
Yeah.


{Y6A435}
[Takeshi]
...Thanks.


130 :
[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u?


131 :
[Y¤u]
.........

[Kid]
Hey, YøU!


132 :

{Y6A436}
[Y¤u]
Eh? What...? Did you just call me?

[Kid]
Yeah.


{Y6A437}
[Y¤u]
"Uh... Would you mind leaving me alone right 
now?"


{Y6A438}
[Y¤u]
"I don't really feel like talking about 
anything."

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A439}
[Y¤u]
"I'm sorry... but there's something that 
I want to think through."

[Kid]
I understand... I'm sorry to bug you.

[Y¤u]
.........

I figured that it must have been a real shock
for her... to find out that the lady had been
pretending to be her mother.

It looked like all of our guesses had been
right on target...


133 :
[Kid]
Hey, Tsugumi?


134 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

[Kid]
Hey, TSUGUMI!


135 :

{Y6A440}
[Tsugumi]
Shut up!

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A441}
[Tsugumi]
Don't talk to me.


{Y6A442}
[Tsugumi]
Do me a favor and just sit still.


{Y6A443}
[Tsugumi]
Because there's nothing left to worry about.


{Y6A444}
[Tsugumi]
"There can't possibly be anything else you 
want to ask me about, right?"

[Kid]
.........


{Y6A445}
[Tsugumi]
"It's a good thing that my prediction was off, 
huh?"

[Kid]
Th-that's what I wanted to ask...


136 :
[Tsugumi]
.........

But after that, Tsugumi didn't say anything
more.

Well, just one more thing...


137 :

{Y6A446}
[Tsugumi]
Geez...


{Y6A447}
[Tsugumi]
What the heck is going on...?


138 :
[Kid]
Hey, Sora?


139 :

{Y6A448}
[Sora]
Yes? What is it?

[Kid]
Where were you before?


{Y6A449}
[Sora]
LeMMIH called me.

[Kid]
LeMMIH?


{Y6A450}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Kid]
...

[Sora]
...

[Kid]
"Does it have to do with that industrial 
secret?"

No, that would have been strange.

Sora was already free from obeying the
Leiblich's restrictions.


140 :

{Y6A451}
[Sora]
No, it had nothing to do with that...


{Y6A452}
[Sora]
I don't think I can tell you about it yet.

[Kid]
"You mean you'll tell me when the time is 
right?"


{Y6A453}
[Sora]
Yes.

[Kid]
Okay. Then I won't ask you anymore.


{Y6A454}
[Sora]
I'm sorry.

And saying that, Sora dropped her head.


141 :
[Kid]
Hey, Sara?


142 :

{Y6A455}
[Sara]
What?

[Kid]
What was it that you had to do after that?

Of course, I meant after we split up in the
changing room.

The expression she'd had on her face had
bothered me ever since.

[Kid]
"I think you said that you had to settle 
something or other."


143 :

{Y6A456}
[Sara]
That's...


{Y6A457}
[Sara]
...A secret.

[Kid]
Really?


{Y6A458}
[Sara]
Why? I wish you wouldn't invade my privacy.

[Kid]
...I'm sorry.


{Y6A459}
[Sara]
Well, it's no big deal.

[Kid]
"Will you tell me this much? Did you finish 
whatever it was?"


144 :

{Y6A460}
[Sara]
Of course I did.

[Kid]
Well, that's good.


145 :
[Sara]
.........


{Y6A461}
[Sara]
"I'm not gonna go along with what everybody 
wants anymore."

[Kid]
Huh?

[Sara]
.........

[Kid]
You mean your mom and your dad?


{Y6A462}
[Sara]
"No... That's different... but it might be kinda 
similar."


{Y6A463}
[Sara]
"I've decided that I'm going to live the 
way that I want to live from now on."

[Kid]
.........


146 :

{Y6A464}
[Sara]
I wonder where I'll go when we're out.

[Kid]
You're not going home?


{Y6A465}
[Sara]
I'm not. That place isn't my home anyway.

[Kid]
...?


{Y6A466}
[Sara]
"So I'll look for the place that 
I should be going back to."

[Kid]
Well, that's the same as me.

[Kid]
I know! Will you take me with you?


147 :

{Y6A467}
[Sara]
Huh? You?

[Kid]
"Yeah. I mean, I don't have anywhere to go 
either. I'll look with you."

[Sara]
.........


148 :

{Y6A468}
[Sara]
Thanks.


{Y6A469}
[Sara]
But I think not.

[Kid]
What? Why not?


{Y6A470}
[Sara]
"Because... I'm pretty sure someone'll hold it 
against me."

[Kid]
Who?


149 :
But Sara just grinned at me without answering.


{Y6A471}
[Sara]
Nin! Nin! Ninja!


150 :
Finally, the appointed time arrived.


151 :
We climbed to the second floor and stood at
the emergency corridor.

Then we began walking to the central core.

...Finally, we reached a dead end.

The watertight door was shut because the
area from there onward was filled with
seawater.


152 :
The door swung open.


153 :
The water was gone.

We continued heading toward the center through
the dry corridor.

......

Sara, Takeshi, and Tsugumi walked ahead....

Y¤u, Sora, and I walked a few dozen meters
behind them.

......


{Y6A472}
[Takeshi]
Hey! We're going ahead!

It seemed like Takeshi had already reached the
emergency stairs.

Sara, Takeshi, and Tsugumi disappeared up the
stairs.


154 :
But immediately after that‡L


155 :
[Kid]
Oh no!


156 :

{Y6A473}
[Sora]
This is bad! Water is flooding in!


{Y6A474}
[Sora]
"...Sector Three... The partition on the emergency 
corridor is collapsing...!"


{Y6A475}
[Sora]
Water is rushing in 51 meters ahead!


157 :
The sound of rushing water could be heard
in the distance!


158 :

{Y6A476}
[Sora]
It's no good! We won't make it! Go back now!


159 :
The door leading to the emergency stairs was
swallowed by water.

[Kid]
Y¤u, what're you doing? Run! Now!


160 :

{Y6A477}
[Y¤u]
...Okay...

[Kid]
Now hang on!

I grabbed Y¤u's hand and doubled back.


161 :
We fled to the security office.

Y¤u, Sora, and I were there.

It looked like the flooding had subsided...

According to Sora, there were only a few
dry areas left in the complex.


162 :
A message came from outside.


{Y6A478}
[Man]
The other three are fine!


{Y6A479}
[Man]
Are you alright?

[Kid]
Yeah, I think so...


{Y6A480}
[Man]
"That flooding was apparently a 
miscalculation on our part."


{Y6A481}
[Man]
"I don't think we got the partition 
strength wrong."


{Y6A482}
[Man]
So... we don't know what caused it.

[Kid]
What do you want us to do now?


{Y6A483}
[Man]
"For now, you wait there. We'll come up with 
something soon."

[Kid]
"Can't you use the high-pressure gas fan to 
get rid of the water again?"


{Y6A484}
[Man]
Actually... no...


{Y6A485}
[Man]
"The thing won't work... and we're not sure 
why..."

[Kid]
Huh? What? I'm having trouble hearing you.

Static had broken up part of the message, and
I hadn't caught it.

It looked like another crisis had struck.

From the speaker on their side, we heard a
lot of hurried noise and a rush of air.


{Y6A486}
[Man]
What is... Is that... real...?


{Y6A487}
[Man]
Is that...


{Y6A488}
[Man]
...lick... kel...


{Y6A489}
[Man]
...Blick Winkel... is... here...

And then... communications were cut off.

[Kid]
Sora...?

With a solemn look, Sora shook her head.

[Kid]
............

[Kid]
Damn it! We were almost there!

[Kid]
Why this? Why did this happen to us...?

I punched the console.

[Kid]
I don't get any of this...

[Kid]
What is that...? Blick Winkel?

[Kid]
Hey, Sora... What does this mean...?


163 :
[Sora]
............

Sora shook her head again.


164 :
I sighed and sat down in a chair.

Y¤u sat slumped in the chair next to me.


I looked at the monitor.


165 :
It displayed the life reading for the complex.

'Life readings: 3'

[Kid]
.........Huh?

‡LThree!?

I wondered why. Only Y¤u, Sora, and I were
left in LeMU...

And Sora... The bio scan shouldn't pick
her up...


166 :
[Kid]
What is this? Is this broken...?


167 :
[Kid]
What does this mean? Sora?


{Y6A490}
[Sora]
I... I don't know...


{Y6A491}
[Sora]
...I know that something is happening...


{Y6A492}
[Sora]
But I haven't been informed what...

[Kid]
.........

I stood up from the chair.

Just then, my elbow bumped an empty can on the
table.


168 :
Kabang!


169 :
Clatter, clatter, clatter...

The can fell to the floor and rolled to the
wall.

[Kid]
.........

[Kid]
Is the floor...?

(The floor is tilting!)

[Kid]
Hey, Sora, can you display the map of LeMU?

[Kid]
"Something that has a cross-sectional 
display of the structure."


170 :

{Y6A493}
[Sora]
Certainly.


171 :
A map of LeMU appeared on the monitor.

[Kid]
It's like I thought...

[Kid]
LeMU is... slanting...

But the tilt of the complex didn't really mean
anything.

Thankfully, it didn't look like it was
affecting our chances of survival.


172 :
[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u... Whaddya think we should do now?


173 :
[Y¤u]
....................................

[Kid]
Y¤u...?

Y¤u was completely dazed.

It didn't even look like my voice was
reaching her brain....

It seemed that the light of the world had
been extinguished from her eyes.
