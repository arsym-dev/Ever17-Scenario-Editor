{C1T093}
[Y¤u]
£o¢o... Do you have a headache?


{C1T094}
[£o¢o]
Yeah, a bit. I feel kinda dizzy...


{C1T095}
[Y¤u]
Does it hurt if you swing your arms around?


{C1T096}
[£o¢o]
Just a little...

But it looked like it hurt more than 'just a
little'.


{C1T097}
[Sora]
"I suspect it might be decompression 
sickness due to the sudden loss of 
pressure on this floor."


{C1T098}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, it could well be.

2 :
{11:0-75}
{11:1}What's decompression sickness?

{11:2-d0}Is it really decompression sickness?


3 :
[Takeshi]
Wait a minute!


{C1T099}
[Sora]
.........


4 :

{C1T100}
[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
What's decompression sickness?


{C1T101}
[Sora]
I will explain it later.


{C1T102}
[Y¤u]
"That can wait. We need to get £o¢o to the 
infirmary."


{C1T103}
[Y¤u]
Hey, Kuranari... Give her a piggyback ride...

[Takeshi]
Huh?


5 :

{T1C312}
[Y¤u]
On your back! Hurry up and squat down!

[Takeshi]
Huh? You want me to carry you?


{C1T104}
[Y¤u]
You idiot! This is no time for joking around!


{C1T105}
[Y¤u]
You're gonna carry £O£O on your back!

[Takeshi]
"Alright already! You don't have to scream in 
my ear!"

I crouched down in front of £o¢o and loaded
her on my back.


6 :
[Takeshi]
Wait a minute!


7 :

{C1T106}
[Sora]
.........


{C1T107}
[Y¤u]
.........

[Takeshi]
Is it really decompression sickness?


{C1T108}
[Y¤u]
What?


{C1T109}
[Sora]
What exactly do you mean?

[Takeshi]
"I mean, well, you know... It might be 
something else..."

[Takeshi]
You know, I just kinda thought...


8 :

{C1T110}
[Y¤u]
Okay, wise guy, what do you think she's got?

[Takeshi]
I've got no idea. How should I know?

[Takeshi]
"It's just... you know... Aren't the symptoms 
different?"


{C1T111}
[Sora]
"Do you have any specialized knowledge about 
medical matters, Kuranari-san?"

[Takeshi]
Nope, not at all. Not a clue.

[Takeshi]
But, but, I'm just kinda worried!

Y¤u and Sora tilted their heads curiously.


9 :
The Kid, his face anxious, was holding Pipi.

£o¢o was clearly exhausted, and it looked hard
for her to stand.

It was Tsugumi who was holding £o¢o's body up.


10 :

{C1T112}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Sora. What about the... uh, that thing...
in the infirmary?"


{C1T113}
[Y¤u]
"Wasn't there some device that can diagnose 
medical conditions?"


11 :

{C1T114}
[Sora]
Do you mean the L-MRI?


12 :

{C1T115}
[Y¤u]
Yeah, yeah, that's it.


{C1T116}
[Y¤u]
"If you do a scan with that, can't we tell 
sure if it's decompression sickness?"


13 :

{C1T117}
[Sora]
Unfortunately, no, we cannot.


{C1T118}
[Y¤u]
Really? Why not?


{C1T119}
[Sora]
"I already looked into that. The machine is out of
order."


{C1T120}
[Sora]
"Discovering the problem and repairing it would
take time and energy."


14 :

{C1T121}
[Y¤u]
Oh, really...


15 :

{C1T122}
[Kid]
"Well, anyway, there's no use talking about it 
here!"


{C1T123}
[Kid]
"We've gotta get £o¢o to the infirmary right 
away!"

[Takeshi]
Yeah, we should get going.

I crouched down in front of £o¢o and loaded
her on my back.


16 :
We were rushing up to Zweiter Stock, some
seventeen meters above us.

I held £o¢o on my back, with Y¤u and
Tsugumi supporting her from the sides.

Sora led the way, and the Kid brought
up the rear.


17 :
We emerged at the second floor emergency
corridor.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, are you sure we shouldn't take a normal 
corridor?"


18 :

{C1T124}
[Sora]
"Please proceed straight ahead. This is a 
shortcut."


19 :
The emergency corridor was directly connected
to the lift below the infirmary.

[Takeshi]
Whew! We made it. Let's get her up there.


{C1T125}
[Sora]
"No, Kuranari-san. Please go ahead into that room 
there."

[Takeshi]
Huh?


20 :

{C1T126}
[Sora]
"This is a medical compression chamber. We 
can treat decompression sickness here."


21 :

{C1T127}
[Sora]
"Indeed, as Kuranari-san observed, we cannot be 
certain whether or not it is decompression 
sickness right now."


{C1T128}
[Sora]
"However, assuming that it is decompression 
sickness, if we do not act immediately, her 
chances of recovery decrease immensely..."

[Takeshi]
"So this, uh, recompression thing, we can do it 
here?"


{C1T129}
[Sora]
Yes, that is correct.


22 :
I laid £o¢o down on the bed.

Y¤u, Tsugumi, and the Kid all studied £o¢o's
face.

[Takeshi]
"Hey, wait a minute, Sora. What are we gonna 
do if it turns out to be something else?"


23 :

{C1T130}
[Sora]
"Compression treatment has no side effects in 
and of itself."


{C1T131}
[Sora]
"Furthermore, even if it is a different 
illness, I do not think it will make her 
condition worse."


{C1T132}
[Sora]
"Therefore, I think we should try this once 
and observe her condition. If there is no 
improvement, we should then consider another 
approach."


{C1T133}
[Sora]
"This seems to me to be the most appropriate 
treatment at the moment."


24 :

{C1T134}
[Y¤u]
Just let her sleep there.

[Takeshi]
Okay, I got it.


25 :
£o¢o lay on the bed.

Tsugumi and the Kid stood next to me and
looked down at £o¢o.

[Takeshi]
"So, Y¤u, what are you gonna do in this tiny 
room? Isn't it a little cramped for examining 
her?"

The space was so small that we could hardly
move with everyone in there.


26 :

{C1T135}
[Y¤u]
I'm not going to do anything.

[Takeshi]
...What're you talking about?


{C1T136}
[Y¤u]
"We're going to have £o¢o relax in this room 
for a while."

[Takeshi]
?

I tilted my head, confused.


{C1T137}
[Sora]
"This is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Allow me 
to explain."


27 :

{C1T138}
[Sora]
"Decompression sickness occurs when there is 
a sudden change in the surrounding air 
pressure and gas bubbles that can't be 
discharged accrue in the body."


{C1T139}
[Sora]
"Gas becomes air bubbles, and these gather in 
tissues or veins. When gas bubbles remain 
inside the body, the oxygen respiration 
efficiency drops dramatically."

[Takeshi]
"So... No matter how many deep breaths you 
take, it feels like you're suffocating?"


28 :

{C1T901}
[Sora]
"Yes. But also, if any nitrogen 
which had dissolved in the blood turns to gas, 
it could produce a thrombus, or blood clot."

{C1T902}
[Sora]
"Of course, this could hinder blood circulation,
which is very dangerous..."

{C1T141}
[Sora]
"So we will seal this room and pump in a high 
concentration of oxygen, slowly taking it up to 
approximately three atmospheres..."


{C1T142}
[Sora]
"After that, we slowly decompress it back down to 
one atmosphere."


{C1T143}
[Sora]
"Using this difference in pressure, we 
dissolve the gas bubbles in the body 
back into the blood, where they are 
removed naturally by breathing."

[Takeshi]
"So basically, you make us like a can of cola 
that won't blow up..."


{C1T144}
[Sora]
Yes, precisely.


29 :
[Takeshi]
Okay, I got it.

I lifted my hand.

[Takeshi]
"Gosh, that dash up the stairs sure wore me 
out..."

I heaved a breath.


30 :

{C1T145}
[Sora]
Oh, Kuranari-san, are you in pain at all?

[Takeshi]
"Huh, me? My muscles feel kinda sore, and I'm 
a bit sluggish, but..."


31 :

{C1T146}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari, don't you think you should 
probably go in the room too?"


{C1T147}
[Y¤u]
"In light cases of decompression sickness, 
you aren't necessarily aware of it 
immediately."

[Takeshi]
"After you figure out you're in trouble, it's 
too late...?"


{C1T148}
[Y¤u]
Yeah. And the symptoms can be drawn out.


{C1T149}
[Sora]
"Yes... Just to be on the safe side, I want you 
all to enter the room."


32 :
The decompression process took place over
several hours.

£o¢o lay on the only bed.

The Kid, Y¤u, Pipi, and I sat next to her.

It was cramped...

We were like sardines in a can. There was
nowhere to move.


33 :
I wondered what time it was...

I took out my PDA and checked.

11:54 p.m....

I was sleepy.

£o¢o was sleeping, and her breathing was
relaxed. It looked like she was doing better.

It didn't look like Y¤u or the Kid were
sleeping, but they sat quietly with their eyes
closed.

Pipi had crawled under the bed.

Sora had sealed the hatch from outside and was
adjusting the pressure as necessary.


34 :
[Takeshi]
"Sora, what about you? Don't you need to be 
treated?"

Before the process had started, I had asked
Sora that.


{C1T150}
[Sora]
No. I'm used to this...


{C1T151}
[Sora]
"Oh, also... Everyone, please remove your voice 
converters during the repressurization process."


{C1T152}
[Sora]
"They are designed to protect your eardrums 
from the change in air pressure; however, 
during pressurization, they can interfere."


35 :
I removed the earphones that I had become
completely used to and held them in my hand.

Sora still stood just outside the hatch window.


Tsugumi... wasn't inside or visible outside
the room. She had left just before the
pressurization process had started.


36 :
{11:0-77}
{11:1}Where did Tsugumi go?

{11:1}When was Sora going to sleep?

{11:2-d0}Maybe £o¢o has some other illness after all?


37 :
Where the heck did Tsugumi go, anyway?

Just before the hatch was closed, she had
suddenly started talking.


38 :

{T1C336}
[Tsugumi]
Uh...


39 :

{T1C337}
[Tsugumi]
I'm leaving.

[Takeshi]
Hey, where are you going?


40 :

{T1C338}
[Tsugumi]
"There... is a place that I just realized I 
need to go to."

[Takeshi]
Where? Treatment is more urgent than that.


41 :

{T1C339}
[Tsugumi]
I don't need it.

[Takeshi]
Tsugumi, that's irresponsible and selfish!


42 :

{T1C340}
[Tsugumi]
"I can't stay cooped up in this cramped 
place..."


{T1C341}
[Tsugumi]
"Well, I won't go escaping alone, so just 
take it easy."

[Takeshi]
That's not the point.

[Tsugumi]
.........


43 :

{T1C342}
[Tsugumi]
"To be blunt, I don't have the patience for 
you. Any of you."

Tsugumi ignored Y¤u and me and went off
somewhere.


44 :
Sora had reported to us that she was
somewhere on the floor and safe...

But it still bothered me a bit.

But it was Tsugumi, after all. I was sure she'd
probably be back in a little while saying
something else.

That was what I thought, but nearly two hours
had passed.

(I'll wait just a little bit longer...)

Even as I thought that, my eyelids got
heavier and heavier.


45 :
When was Sora going to sleep?

This simple doubt jumped into my mind.

She was doing minute, complex work nonstop,
and she was always on her feet.

Maybe she never got tired...

When I spoke with her over the interphone and
asked her if she was alright, she laughed
and said she was just fine.

And she was still standing outside the room
as if she were a sentinel guarding it.

Her back was straight and she never slouched,
always looking like she was at attention.

I wondered if what she had said about being
fine not sleeping days on end was true...

(That really bothers me...)

I thought that I'd follow up on it later.

Even as I thought that, my eyelids got
heavier and heavier.


46 :
(Maybe £o¢o has some other illness after all?)

I couldn't help that doubt from floating
around my head.

I stole a glance at £o¢o's face.

She looked so calm while sleeping...

Two hours since we started repressurization‡Lshe
was recovering well, just as Sora had
said she would. It must've just been the
bends after all.

That is, I had it wrong all along...

But even so, I couldn't help noticing a
strange and uneasy feeling rising in me.

What was going on?

Why was I so convinced that she had some other
illness from the start?

I couldn't figure it out at all.

It was just that something, I didn't know what,
kept whispering in my ear.

'This is no good, this is no good.'

Maybe I was just too tired?

I crouched next to £o¢o and patted her soft
hair.

My eyelids were heavy.


47 :
(But still... Even so...)

(Today... really was... an eventful day...)

With that, I fell asleep.
