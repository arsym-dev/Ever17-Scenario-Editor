1 :

{C5A000}
[Y¤u]
Fraternal twins!?

Y¤u yelped right next to my ear.

[Kid]
"What are you so surprised about? Didn't I 
tell you?"


2 :

{C5A001}
[Y¤u]
"Well, yeah, I'd heard that you and Mayo were 
twins, but..."


{C5A002}
[Y¤u]
"Nothing about fraternal, or identical, or 
anything like that..."

[Kid]
Oh... but, bwahahahahaaa!

I laughed without thinking.


{C5A003}
[Y¤u]
Hm?

Y¤u cocked her head.

[Kid]
Well, of course we're fraternal twins!

[Kid]
I mean, I'm a guy, and Sara's a girl...


{C5A004}
[Y¤u]
So?

[Kid]
"Monozygotic is when one egg is fertilized, 
and then that embryo splits into two."

[Kid]
"So both twins have the exact same genetic 
makeup... That's why they're called identical, 
because they look the same. And of course 
they're the same gender."

[Kid]
"So, for identical twins, you can't have 
anything other than two girls or two boys."

[Kid]
"But dizygotic, on the other hand... is when 
two different eggs are fertilized by 
different sperm."

[Kid]
"So they're two separate entities from the 
beginning, each with a different genetic 
makeup. That way, they may or may not be the 
same gender."

[Kid]
They may not even look much alike.

[Kid]
They're basically just like other siblings.

[Kid]
"So they're more like siblings who happened 
to be in their mother's body and get born 
about the same time."


{C5A005}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm. I get it...


{C5A006}
[Y¤u]
"So... if a boy and a girl are twins... they 
have to be fraternal, not identical?"

[Kid]
Exactly.


{C5A007}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm.


3 :

{C5A008}
[Y¤u]
...So... what were we talking about again?

[Kid]
You forgot?


4 :

{C5A009}
[Y¤u]
Um, ummmm, well...

[Kid]
It started when you said something like...

[Kid]
'So Mayo and you are twins...'

[Kid]
"'But you aren't any good at computers like 
Mayo is.'"

[Kid]
"'In fact, you've got absolutely no aptitude 
for them. Why is that?'"

[Kid]
And then I said...

[Kid]
'Because we're fraternal twins.'


5 :

{C5A010}
[Y¤u]
Ohh! Righhht! I remember now!

Y¤u flailed her limbs around on top of the
ruins.

That was right, Y¤u and I were on the top of the
Lemurian Ruins.

[Kid]
So after all that, do you get it?


{C5A011}
[Y¤u]
...Huh? Get what?

She paused in her flailing.

[Kid]
The reason I'm not good at computers.


{C5A012}
[Y¤u]
Oh, that... It's like this, right?


{C5A013}
[Y¤u]
"Because you and Mayo are as different from 
one another as any other siblings..."


{C5A014}
[Y¤u]
"Unlike identical twins, your genetic 
strengths, characters, or whatever are 
completely different."

[Kid]
Right.

[Kid]
"I'd say that our 'infrared vision' is the 
only inherited trait that we even share."

[Kid]
"Aside from that, I don't think we're very 
much alike."


{C5A015}
[Y¤u]
Hmmm...


{C5A016}
[Y¤u]
"...So... what were we talking about before 
that?"

[Kid]
Ah...

I sighed and started explaining.


6 :
But before that, I needed to explain what
Y¤u and I were doing there.

It went back to that afternoon... (before I
knew my real name).

Sora came out with some information rather
abruptly.


{C5A017}
[Sora]
"Tanaka Yoichi-san passed away seventeen years 
ago."


{C5A018}
[Sora]
"Tanaka Yukie-san passed away fifteen years ago 
as well."

'Yoichi-san' was Y¤u's father, and 'Yukie-san' was her
mother.

Both of Y¤u's parents had passed away.

It was, unfortunately, a fact.

There was proof, including dated mail and
other files.

I had seen them with my own eyes.

But Y¤u still wasn't convinced.

In her heart, she still believed that her
father was alive.

Of course, regarding her mother, she was even
more vehement.


{C5A019}
[Y¤u]
But my mother works at LeMU.


{C5A020}
[Y¤u]
"We were living together until right before 
all of this happened."


{C5A021}
[Y¤u]
There's no way she died fifteen years ago...

It was hard to know what to say... but I
said...

[Kid]
Maybe she wasn't your real mother.

[Kid]
Meaning she might not even be Yukie-san...

Y¤u was shaking her head back and forth as if
to say, 'Impossible.'

After a while, Y¤u spoke as if in a dream.


{C5A022}
[Y¤u]
Aahhh...


{C5A023}
[Y¤u]
If only I could hack into there...


{C5A024}
[Y¤u]
"Then I could find out details, get the whole 
story..."

The 'there' she meant was LeMMIH's high
security data.

All afternoon and into the night, she had
tried to hack her way in but kept getting
rejected at the confirmation point.

She knew the password.

'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.

She kept trying different variations: caps,
lowercase, varying widths, English, German...


She enlisted Sora and Sara's help, and they
tried every possibility they could think
of... but all to no avail.

LeMMIH had built a high, impenetrable castle,
and Y¤u was turned back again and again right
at the gates.

She was stricken with frustration and grief...

Finally, exhausted and at a loss, she found
her way over to the Lemurian Ruins.

.........

By the time I spotted her, she had climbed
all the way to the top.

I sat down beside her. Neither of us spoke.


But from time to time, Y¤u would let out a
sigh like she had thought of something.

Time passed slowly...


{C5A025}
[Y¤u]
Listen, Kid, you get premonitions, right?

After about the 153rd sigh, Y¤u suddenly came
out with that question.


{C5A026}
[Y¤u]
Can you see anything about my parents?

[Kid]
"Well, you know... premonitions... aren't the 
same as seeing into the past..."

[Kid]
"And you're talking about fifteen and seventeen 
years ago..."

[Kid]
"When I was only one, or not even born yet. 
Either way, there's no way I can look that 
far into the past."


{C5A027}
[Y¤u]
You're totally useless...


{C5A028}
[Y¤u]
"Even when Sora and Mayo were killing 
themselves helping me, you were just sitting 
there spaced out."

[Kid]
.........


{C5A029}
[Y¤u]
Hey, that reminds me...


{C5A030}
[Y¤u]
You and Mayo are twins, right?


{C5A031}
[Y¤u]
"But you're not good with computers the way 
she is."


{C5A032}
[Y¤u]
"In fact, you don't have any aptitude with 
them at all. Why is that?"


7 :
[Kid]
That's when I answered.

[Kid]
I said, 'Because we're fraternal twins'.


{C5A033}
[Y¤u]
Whoah! Banana, banaaaaana!


{C5A034}
[Y¤u]
"I remember now... cow cow cow cow... 
rememberember, cow cow cow now..."


{C5A035}
[Y¤u]
Cow cow cow cow, NOW I rememberember!

Y¤u appeared to be malfunctioning.

The harsh reality of things must have been
too cruel for her to bear...

When Sora first told her, Y¤u went hysterical,
almost crazy, and then burst into a sobbing
fit like a child.

Maybe she had cried herself out. Because,
since then, she had seemed much calmer.

But then...


{C5A036}
[Y¤u]
Apo, apo, a pineappo?

She was in bad shape.

[Kid]
Y¤u? Are you okay?


{C5A037}
[Y¤u]
Wazzat?

[Kid]
"Uh, maybe you're a little 
psychologically strained?"


{C5A038}
[Y¤u]
No waaaay, I'm fine!


{C5A039}
[Y¤u]
I'm starting over from here.


{C5A040}
[Y¤u]
No point in moping, right?

[Kid]
.........


{C5A041}
[Y¤u]
Enough about me, how about you, Hokutan?

[Kid]
Ho-Hokutan!?


{C5A042}
[Y¤u]
Your name's Hokuto, right...? So... Hokutan.

[Kid]
Cut it out, don't call me that.


{C5A043}
[Y¤u]
Why not?

[Kid]
"I... still can't think of myself as a 
'Hokuto'."

[Kid]
"If I was walking down the street and someone 
called out, 'Hokuto!'..."

[Kid]
"I wouldn't turn around. In fact, I don't think 
I COULD."

[Kid]
"It wouldn't seem like they were calling out 
to ME..."


{C5A044}
[Y¤u]
"Well, even if that's what you think, that's 
just too bad."


{C5A045}
[Y¤u]
"Your name is 'Hokuto' until you die, and you're 
just going to have to live with that."

[Kid]
But...

[Kid]
"If nothing else, I don't want you guys here 
to call me 'Hokuto'."

[Kid]
"I'm used to being called 'Kid', and you guys 
are used to it too, right?"

[Kid]
"You can't just switch in the middle like 
that."


{C5A046}
[Y¤u]
Well, I suppose, but still...


{C5A047}
[Y¤u]
You really want to stay 'Kid'?

[Kid]
Yeah, that's fine.

I told her how I felt.


{C5A048}
[Y¤u]
You really hate 'Hokuto' that much?

[Kid]
Listen! For the millionth time...

[Kid]
I just don't think that 'Hokuto' is MY name...

[Kid]
"It's got nothing to do with liking or 
disliking the name."


{C5A049}
[Y¤u]
Reeeally...

[Kid]
"Look, I said this when we were talking about 
Ling Ling and Lang Lang, but..."

[Kid]
I really don't care what my name is.

[Kid]
"I'm not fussy, and I'm certainly not attached 
to it."


{C5A050}
[Y¤u]
But you can't NOT care at all.


{C5A051}
[Y¤u]
"Whether you like it or not, a name is like a 
billboard for who you are."


{C5A052}
[Y¤u]
"If you're going to live in a society, you'll 
need a name eventually."


{C5A053}
[Y¤u]
"I mean, any time that you make a contract, 
or apply for something, take an exam, or 
get arrested..."


{C5A054}
[Y¤u]
"Whatever you say, your name is the most 
important way to verify who you are."


{C5A055}
[Y¤u]
Names are like ID numbers for people.

[Kid]
Identification...


8 :
The word just slipped out.

And then!


9 :

{C5A056}
[Y¤u]
What!? What'd you just say!?

Y¤u grabbed the back of my head and pulled my
face toward hers.

[Kid]
Wha-wha-wha-what...?


{C5A057}
[Y¤u]
"Just then! Just now! Now, now, now! Kid, 
what did you just say!?"

[Kid]
I didn't say anything...

[Kid]
I just repeated back what you were saying...

Y¤u leveled a determined glare at me.


She raised her finger and twirled it like a
magic wand.

She breathed in through her nose.

I thought she was going to exhale, but
she continued to take one long breath in.

I covered my ears.

She grabbed my hands and pulled them away
from my ears.

And then...

With all the air she had just sucked in, she
let loose right next to me.


10 :

{C5A058}
[Y¤u]
I've GOT it!

She grinned loosely.

[Kid]
?

I just kept blinking at her.

And then...


{C5A059}
[Y¤u]
"I gawt it, I gawt it, I got it got it got 
it~"


{C5A060}
[Y¤u]
<I see, I see>, I sincerely LOVE you! Smooooch~

Suddenly, out of the blue and with no
warning‡Lshe kissed my cheek.

A perfect hit.

I was a little... giddy...


{C5A061}
[Y¤u]
Well, hurry up, ask me!

[Kid]
...Ask?


{C5A062}
[Y¤u]
"Come on, ask me, 'Hey, Y¤u, what did you 
figure out?'"

I did as I was told.

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u, what did you figure out?


{C5A063}
[Y¤u]
Funny you should ask, Kid!


{C5A064}
[Y¤u]
"You see, you know the reason we couldn't get 
past the confirmation on LeMMIH? I figured 
it out!"

[Kid]
?


{C5A065}
[Y¤u]
"All this time, we thought we had the password 
wrong. Right?"


{C5A066}
[Y¤u]
But that wasn't it.


{C5A067}
[Y¤u]
The password is probably fine.


{C5A068}
[Y¤u]
The empty fall sky{1}A single cuckoo calls out{1}Brings a chill to me'.

[Kid]
Huh? What do you mean?


{C5A069}
[Y¤u]
So, it's gotta be this...


{C5A070}
[Y¤u]
"It wasn't the password we had wrong... it was 
the username."

[Kid]
Username?


{C5A071}
[Y¤u]
Yup.


{C5A072}
[Y¤u]
"A name is like an identification number for a 
person... It's what confirms who you are..."


{C5A073}
[Y¤u]
"So, if we had the name wrong, it wouldn't 
matter how perfectly we put the password in."

'Access denied. Invalid name or password.'

I had seen that message umpteen times.


{C5A074}
[Y¤u]
"If you were right, and the mother I know 
isn't really my mother..."


{C5A075}
[Y¤u]
It means her real name isn't 'Tanaka Yukie'.


{C5A076}
[Y¤u]
Which would mean...?

[Kid]
"If you just knew her real name, you could 
clear LeMMIH's confirmation?"


{C5A077}
[Y¤u]
Exactly!

Y¤u tapped my forehead.

[Kid]
But... how will you figure out her real name?


{C5A078}
[Y¤u]
Well...


{C5A079}
[Y¤u]
Sora ought to know, right?

Before I could say, 'Sora?', Y¤u had grabbed my
arms.

A second later...


{C5A080}
[Y¤u]
Aaaaiii!

She jumped down off the ruins with a great cry.


11 :
Pulled off balance, I flew clumsily through
the air.


12 :
‡LBam!

I nearly toppled onto my head but managed to
right myself like a cat and landed safely.

My own excellent reflexes impressed me.

As for Y¤u...

She was sprawled on her belly in a puddle,
arms and legs spread awkwardly.

[Kid]
Y¤u? Y¤u! You okay?

When I called her name, Y¤u hopped up.


13 :
Water dripped from her hair.


She was soaked from head to toe.


{C5A081}
[Y¤u]
Well, don't just stand there, let's go!

She spoke calmly.


14 :
Flinging off water, she headed toward the exit.

From the back, she looked completely dry.


15 :
.........

......

...

I stood for a minute in front of the gates of
the Lemurian Ruins, just thinking.


{C5A074}
[Y¤u]
"If you were right, and the mother I know 
isn't really my mother..."


{C5A075}
[Y¤u]
It means her real name isn't 'Tanaka Yukie'.

So what was her name then...?

Name... Name... Name...

Y¤u's real name was Yubiseiakikana...


16 :
[Kid]
...Aki?

Aki... Autumn... Autumn...

'The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me'.

I broke it down by character.
Empty... Fall... Sky... Single...
Cuckoo... Calling... Brings... Chill...

A jumble of bits and illogical fragments.

I tried to form them into a coherent pattern,
but they slipped away.

I couldn't grasp them.

But I couldn't help but feel that I had
brushed up against another premonition, or at
least an intuition...

It was a haiku. Seventeen syllables.

I muttered it out loud.

[Kid]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me."

[Kid]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me."

It was then...

Someone was standing in the darkness beyond
the entrance to the ruins.

A human figure...

A female...

Her body was giving off heat, glowing redder
than red.

I couldn't see her face.

I could just see that she was there.

She was holding her breath in the darkness,
staring at me.

[Kid]
Wh-who are you!?

She didn't answer.

She didn't come any closer, but she didn't
seem like she was going to run.

The figure bathed in light looked like she
might be a ghost.

A ghost...

A phantom girl...


{C5A082}
[???]
Hokuto...

I heard a tiny voice.

'Hokuto'... My name...

Was she calling to me...?


{C5A083}
[???]
Hokuto...

Fearfully, I went a little closer.

The darkness grew deeper.

And at the same time, the light she gave off
grew more brilliant.

Her outline sprang into view.

It had to be...

She... She was... the ghost... I had seen...


{C5A084}
[???]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A lone Hokuto calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me."


17 :

{C5A085}
[£o¢o]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me."

[Takeshi]
...Huh?


18 :

{C5A086}
[£o¢o]
Hm?

[Takeshi]
What did you just say?


{C5A087}
[£o¢o]
"The empty fall sky{1}
A single cuckoo calls out{1}
Brings a chill to me?"

[Takeshi]
What is that...?

[Takeshi]
Is that some haiku?


{C5A088}
[£o¢o]
Yeah.

[Takeshi]
Why a haiku all of a sudden...?


19 :

{C5A089}
[£o¢o]
Don't you think it's elegant?

[Takeshi]
Elegant?


{C5A090}
[£o¢o]
Refined, isn't it?

[Takeshi]
Refined?


20 :

{C5A091}
[£o¢o]
"Japanese people a long time ago just 
started making up haiku one day."


{C5A092}
[£o¢o]
So you see...


21 :

{C5A093}
[£o¢o]
"The haiku helped them to forget their 
everyday worries and gave them lots of 
graceful and happy, happy feelings."

[Takeshi]
Oho... Is that so...?


{C5A094}
[£o¢o]
Oho, yes it is.

[Takeshi]
"But listen, £o¢o... It's not once upon a time 
right now, and..."

[Takeshi]
"You kind of threw me off guard with your 
haiku-making there."


22 :

{C5A095}
[£o¢o]
Well I can't help it.

[Takeshi]
What do you mean you can't help it?


{C5A096}
[£o¢o]
I wasn't talking to you.

[Takeshi]
What?


{C5A097}
[£o¢o]
"I was talking to a life form from another 
dimension."

[Takeshi]
A-another dimension!?


23 :

{C5A098}
[£o¢o]
Well, yeah?

Apparently, £o¢o was radiating microwaves.


Oh, my head... My head...

I could feel my brain start to melt and
come out of my nose...

‡LWhat!? Wait a minute!

My brain couldn't be coming out of my nose!

I rubbed my nose with my finger.

Something sticky and viscous was stuck to my
finger. It was bright yellow.

[Takeshi]
Craaaaaaaaaaaap!

[Takeshi]
"Crap, crap, my brain, my brain, my brain 
is meltiiiing!"


24 :

{C5A099}
[£o¢o]
Kyahahahaha~

[Takeshi]
Shut up, it's not funny, stupiiid!

[Takeshi]
"It's your fault, it's your fault, that my 
brain, my brain..."


{C5A100}
[£o¢o]
Neeeeheeeheeee!

£o¢o was stamping her feet, grabbing her
belly, and laughing uproariously.

(Hey... Actually...)


25 :
It had all happened 30 minutes earlier.


{C5A101}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon, Takepyon~


{C5A102}
[£o¢o]
Wake up~


{C5A103}
[£o¢o]
I can't go to sleep~


{C5A104}
[£o¢o]
Come play with me~

While saying that...

She was shaking me, grasping my eyelids, and
dropping in 'mermaid tears', as well as squirting
mustard up my nose.

Giving in to her dogged persistence, I
reluctantly decided to keep her company.


26 :
Which meant... it wasn't brain soup...

[Takeshi]
It's mustard.


27 :

{C5A105}
[£o¢o]
Bwaahaaahyahyahyahya~

£o¢o toppled over, right into a puddle.

Splashing the water around, she kept laughing
and rolling back and forth.

[Takeshi]
Damn it!

[Takeshi]
£o¢o, don't you have a tissue?


28 :

{C5A106}
[£o¢o]
I have a ha-ha-ha-handkerchief!

She pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket
and fluttered it at me.

The handkerchief was soaked, and drops of
water dripped from it.


29 :
I blew my nose into it mightily.

I blew until I blew out everything there was
to blow.

[Takeshi]
Whew, that's better.

I balled it up and gave it back to £o¢o.

She carefully folded it up and put it back in
her pocket.

I thought‡L'You're actually putting that
back!?'‡Lbut held my tongue.

[Takeshi]
...So...? What were we talking about?


30 :

{C5A107}
[£o¢o]
About caterpillar crawling, crawling.

[Takeshi]
No we weren't!


31 :

{C5A108}
[£o¢o]
Caterpillar, caterpillar, crawly crawly caterpillar~


{C5A109}
[£o¢o]
Caterpillar, caterpillar, boop boop de boop~

£o¢o began crawling along the floor flat on her
belly.

I didn't say a word...


32 :

{C5A110}
[£o¢o]
Hey Takepyon, Takepyon!

[Takeshi]
I'm not playing caterpillar with you!


33 :

{C5A111}
[£o¢o]
What!? Why not!?

[Takeshi]
I'm just not.


34 :

{C5A112}
[£o¢o]
No no no no no no!


{C5A113}
[£o¢o]
I wanna crawly, I wanna crawlypillar!

£o¢o splashed at the water.

(I went through this last night...)


'There's NO way I'm making the same mistake
today'‡LI swore that to myself.

[Takeshi]
I'm going to bed.


35 :

{C5A114}
[£o¢o]
Whaaat!?

She jumped up.

And clung to me, sopping wet.


{C5A115}
[£o¢o]
No! I won't let you sleep!

[Takeshi]
£o¢o, I'm sleeping whether you let me or not.


36 :

{C5A116}
[£o¢o]
Why are you being so mean...?

[Takeshi]
You're the one being mean, £o¢o.


{C5A117}
[£o¢o]
Oo... Oooo...


37 :

{C5A118}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon... Takepyon... is just gonna abandon 
poor little £o¢o?"


{C5A119}
[£o¢o]
I'll be all alone...


{C5A120}
[£o¢o]
Lonely... So lonely...

[Takeshi]
Why are you being like this...?

[Takeshi]
Why don't you come sleep too?


38 :

{C5A121}
[£o¢o]
With you...?


{C5A122}
[£o¢o]
You'll come snuggle with me?

[Takeshi]
.........

[£o¢o]
.........

[Takeshi]
..................

[£o¢o]
..................

[Takeshi]
I don't think so.

{C5A123}
[£o¢o]
"Well, well, will you at least sing me a 
lullaby?"

[Takeshi]
A lullaby?

[Takeshi]
Oh, you mean... that one you sang before?


40 :

{C5A124}
[£o¢o]
Yup~

[Takeshi]
Well, I don't mind singing, but...

[Takeshi]
I don't remember the words or the tune.


41 :

{C5A125}
[£o¢o]
That's okay.


{C5A126}
[£o¢o]
It's easy, you'll learn it right away.


42 :
With that said...

She burst into song abruptly.


43 :

{C5A127}
[£o¢o]
Moon sprite... shouldering a long bow...


{C5A128}
[£o¢o]
Waiting... inside a dream...


44 :

{C5A129}
[£o¢o]
Tonight... a story by moonlight...


{C5A130}
[£o¢o]
Hoping the wait... will be short...


{C5A131}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping... curled and snug...


{C5A132}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping... in mother's arms...


45 :

{C5A133}
[£o¢o]
Water sprite... lifting a pair of paddles...


{C5A134}
[£o¢o]
Waiting... inside a dream...


{C5A135}
[£o¢o]
"Tonight, the whirlpool demon... 
waiting for a boat..."


{C5A136}
[£o¢o]
Hoping the wait... will be short...


{C5A137}
[£o¢o]
Rock, rock, rocked... to sleep...


{C5A138}
[£o¢o]
Sleeping, sleeping... held by the ocean...


46 :
What was it...?

As soon as I heard £o¢o's lullaby, I felt a
wondrous tranquility.

I felt a tickle in my chest, like someone had
blown lightly on me.

That breath blew away all the dust and dirt
that had built up inside me, and it revealed
precious feelings I had thought lost long ago.

Precious wonder... like the vastness of the
sky, as it seemed to me when I was a little
child, or the deep blue waves, or the
fragrance at twilight...

Back then, I thought the ocean went on
forever, and I was transfixed by the perfect
beauty of the moon.

For better or for worse, a delightfully sweet
time...

£o¢o's lullaby called up a sentimental mood
in me.

Lost in its sweet fragrance, I made the
mistake of drowning in it.

[Takeshi]
What a good song...


{C5A139}
[£o¢o]
Ehe~

[Takeshi]
What's it called?


47 :

{C5A140}
[£o¢o]
Who knows? I don't know its name...


{C5A141}
[£o¢o]
"But I just call it the Moon and Ocean 
Lullaby."

[Takeshi]
Moon and ocean?

[Takeshi]
"But don't the verses start with 'moon sprite' 
and 'water sprite'?"


{C5A142}
[£o¢o]
Mm-hmmm.

[Takeshi]
"So shouldn't it be the Moon and Water 
Lullaby?"


{C5A143}
[£o¢o]
Ummm...


{C5A144}
[£o¢o]
"But at the end of the second verse, it says 
'held by the ocean', right?"

[Takeshi]
Oh, that's true...


{C5A145}
[£o¢o]
And... my mommy taught me this lullaby...


{C5A146}
[£o¢o]
So... it's called 'The Moon and Ocean Lullaby'.

[Takeshi]
What?

What was the connection between her mom and
the moon and ocean?

‡LWhat!?

Mommy!? Moon and sea!?

Did that mean...

[Takeshi]
When you say mommy...


{C5A147}
[£o¢o]
Right. Tsugumin.


{C5A148}
[£o¢o]
Tsugumin...


48 :

{C5A149}
[£o¢o]
She would sing it to me.

[Kid]
Tsu-Tsugumi!?

[Kid]
That's... crazy...

[Kid]
That's impossible!

[Kid]
"Because... no one knows that lullaby except Sara 
and me..."


49 :

{C5A150}
[£o¢o]
Hahahahaha~

[Kid]
Why...? Why... are you laughing?


50 :

{C5A151}
[£o¢o]
"Hokutan? Don't you think it's strange, what 
you're saying?"

[Kid]
What!?


{C5A152}
[£o¢o]
Right now, you're a little confused.


{C5A153}
[£o¢o]
So you showed your true self for a minute.


{C5A154}
[£o¢o]
"The real you decided to poke his face out 
for a teensy-weensy second."

[Kid]
?


{C5A155}
[£o¢o]
Listen, Hokutan. Think about it.


{C5A156}
[£o¢o]
"It's not really that strange for Tsugumin to 
know that lullaby, right?"


{C5A157}
[£o¢o]
"Mayo-chan could have just taught it to Tsugumin, 
right?"


{C5A158}
[£o¢o]
And then Tsugumin taught it to me...

[Kid]
That's not possible!


{C5A159}
[£o¢o]
What makes you say that?

[Kid]
Because... Because...


{C5A160}
[£o¢o]
Maybe you can't answer that?

[Kid]
.........


{C5A161}
[£o¢o]
Well then, I'll just answer for you.


{C5A162}
[£o¢o]
"You see, Hokutan, you know that Mayo-chan doesn't 
exist in the world I live in."


{C5A163}
[£o¢o]
That's why you just said, 'That's not possible!'


{C5A164}
[£o¢o]
"And that's the reason you thought that there 
was no way that Tsugumin could know that song."


{C5A165}
[£o¢o]
Right?

[Kid]
What!? What!? What!?


{C5A166}
[£o¢o]
It's okay, you don't have to be scared!


{C5A167}
[£o¢o]
Just be honest with your feelings, okay?


{C5A168}
[£o¢o]
There's no reason for you to lie anymore.

I was getting more and more confused.

I was being gobbled up by one problem after
another, being chewed up for sport, and I
felt like I was losing myself.

I squeezed my eyes shut, took a big breath,
and tried to maintain a grip on reality.

I opened my eyes, stared at £o¢o, and asked...

[Kid]
"Um... 'The world I live in'... What does that 
mean?"


51 :

{C5A169}
[£o¢o]
See now, there you go, lying again~


52 :

{C5A170}
[£o¢o]
You know aaaaall about the world I'm in, right?


{C5A171}
[£o¢o]
"Mayo-chan's not there, and Tsugumin got hurt,
and there's another you with a different face..."


{C5A172}
[£o¢o]
You know ALL that stuff.

The world £o¢o was in...

Another self...

Tsugumi injured...

Where there was no Sara...

...What...? A world without Sara?

[Kid]
"That's right! Hang on! Why do you know 
about Sara!?"


53 :

{C5A173}
[£o¢o]
"Hm? Are you fiiiinally ready to come clean, 
hmmm?"


{C5A174}
[£o¢o]
Okay then, I'll tell you.


54 :

{C5A175}
[£o¢o]
It's because... I know everything.


{C5A176}
[£o¢o]
I know everything, so I know about Mayo-chan.


{C5A177}
[£o¢o]
And the reason for that is... I have ESP.


55 :

{C5A178}
[£o¢o]
Uheeheeheehee~

[Kid]
Stop trying to mess with me!


{C5A179}
[£o¢o]
I'm not... It's true!


56 :

{C5A180}
[£o¢o]
"Okay, lemme ask you a question then. Hokutan,
how come you know about me? Why DID 
you know about me?"


{C5A181}
[£o¢o]
"That first time, when we met in the 
decompression chamber, you said my name, 
didn't you? And why would that be?"

[Kid]
"It was... sort of like a premonition, an 
insight..."


{C5A182}
[£o¢o]
Uh-hunh...


{C5A183}
[£o¢o]
Well, what about Pipi?

[Kid]
What!?


{C5A184}
[£o¢o]
You know about Pipi, don't you, Hokutan?

[Kid]
No, I have no idea...


57 :

{C5A185}
[£o¢o]
Oh? That's funny...


58 :

{C5A186}
[£o¢o]
Well, Pipi is this little kitten I have...

[Kid]
‡LA cat!?


59 :

{C5A187}
[£o¢o]
Nyahaaaahaahaaaa~


{C5A188}
[£o¢o]
Gotcha, I gotcha, you fell for it!


60 :

{C5A189}
[£o¢o]
"When I said 'kitten' just then, you did a 
double take! Right!?"


61 :

{C5A190}
[£o¢o]
Why would that surprise you? Hm?

[Kid]
.........


{C5A191}
[£o¢o]
"Because you know that Pipi is really a dog! 
That's why!"

[Kid]
.........


{C5A192}
[£o¢o]
Stop acting. And stop playing dumb.


{C5A193}
[£o¢o]
You've known about my world aaallll along.


{C5A194}
[£o¢o]
That's why you know everything.


{C5A195}
[£o¢o]
"Tief Blau virus... Curé virus... 
IBF... Pygmalion... The terabyte disc..."


{C5A196}
[£o¢o]
"All of them, all of them! You've heard all 
of those words before, haven't you?"

[Kid]
.........


{C5A197}
[£o¢o]
And this, this, I bet you remember this...


{C5A198}
[£o¢o]
"How you and Mayo-chan escaped from 34 meters
deep down under the sea..."


{C5A199}
[£o¢o]
How you escaped with Nakkyu using a siphon...


{C5A200}
[£o¢o]
"Don't lie and say you forgot. I know you 
remember."

[Kid]
.........


{C5A201}
[£o¢o]
I'm the same as you.


{C5A202}
[£o¢o]
"That's why I know about the world you live 
in and the world I live in."


{C5A203}
[£o¢o]
So? Do you understand now?

[Kid]
.........


{C5A204}
[£o¢o]
I know everything you know.


{C5A205}
[£o¢o]
And, and...


{C5A206}
[£o¢o]
I know some things that you don't know yet.


{C5A207}
[£o¢o]
"Things you don't know yet means... things you 
will come to know later."

[Kid]
.........


{C5A208}
[£o¢o]
But...


62 :

{C5A209}
[£o¢o]
"Maybe I'm telling you way too much stuff, so 
your mind is getting all mixed up."


63 :

{C5A210}
[£o¢o]
"But I can tell you that you'll understand it 
one day..."


{C5A211}
[£o¢o]
So... I'll say it again...


{C5A212}
[£o¢o]
You absolutely can't lie to yourself, okay?


{C5A213}
[£o¢o]
Okay? Understand?

[Kid]
"I don't... I don't underst... Of course I don't 
understand!"


64 :

{C5A214}
[£o¢o]
*Sigh*... Here we go again...

[Kid]
£o¢o... £o¢o... What are you!?

[Kid]
Why did you suddenly appear in front of me!?


65 :
At those words, £o¢o's face suddenly clouded
over.

She scrunched up her face and drew her
eyebrows together.

Tears welled up in her eyes.

She blinked to hide them and spoke quietly.


{C5A215}
[£o¢o]
I wanted... to see you.


{C5A216}
[£o¢o]
I've been... waiting for you.


{C5A217}
[£o¢o]
Waiting and waiting for you to come...


{C5A218}
[£o¢o]
I wanted to see you... more than anything...


{C5A219}
[£o¢o]
I wanted to see you again...


{C5A220}
[£o¢o]
"I've been waiting here by myself... All by 
myself..."

£o¢o's words drifted into my heart and
melted like a light snow.

We gazed at each other without speaking.

It wasn't what the words said, so much as
that she said them at all, that moved me so
deeply.

Before I sought their meaning, I let the
simple power of her true feelings flow
straight into my trembling heart.

I couldn't take my eyes off of £o¢o's sad,
tear-filled eyes.

[£o¢o]
.........

[Kid]
.........


66 :
£o¢o laughed softly.

I could tell it was forced cheer.

The bravery of that laugh gripped at my heart.


{C5A221}
[£o¢o]
I'm sorry, I have to go.


67 :

{C5A222}
[£o¢o]
We'll be apart again for a little while.

[Kid]
What?


{C5A223}
[£o¢o]
"Okay, before I go, I'll tell you something 
pretty juicy."


{C5A224}
[£o¢o]
"But I'm pretty sure you've already figured 
it out..."

[Kid]
...?


{C5A225}
[£o¢o]
Hokutan, that dream you saw, it wasn't a dream.


{C5A226}
[£o¢o]
It actually happened, okay?


{C5A227}
[£o¢o]
Don't forget what I just said, alright?

[Kid]
.........


68 :

{C5A228}
[£o¢o]
See you later, Hokutan.


69 :
The next moment, she was gone.

Without a sound, just... gone, like a candle
snuffed out by a wandering night draft...

And then I lost consciousness.


70 :
I sank down into the darkness for a minute.

(Pull yourself together, man!)

I shook my head and gathered my wits.


71 :

{C5A229}
[£o¢o]
"It's the £o¢o-chan show! First skit‡LWhat if a 
dolphin were salmon roe..."


{C5A230}
[£o¢o]
'Wow, big load today, tons of salmon!'


{C5A231}
[£o¢o]
'Let's see, open 'em up...'


{C5A232}
[£o¢o]
'Cut... Cut...'


{C5A233}
[£o¢o]
"'Whoah, what's this!? Dolphins are pouring 
out of the salmon! Hundreds of them!'"


{C5A234}
[£o¢o]
'Oh no! Oh no! Mom! Mommy! Emergency!'


{C5A235}
[£o¢o]
Bwahahahaha~


{C5A236}
[£o¢o]
Heeheeheehee~

The reason I had blacked out must have been
£o¢o's microwaves. They got me.

I still hadn't built up immunity to them...
It was pretty rough.

Why didn't I ever learn? Why was it that
every time I wandered around, my feet kept
taking me to her?

It was strange.

I wondered if she was drawing me to her with
some mysterious frequency.


Anyway...

Having finished breakfast, I wandered around
LeMU and got sucked into the souvenir shops.



{C5A237}
[£o¢o]
£o¢o-chan's jokes‡LIf a dolphin... was a corpse!


{C5A238}
[£o¢o]
'Oh, thank you for coming such a long way...'


{C5A239}
[£o¢o]
'My sincere condolences...'


{C5A240}
[£o¢o]
'Would you like to see my husband's face?'


{C5A241}
[£o¢o]
'Oh, well, certainly...'


{C5A242}
[£o¢o]
'Click... Click...'


{C5A243}
[£o¢o]
"'Whoah! An eternally sleeping dolphin! And 
it's belly-up, too!'"


{C5A244}
[£o¢o]
"'He looks so peaceful... as if he'd jump up 
any second...' Except you couldn't say that, 
because you wouldn't be able to see his 
face!"


{C5A245}
[£o¢o]
Bwahahahaha~


{C5A246}
[£o¢o]
Heeheeheehee~

£o¢o pattered along, shaking a huge stuffed
dolphin.

Several smaller stuffed animals were strewn
around the carpet.

From the looks of the empty cabinet nearby, it
appeared that she had pulled them all down
from their places on the shelf.

It was such a childish thing to do.

A child...

But £o¢o was fourteen.

A fourteen-year-old who still played with stuffed
animals...

I wondered if it was really alright to let
her just grow up like that?

But when I saw her innocent, laughing face, I
didn't have the heart to scold her.

I supposed she would probably be happiest
just being the way she was.


£o¢o continued to crack herself up... and
I... continued to watch...

When her amusement died down a little, I
called to her.

[Takeshi]
Hey, £o¢o? Where's Pipi?


{C5A247}
[£o¢o]
"Pipi? I think he's right over there 
somewhere..."

I looked around the kiosk.


{PIPI_23}
[Pipi]
*Wooo*... *Wooo*... *Woo*...!

There.

Pipi was gripping a stuffed animal's tail in
his teeth, shaking it back and forth crazily.

It was a stuffed lemur doll. He seemed
completely engrossed in it.


{C5A248}
[£o¢o]
Hey, Takepyon, what'cha doin' over there?

[Takeshi]
Hm? What am I doing, huh?

[Takeshi]
"You look so happy that just watching you is 
making me happy..."

[Takeshi]
"So I guess you could say that by watching 
you, I've slipped into a happy, stupid 
state..."


{C5A249}
[£o¢o]
Ehe~


{C5A250}
[£o¢o]
"Takepyon, you're falling in love with me, 
aren't you?"

[Takeshi]
...What?


{C5A251}
[£o¢o]
You like me, you like me, don't you!


{C5A252}
[£o¢o]
"Wow~ I can't believe it~ He's finally told 
me how he feels~"


{C5A253}
[£o¢o]
How embarrassing~ I'm blushing~


{C5A254}
[£o¢o]
"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! A crush! What'll I 
do?"

‡LBam! Bam!

£o¢o balled up her fists and started popping
the dolphin's belly with brutal right hooks.

Punch after punch. Again and again.

Until the cotton started to come out...


{C5A255}
[£o¢o]
Well, to thank you...


{C5A256}
[£o¢o]
Shall I tell you a new joke?

[Takeshi]
Aw, no, that's okay...


{C5A257}
[£o¢o]
Why not!? You don't have to be polite!

[Takeshi]
Oh, believe me, I'm not being...


{C5A258}
[£o¢o]
£o¢o-chan's joke‡Labout the doctor and the nurse.

Ignoring my pleas, £o¢o launched into her
joke.


72 :
.........

......

...

It was very long.

It was not funny.

It was so bad, in fact, that I couldn't even
muster a polite chuckle.

It went like so...



73 :
A nurse named Kate was desperately in love
with Robert, a doctor who worked at the same
hospital.

Robert was crazy about Kate as well.

Kate stood on the left side of the room, and
Robert stood on the right.

Kate slipped out of her white uniform and
hung it on the closet door.

{16:4}

74 :
Robert stripped his uniform off in a bit of a
hurry and simply dropped it on the floor.

Kate lowered her panties. Robert threw off
his boxers.

Kate's body was lovely and supple, and Robert
was lean and muscled.

Kate put on the silk pajamas she had bought
for the occasion.

Still naked, Robert turned off the light.

{16:4}

75 :
Standing on the left of the bed, Kate turned
slowly to the right.

On the right of the bed, Robert turned easily
to the left...

And they jumped into the bed and... slept.


Oh, by the way, Kate was sleeping in the
night duty room, and Robert was sleeping in
his room at home.

{16:4}

76 :
'Hey, what's with the face?'

'Haaa, I bet you were imagining something
dirty, weren't you!'

That was the punch line.

{16:4}

77 :

{C5A259}
[£o¢o]
Heeheehehehehe~

£o¢o's laugh was loud enough to hear across
the Pacific Ocean.

If there were any nuclear submarines nearby,
their sonar guys were probably laughing too.


Even I felt the corners of my mouth twitching.


Obviously, the joke wasn't funny.


But £o¢o was so amused at the unamusing
joke that it was hilarious.

All was well...

I thought that to myself.

According to what we heard from Sora on the
second day, LeMU's partitions would reach
their structural limit in only one more day.

So how was it that I felt so calm?


Maybe £o¢o's innocence was contagious...


I wasn't even tense. I was lounging around.

If I stayed like that, it could be dangerous.

It was fine for £o¢o to be innocent, but if I
got swept away in it, it could be fatal.


The thought ran through my head, but as I
looked at her smiling face, I couldn't hold
onto caution.

It was too peaceful...

It was like being in a dream.


78 :
I was in a dream.

After £o¢o disappeared, I blacked out.

Maybe I was still stuck in that state.

In the dream, I felt choked and oppressed.


It was like being plastered up inside thick
walls...

Unable to move, only my eyes could follow the
images before me...

I earnestly followed after the fragments of
scenes that unfolded before me.


{C5A225}
[£o¢o]
Hokutan, that dream you saw, it wasn't a dream.


{C5A226}
[£o¢o]
It actually happened, okay?

I thought about it.

That dream?

The dream I had on the third day, right before
I woke up?


{C5A170}
[£o¢o]
You know aaaaall about the world I'm in, right?


{C5A171}
[£o¢o]
"Mayo-chan's not there, and Tsugumin got hurt,
and there's another you with a different face..."

Tsugumi... injured...

Meaning it had actually happened?

But no, it couldn't be...

The warehouse was still fine...

And Tsugumi was as perky as ever...

What could it mean?


{C5A212}
[£o¢o]
You absolutely can't lie to yourself, okay?

£o¢o's words ran together.

The scattered fragments of images began to
come together a little, until I could make
out a vague outline.

But I still couldn't see the whole picture at
once.

It was like a freakishly large mural.

Since I was imprisoned in those walls, there
was no way to see the whole thing.

What to do...?

Escape from those walls...

Escape from those walls......

When I pushed my face out through the wall‡L


79 :
‡LI woke up.

I was in the infirmary.

I looked around.

I was alone.


80 :
I ran out of the infirmary and headed toward
Dritter Stock.


81 :
(If £o¢o was right, and there really had been
an accident, and Tsugumi was injured...)

In any case, I would find Tsugumi and
discover the truth for myself.

But I didn't know where Tsugumi was.


82 :
So I headed to the control room first.


Sora was sure to be there...

And Sora would know where Tsugumi was.

I opened the door.


83 :
[Kid]
Sora! Where's Tsugumi right now!?

I ran into the room and yelled in a loud voice.


84 :

{C5A260}
[Sora]
What?


{C5A261}
[Sora]
Komachi-san is right here...


85 :
Sure enough, there she was.

Tsugumi, on a chair, turned around to me.


86 :

{C5A262}
[Tsugumi]
What happened? Why are you in such a hurry...?

[Kid]
I... Uh... Well...

[Kid]
Tsugumi, look, sorry, but...!

On the spur of the moment, I lifted up
Tsugumi's skirt.


87 :

{C5A263}
[Tsugumi]
Hey! What are you doing!?


88 :
‡LSmack!


89 :
A resounding slap...

But it didn't hurt.

As a matter of fact, I seemed to have lost all
feeling in my entire body.

Because I had seen...

On Tsugumi's right thigh... a faint scar...


[Kid]
Wha-wha-what is that scar...!?


90 :

{C5A264}
[Tsugumi]
Scar?

[Kid]
The scar on your thigh!


{C5A265}
[Tsugumi]
This...


91 :

{C5A266}
[Tsugumi]
This is just an old scar...

[Kid]
Old scar!?

[Kid]
From when!?


{C5A267}
[Tsugumi]
Oh, a long time ago...


{C5A268}
[Tsugumi]
A really, really long time ago.

[Kid]
Where!? Where did you get hurt!?


{C5A269}
[Tsugumi]
It was...


92 :
I was trapped in a gondola. I couldn't move.


I couldn't even shift my eyes.

Past the skirt I was holding, I could see the
white of her panties.

The smooth curve of her thigh.

Her smooth, silky skin.

‡LThe scar.

There was definitely a scar there.

But...

It looked like something that had healed
years ago, leaving only the faint mark of
stitches that once closed a wound.


93 :

{T5A100}
[Tsugumi]
"Twelve years ago, I was infected with a 
virus."


{T5A101}
[Tsugumi]
Because of that virus... The virus...


{T5A102}
[Tsugumi]
It rewrote my genetic code.


{T5A103}
[Tsugumi]
Cells are reborn every day.


{T5A104}
[Tsugumi]
They are reborn and then die.


{T5A105}
[Tsugumi]
"Normally, the human body is totally replaced 
with new cells within five years."


{T5A106}
[Tsugumi]
"When I was twelve, the cells in my body were 
infected. And from that moment on, they 
divided and replaced themselves..."


{T5A107}
[Tsugumi]
"Five years later, all cells had been 
replaced."


{T5A108}
[Tsugumi]
"In five years, every cell that made up 
my body had been genetically altered."


{T5A109}
[Tsugumi]
And when the last of the cells had died...


{T5A110}
[Tsugumi]
"The last trace of my twelve-year-old self 
disappeared."


{T5A111}
[Tsugumi]
In that moment, the old me died.


{T5A112}
[Tsugumi]
"The old me died, but the new me became a body 
that never dies."


{T5A113}
[Tsugumi]
"My immune system and my metabolic 
rate were remarkably improved..."


{T5A114}
[Tsugumi]
"My telomeres began to regenerate 
themselves..."


{T5A115}
[Tsugumi]
That's right...


{T5A116}
[Tsugumi]
I will never grow old and never die.


{T5A117}
[Tsugumi]
"My physical growth stopped at that 
moment in time."


{T5A118}
[Tsugumi]
I'll never grow older than seventeen.


94 :
'The Curé virus'

The Curé virus is a type of retrovirus.


Like many retroviruses, the Curé virus is
not contagious across species.

{16:4}

95 :
When people simply say 'the Curé virus', they're
actually referring to the human version
of the virus.

There are variants, such as the
monkey-specific Curé, the rat-specific Curé...


But from here on out, we'll only be
referring to the human strain.

{16:4}

96 :
Retroviruses turn their host's RNA into DNA
with reverse transcriptase and then inject
that DNA back into the host's genes.

This means they can directly rewrite the
host's blueprint.

Infected cells, which go on processing
proteins as usual, then unwittingly reproduce
the virus.

{16:4}

97 :
At the same time, the cells with the
rewritten DNA go on to divide and multiply,
spreading throughout the body like cancer
cells.

Normally, when cancer cells develop in a
body...

The body repulses them with the 'p53'
function located on the seventeenth chromosome.

{16:4}

98 :
'p53' creates certain enzymes and proteins,
and when there has been damage done to a
gene...

It stops replication or causes apoptosis
(natural cell death) and works to repair the
damaged DNA, thus earning its name 'the
anti-cancer gene'.

The Curé virus mutates this 'p53' gene as
well, rendering it useless.

{16:4}

99 :
Thus, the Curé-infected cells can spread
throughout the body uncontested.


Then, once all the DNA code is rewritten, the
host literally becomes a new species.


A new species‡L{1}
We'll just call it the 'Curé species' here.

{16:4}

100 :
The Curé species body is endowed with the
following unique characteristics:

1. Self-regeneration of the telomeres.

2. Great improvement in self-healing.

{16:4}

101 :
Telomeres are the base sequence located at
either end of a chromosome and generally
become shorter with every replication.

After a certain number of divisions, the
telomere gets so short that the cell can no
longer divide.

So telomeres are like the 'bus tickets' of cell
division. Once you spend them, they're gone.

{16:4}

102 :
But not the Curé species.

This new body produces an enzyme called
telomerase, which allows unlimited recycling
of the 'bus tickets' that normally would
already have been spent.

This allows for almost endless cell division
to continue, thereby eliminating aging and
weakening.

Having said all that, this is not a
particularly unusual phenomenon.

{16:4}

103 :
It happens every day in normal reproductive
cells. Even in most cancer cells, there
is rarely a shortage of telomeres.

In that sense, it is not impossible to say
that the Curé virus turns every cell in the
body cancerous.

{16:4}

104 :
On the other hand, there is no similarly
tangible mechanism yet in place for dealing
with the process of self-healing.

But metabolism is activated, and the rate
of cell generation is greatly increased...

And it is believed that this is what so
dramatically shortens the time required to
heal after an illness or injury.

{16:4}

105 :
Actually, there is one more distinguishing
characteristic of the Curé species.


Which is‡L'infrared vision'.

Because, in its production, it lost the
faculties of 'p53', the Curé species possesses a
constitution extremely vulnerable to
ultraviolet rays.

The DNA in skin cells is quickly damaged when
exposed to the sun for any duration, causing those
cells to become cancerous.

{16:4}

106 :
In a normal human, thanks to the cancer suppression
gene, damaged DNA is let die or repaired...

But the Curé species cannot do this.

It was possible to use another gene to
produce an enzyme to perform the same
function as 'p53', but alas, this solution
proved to be limited.

{16:4}

107 :
Therefore, Curé species are very vulnerable to
ultraviolet rays and can only venture
outside at night.

The 'infrared vision' was developed to make
up for this shortcoming.

{16:4}

108 :

{C5A270}
[Tsugumi]
I have this unique ability.

Having finished her long talk on the Curé virus, Tsugumi brought that up.


{C5A271}
[Tsugumi]
"Without touching something, I can 'see' its 
temperature."


{C5A272}
[Tsugumi]
"Infrared vision... is also called 
infravision..."

[Takeshi]
"So on the second day, when you stood in 
front of the power generation room and knew 
that it was too hot, that was because of your 
infrared vision?"


{C5A273}
[Tsugumi]
Yes.


109 :
[Takeshi]
How about that...

[Takeshi]
Infravision... interesting.


110 :

{C5A274}
[Tsugumi]
You don't doubt me?

She tilted her head like she was surprised.

[Takeshi]
Ah...


{C5A275}
[Tsugumi]
"You believe all this nonsense I've been 
telling you?"

[Takeshi]
Well, it's an unbelievable story.

[Takeshi]
"Viruses, DNA, bodies that won't die... It's 
crazy."

[Takeshi]
I can't believe it... but I don't doubt it.

[Takeshi]
If you say so, it must be true.

[Takeshi]
So, I guess I have to believe it.

The instant I said that...


111 :
My body was being pulled.

Although she wasn't abnormally strong, I found
it impossible to resist her.

It was a natural, flowing movement.

Inside the white gondola.

Tsugumi's body was covering mine.

I felt her breath.

I felt her pulse.

I felt the warmth of her body.

A fragrant smell wafted from her neck.

A musky smell.

A sweet smell...


{C5A276}
[Tsugumi]
You're kidding, right?

She smiled coldly and gazed at me.


{C5A277}
[Tsugumi]
Don't just say 'I believe' so easily.

[Takeshi]
You think it's irresponsible?


{C5A278}
[Tsugumi]
It's very irresponsible.


{C5A279}
[Tsugumi]
How can you believe me? On what basis?

[Takeshi]
None.

[Takeshi]
I have absolutely no basis.


112 :

{C5A280}
[Tsugumi]
You see...

Raising an eyebrow, she put her hand on my
neck.


{C5A281}
[Tsugumi]
Will you cut it out already?

She gave me a look that turned my spine to ice.

But her hands were trembling.

Her coldness was contrived...

[Takeshi]
Calm down, Tsugumi.

I spoke slowly, breathing deliberately.

[Takeshi]
"First of all, do you really need a reason to 
trust people?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"If so, then you don't have to trust me. 
Doubt me all you want."

[Takeshi]
"But I believe you. Even if no one else 
does, I do."

[Takeshi]
I accept the truth.


{C5A282}
[Tsugumi]
But...


{C5A283}
[Tsugumi]
"There's no reason you should be able to do 
that..."

[Takeshi]
But I can.

[Takeshi]
I want to understand you.

[Takeshi]
"Even if it's hard for me to believe, if it's 
the truth."

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"The scar on your right leg, it's almost 
healed, right?"


{C5A284}
[Tsugumi]
Yes...

[Takeshi]
"I can't believe it, but that wound is almost 
healed."

[Takeshi]
That's the reality, right?


{C5A285}
[Tsugumi]
That's right...

[Takeshi]
Show it to me again.

[Takeshi]
I'll accept things as they are.


113 :

{C5A286}
[Tsugumi]
...You want to see it?

She removed her hand.


{C5A287}
[Tsugumi]
You really want to see?

Her voice trembled faintly.

She was speaking slowly, in control.


{C5A288}
[Tsugumi]
If you look, you might regret it.


{C5A289}
[Tsugumi]
If you knew everything...


{C5A290}
[Tsugumi]
"You might think that there's no way I could 
be human..."

[Takeshi]
You don't want me to look?

[Takeshi]
If you show me, maybe you'll regret it?

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"The fact that you're not answering... Was 
that a stupid question?"

[Tsugumi]
.........

[Takeshi]
"If you don't answer, I'm going to look 
whether you want me to or not."


{C5A291}
[Tsugumi]
Don't.


{C5A292}
[Tsugumi]
Don't decide for me.


{C5A293}
[Tsugumi]
I didn't say...


{C5A294}
[Tsugumi]
"I didn't say that I didn't want to show 
you..."


114 :
The room slid into darkness.


115 :

{C5A295}
[Tsugumi]
Then look.


{C5A296}
[Tsugumi]
Don't flinch. Look...


{C5A297}
[Tsugumi]
At everything...


{C5A298}
[Tsugumi]
I'll show you... Only you.

I heard the sound...

Of unfastening.

In the darkness of the gondola.

In the faint moonlight, the deep sea shined
blue.

Floating up into the darkness...

It was...

A wound. Once etched deeply, but since healed
to almost nothing.

I had to squint to see.

I might not have known if I hadn't gently
run my fingers over them.

Scars‡L

All over her body, minutely etched, countless
scars.

Tsugumi's shoulders shook with her weeping.

She cried silently.

I grasped her shoulders.

I pulled her to me, fiercely.

Tears wet the floor.

Tsugumi cried in my arms, on my breast, like
a child.

I wanted Tsugumi, and she wanted me.

She accepted all of me, and I accepted all of
her.

We overlapped until we became one.


116 :
.........

......

...


117 :
My head rested neatly on Tsugumi's legs. She
was sitting on her heels.

I felt the lovely softness of her flesh on
the back of my head.

The gondola had circled the floor many times
and was moving again through the darkness.


118 :
Click, click...

[Takeshi]
What's that?

I looked above to see Tsugumi holding
something in her hand.


119 :
She was clicking what looked like a pen.

[Takeshi]
"I think I heard that same sound in front of 
the generator room..."


{C5A299}
[Tsugumi]
It's an infrared laser.

She smiled quietly and muttered.

[Takeshi]
What?


{C5A300}
[Tsugumi]
It's convenient to have this.


{C5A301}
[Tsugumi]
If you have a special ability like mine...

[Takeshi]
Mm-hmm...

[Takeshi]
"You're basically doing with your eyes the 
same thing an infrared night scope camera 
does, right?"

[Takeshi]
"If you flash an infrared ray, it makes it 
easier to see in the dark."

[Takeshi]
"And since normal people can't see the 
infrared rays, it just looks dark..."

[Takeshi]
"But if you have infrared vision, you can see 
as clearly as you can at high noon..."

Tsugumi nodded.


{C5A302}
[Tsugumi]
That's right...


{C5A303}
[Tsugumi]
I'm fine no matter how dark it is.


{C5A304}
[Tsugumi]
Teehee...

Tsugumi giggled as she covered up her bare
chest.

When she laughed, it jostled me too...

Right about the time that it stopped...


{C5A305}
[Tsugumi]
Hey, Takeshi? Can you get up?

I sat up as ordered.


{C5A306}
[Tsugumi]
I'm going to count down from three...


{C5A307}
[Tsugumi]
Don't close your eyes the whole time, okay?

[Takeshi]
Huh?


{C5A308}
[Tsugumi]
3, 2, 1...


120 :
‡LClick.

There was a sound.

[Takeshi]
Hm? What'd you just do?

I blinked.


{C5A309}
[Tsugumi]
I burned an image.


{C5A310}
[Tsugumi]
I burned an image of you.

[Takeshi]
Burned...?


{C5A311}
[Tsugumi]
Yup. And burned a pretty good one too.


{C5A312}
[Tsugumi]
Here...

She pointed at her chest.


{C5A313}
[Tsugumi]
And...


121 :

{C5A314}
[Tsugumi]
Here too, okay?

[Takeshi]
?

I couldn't see because of the shadow of her
hand.

She was holding something.

Something besides the laser...

In the darkness, I heard the sound of a thin
chain.

[Takeshi]
?

I didn't know what it was.

[Takeshi]
What do you mean by 'here'? Tell me.


{C5A315}
[Tsugumi]
It's a secret~


{C5A316}
[Tsugumi]
Hmm-hmmm~

All she would give me was a mischievous smile.
