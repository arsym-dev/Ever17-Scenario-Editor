1 :

{C2S005}
[Y¤u]
"Anyway, let's go looking for Kuranari and 
Tsugumi."


2 :

{C2S006}
[Sara]
And Sora...?


3 :

{C2S007}
[Y¤u]
Sora is...


{C2S008}
[Y¤u]
...Let's not worry about her for now.


4 :
[Kid]
What?


5 :

{C2S009}
[Y¤u]
"I'll tell you later. Looking for those two
is the top priority right now."


6 :
Y¤u started running.


7 :
Sara and I followed her without knowing what
was going on.


8 :

{C2S010}
[Y¤u]
Mayo. We're in the middle of a blackout now.


9 :

{C2S011}
[Sara]
So what?

[Kid]
Oh, I see...

[Kid]
"Sora's brain is AI, and her body is made by 
RSD."

[Kid]
"Which means... if the power is down, then Sora 
can't appear."


10 :

{C2S012}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


11 :
Saying that, Y¤u started running.

I took Sara by the hand and followed after Y¤u.


12 :
I didn't know where Takeshi and Tsugumi were.

And I couldn't imagine that they would be just
wandering around during a blackout.

So where would they have gone first?


13 :
‡LThe control room.

I couldn't think of anywhere else.

The power was out, so the door didn't open
automatically.

Y¤u pulled the lever next to the door and
opened it manually.


14 :
The three of us went inside...


15 :

{C2S013}
[Y¤u]
"Kuranari! Tsugumi! 
If you're there, then answer!"

Y¤u called into the darkness.


16 :
I wondered why she only called out for Takeshi
and Tsugumi.


17 :
[Kid]
Sora! Sora!

I called to Sora, but there was no answer.

[Kid]
"Sora should've been here. I wonder where 
she went."


18 :
[Kid]
Hello!


{C2S014}
[Sara]
Takeshi! Tsugumi!


19 :
There was no answer.


20 :
Y¤u had picked up a flashlight at some point.

I imagined she had gotten it somewhere in the
control room.

Y¤u turned it on...

A white circle of light appeared on the wall.

Y¤u shined the flashlight left and right,
lighting up all corners of the room.

The electrical system was completely down.

Like an abandoned castle, there was no sign of
warmth left.

There was clearly nobody there.


21 :

{C2S015}
[Sara]
"It doesn't seem... like there's anyone 
here..."


22 :
We left the room.


23 :

{C2S016}
[Y¤u]
Can you carry this?


24 :
Y¤u handed me the flashlight and shut the
control room door.

Just then...


25 :
Splash, splash, splash...

We heard the sounds of someone running toward
us through water.

After a short while, two figures emerged from
the darkness.

[Kid]
Oh, Takeshi!


{C2S017}
[Sara]
Tsugumi!

Takeshi and Tsugumi approached, walking
through the water.


26 :
[Kid]
Hey, have you seen Sora?


27 :

{C2S018}
[Takeshi]
Wasn't she in the control room?


{C2S019}
[Sara]
It was empty...


28 :

{C2S020}
[Takeshi]
Really?


29 :
Takeshi used the manual lever to open the door.

He looked inside...

[Kid]
Do you want a flashlight?


30 :

{C2S021}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, thanks.


31 :
Takeshi took the flashlight, turned it on, and
went into the room.

.....................


32 :

{C2S022}
[Takeshi]
"Geez... Where would Sora go at a time 
like this?"

Takeshi said that when he emerged from the
control room.


33 :

{C2S023}
[Y¤u]
So... what are we going to do?

Y¤u said that calmly, with her hands on her hips.


It had been a series of emergencies
since the day before...

Maybe we were all completely used to it.
In any case, none of us were freaking out.


34 :

{C2S024}
[Sara]
For now...


{C2S025}
[Sara]
All we can do is split up and look for Sora.


35 :

{C2S026}
[Sara]
"Without Sora, we won't know why there's been 
a blackout..."

[Kid]
"Yeah. Sora knows more about LeMU than 
anyone."


36 :

{C2S027}
[Y¤u]
Uh... Sora...


37 :

{C2S028}
[Y¤u]
Sora...


38 :

{C2S029}
[Sara]
?

[Kid]
?


{C2S030}
[Takeshi]
?


39 :

{C2S031}
[Y¤u]
Maybe it's time...


40 :

{C2S032}
[Y¤u]
Since it's come to this, I'll tell you...


{C2S033}
[Y¤u]
I don't think we'll find Sora even if we look.


41 :

{C2S034}
[Sara]
Huh?

[Kid]
What?


{C2S035}
[Takeshi]
Why not?


42 :

{C2S036}
[Y¤u]
I can't tell you the reason.


{C2S037}
[Y¤u]
"That's something that you should hear from 
Sora herself..."


43 :

{C2S038}
[Sara]
?

[Kid]
?


44 :

{C2S039}
[Takeshi]
?


45 :

{C2S040}
[Y¤u]
Anyway, just take my word for it.


{C2S041}
[Y¤u]
You don't have to worry. Sora is just fine.


{C2S042}
[Y¤u]
And she'll come back for sure.

[Kid]
Come back?

Y¤u ignored my question.


46 :

{C2S043}
[Tsugumi]
I see...


{C2S044}
[Tsugumi]
So what are you going to do?


47 :

{C2S045}
[Takeshi]
Hey, are you alright? Everybody's okay?


48 :

{C2S046}
[Tsugumi]
It's only a blackout. You worry too much...


49 :

{C2S047}
[Takeshi]
But... Sora's missing!

[Kid]
It's a blackout, so Sora is...


{C2S048}
[Takeshi]
Yeah, I know that...


{C2S049}
[Takeshi]
I know that, but... let's see...


50 :

{C2S050}
[Takeshi]
"If this blackout goes on, don't you think 
that Sora might never appear again?"


51 :

{C2S051}
[Y¤u]
"That's something you don't have to worry 
about."


{C2S052}
[Y¤u]
I've got an idea.


52 :

{C2S053}
[Tsugumi]
...An idea?


53 :

{C2S054}
[Y¤u]
I think we should try the generator room...


54 :

{C2S055}
[Sara]
The generator room?


{C2S056}
[Y¤u]
"I figure that the cause of this blackout is 
trouble in the generator room."

That reminded me of something Sora had said
the day before...

LeMU didn't receive any power from the
outside, but had an in-house generator
system.

There was a thermal seafloor vent where hot
water was pumped out of the seabed, and heat
from that was used to operate the generator.


55 :

{C2S057}
[Y¤u]
Tsugumi, you'll come along, won't you?


56 :

{C2S058}
[Tsugumi]
Sorry, but I'm not up for it.


57 :

{C2S059}
[Y¤u]
What?


58 :

{C2S060}
[Tsugumi]
I'm not going.


{C2S061}
[Tsugumi]
If you want to go, be my guest.


59 :
Saying that, Tsugumi left.

It didn't look like it would be any use
calling after her.


60 :

{C2S062}
[Takeshi]
"Geez. I have no clue what's going on in that 
girl's head."


61 :

{C2S063}
[Y¤u]
Oh well. The four of us will have to go.


62 :

{C2S064}
[Sara]
Nakkyu, where is the generator room?


{C2S065}
[Y¤u]
The generator room is here‡Lin Dritter Stock.


63 :

{C2S066}
[Takeshi]
Okay! Let's hop to it, everybody!


64 :
Takeshi started walking toward the corridor.


65 :

{C2S067}
[Y¤u]
"Hey, Kuranari, where do you think 
you're going?"


66 :

{C2S068}
[Takeshi]
"Where? To the generator room, of course. 
It was your idea to start with, right?"


{C2S069}
[Y¤u]
And just how do you intend to get there?


67 :

{C2S070}
[Takeshi]
Huh? By walking through the corridors, dummy.


68 :

{C2S071}
[Y¤u]
"Oh, please... You really don't get 
anything, do you?"


69 :

{C2S072}
[Takeshi]
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

[Kid]
Hey, Y¤u. I don't think I get it either...


{C2S073}
[Sara]
Me neither.


70 :

{C2S074}
[Y¤u]
"You guys don't remember the map of LeMU we 
saw yesterday?"


71 :

{C2S075}
[Takeshi]
Map? Map... Map...


72 :

{C2S076}
[Sara]
"Oh... You mean the three-story map that was 
split into two areas?"

[Kid]
Oh, that's right...


{C2S077}
[Y¤u]
You remember it too, Kuranari?


73 :

{C2S078}
[Takeshi]
"I can't say I remember it exactly... but 
kinda, yeah."


74 :

{C2S079}
[Y¤u]
And what was between those two areas?


{C2S080}
[Takeshi]
Between them? How am I supposed to know...?

[Kid]
Hmmm... I don't think there was anything.


75 :

{C2S081}
[Y¤u]
Bingo.


{C2S082}
[Y¤u]
Meaning what?

[Kid]
"The two areas are divided by a block 
which is now underwater...?"


{C2S083}
[Y¤u]
So?


{C2S084}
[Sara]
"We can't move directly from the control room
area to the generator room area."

[Kid]
"Besides that, the emergency stairs of one of 
those areas was also flooded..."


76 :

{C2S085}
[Y¤u]
So what?


{C2S086}
[Takeshi]
Oh, I see...


{C2S087}
[Takeshi]
"To get to the generator room's area, we have 
to access the second floor..."


77 :

{C2S088}
[Takeshi]
"And the only way we can do that is by using 
the neutral buoyancy elevator."


78 :

{C2S089}
[Y¤u]
Correct.


{C2S090}
[Y¤u]
So we have to go to...

[Kid]
"To the entrance to the neutral buoyancy 
elevator."


79 :

{C2S091}
[Y¤u]
That's right.


80 :

{C2S092}
[Y¤u]
Now that you've got it... let's get going!


{C2S093}
[Sara]
Ready, set, go! Nin! Nin! Ninja!


81 :
Sara took a bizarre kung fu pose and started
spinning like a top.

I had no clue what she was trying to do.
