1 :
He was in the middle of a blue world.


2 :
As far as the eye could see, a sheet of water{1}reached into the distance.

The May sun shimmered on its surface.

Above, high above, stretched a clear blue sky.


The fresh new sky looked so glossy and vivid{1}that it might spill down to Earth at any{1}moment.

That was all that was reflected in his eyes.

The straight line of the horizon stretched into{1}the distance, dividing the sea from the{1}heavens.


3 :

{EOP000}
[Takeshi]{1}"So tranquil..."

He murmured to himself.

A solitary seagull traced a gentle arc in the{1}sky as the wind carried it away.

The wind, carrying the ocean's scent, blew by{1}him gently.

The din of people could be heard in the{1}background.

The merry sound of children's voices echoed{1}brighter than the sunlight pouring down.


{EOP001}
[Takeshi]{1}"So peaceful..."

It was as if it was in a dream.


4 :
‡L16 km from M Island, Komagahara Archipelago,{1}Tokyo.

The man-made island, Insel Null, rose above the{1}waves of the water. It seemed like a place{1}removed from reality.

The word 'utopia' might have sprung to mind to{1}describe it.

Actually, on a slab of rock on the boat dock of{1}the floating island were carved the words:



5 :
'Where is heaven?'

'Above the sky, and at your feet...'


6 :
Leaning out over the railing of the island, he{1}gazed into the ocean depths.

In the blue distance, he saw a massive metallic{1}structure swaying gently.


{EOP002}
[Takeshi]{1}"Utopia, huh...?"

He mumbled and looked back casually...


7 :
And there was a tanuki, or raccoon dog.

His eyes met those of the animal's.

For a moment, they eyed each other in silence.


{EOP003}
[Takeshi]{1}"Uh... He-hello..."

To clear the air, he nodded his head.


The animal turned away, ignoring him.


8 :
Upon closer inspection, he noticed something{1}biting the animal from behind.


9 :

{EOP004}
[???]{1}"Grr... Grr... Grr..."

It was a young girl.

She was shaped like a 'person'.


Looking closer revealed that there was something{1}strange about her as well.


10 :

{PIPI_24}
[???]{1}"Grr... Grr... Grr..."

Namely, a small tanuki attached to the girl's{1}backside.

'In front of him, there was a big tanuki being{1}bitten by a girl who was being bitten by a{1}smaller tanuki.'

The scene was enough to make him lose his sense{1}of reality.

He rubbed his eyes, rubbed them some more, and{1}opened them again...

Even after blinking several times... the bizarre{1}scene refused to go away.


{EOP005}
[Tanuki]{1}"Hey."


{EOP006}
[Tanuki]{1}"Would you do something about this kid?"

Whispered the big tanuki.

But the words didn't reach his mind because it{1}was so busy trying to process the absurd{1}scene.


{PIPI_24}
[???]{1}"Grr... Grr... Grr..."


{EOP007}
[???]{1}"Grr... Grr... Grr..."

(I must be dreaming, right?)

‡LThat was what he was really thinking.


11 :
A dream‡L

A dream that would not let him wake up.

And whiteness.

A cold, white reality stretching forever.

He felt the difference in temperature on his{1}skin...

The shock of it finally forced him to open his{1}eyes.


12 :
[Kid]{1}"..."

He wondered how long he had been sitting.

It couldn't have been long.

He had only been in the park an hour.

He'd been sitting on the bench the whole time.

Eating the same ice cream.


{EOP008}
[Kid]{1}"It's cold."

Of course it was.

It had melted into a muddy mess.

The melted vanilla ice cream trickled onto his{1}hand, spilling on his lap.


{EOP009}
[Kid]{1}"Wooh, that's cold."

The ice cream slowly soaked into the fabric of{1}his pants.

Finally, the coldness of it had spread{1}completely, soaking into his skin.

He had been sitting there a while.

He had been sitting so long.

But the person he was waiting for never came.

There was no sign that she would.

(Why hasn't she come?)

He didn't know.

(Why am I here?)

He felt like he was teetering on the verge of{1}utter confusion.


{EOP010}
[Kid]{1}"Oh well..."

He shook his head and sighed.

It didn't seem his pants would dry any time{1}soon.


13 :

{EOP011}
[Park staff]{1}"What's wrong?"

He sensed a slight movement, and a girl sat down{1}next to him.


14 :
She was sporting the theme park uniform.

A white outfit with a bluish ribbon.

She looked like a guide.


{EOP012}
[Park staff]{1}"Are you lost?"

A beaming, innocent smile appeared on her{1}shining face.


{EOP013}
[Park staff]{1}"Did you get separated from your friends?"


{EOP014}
[Kid]{1}"Yeah."


{EOP015}
[Kid]{1}"I've been waiting."


15 :

{EOP016}
[Park staff]{1}"Waiting?"


{EOP017}
[Kid]{1}"Well..."


{EOP018}
[Kid]{1}"I was waiting."


{EOP019}
[Park staff]{1}"You were waiting..."


16 :

{EOP020}
[Park staff]{1}"For me?"


{EOP021}
[Kid]{1}"N-no..."

Looking at her grin, he seemed to be{1}flustered.



{EOP022}
[Kid]{1}"I was told to wait here, so..."


17 :

{EOP023}
[Park staff]{1}"I see..."


{EOP024}
[Park staff]{1}"But it looks like they're not coming."

She gave him a sideways glance.


{EOP025}
[Park staff]{1}"Listen, you've obviously been stood up, and{1}you're tired of waiting..."

18 :

{EOP026}
[Park staff]{1}"I know!"

Her face suddenly lit up, and she clapped her{1}hands together.


{EOP027}
[Park staff]{1}"Hey, hey, you're alone, right?"


{EOP028}
[Kid]{1}"Huh?"


{EOP029}
[Park staff]{1}"Well, you're bored, right? How about I give you{1}a tour of LeMU?"

She tugged at his arm.

Without waiting for his reply, she made him{1}stand.


{EOP030}
[Kid]{1}"B-but I'm waiting for someone."


19 :

{EOP031}
[Park staff]{1}"Waiting? For who?"


{EOP032}
[Kid]{1}"...Uh..."

Who was it?

He couldn't think of the name.


{EOP033}
[Park staff]{1}"Well, I dunno who you're waiting for, but..."


20 :

{EOP034}
[Park staff]{1}"If they haven't shown up yet, don't you think{1}you've waited long enough?"

She said that happily, almost prancing around.


{EOP035}
[Park staff]{1}"Whaddya say? How about it?"


{EOP036}
[Kid]{1}"Al-alright..."

He nodded slightly.

The girl's nametag glittered brightly against{1}the white fabric of her uniform.


{EOP037}
[Kid]{1}"<Y-O-U>...?"

That was what it said.


21 :

{EOP038}
[Y¤u]{1}"<I am You!>"


{EOP039}
[Kid]{1}"?"

I am you...?


{EOP040}
[Y¤u]{1}"Yup."

She nodded.


{EOP041}
[Y¤u]{1}"My last name is Tanaka..."


{EOP042}
[Y¤u]{1}"And my first name is Y¤u..."


{EOP043}
[Kid]{1}"Y¤u...?"


{EOP044}
[Y¤u]{1}"My real name is much longer, though."


{EOP045}
[Kid]{1}"Longer?"


{EOP046}
[Y¤u]{1}"Long, like, endlessly long. But..."


{EOP047}
[Y¤u]{1}"But it's such a pain... Just call me 'Y¤u'."


22 :

{EOP048}
[Y¤u]{1}"Nice to meet you!"

With that, she enthusiastically stuck out her{1}hand.

{EOP049}
[Kid]{1}"N-nice to meet you?"

Without thinking, he shook her hand.

And before he realized it, he'd been sucked{1}along into her rhythm.


23 :

{EOP050}
[Y¤u]{1}"So shall we go?"

They reluctantly released hands.

He looked once again at his hand, which had{1}connected them moments before.

The vanilla ice cream that had spilled on it had{1}completely melted away.


24 :
(Huh?)

He noticed that the two tanuki had formed a line{1}and were moving forward.

In front of them was a massive gate that had{1}been sealed shut.

The gate swung open soundlessly, and the big{1}tanuki, the little tanuki, and the girl went{1}inside.


25 :
(Finally! My turn...)

He followed their footsteps.


26 :
That was LeMU's only entrance for visitors.


27 :
Several park employees waited at the gate and{1}handed over what looked like earphones to the{1}visitors.

It seemed that the earphones were to be used at{1}some point up ahead.

He wondered why.


28 :
Looking around skeptically, but obeying{1}instructions, he stepped into the building.


29 :
He surveyed the ceiling.

There were no windows. From the polished round{1}walls, it was clear that the room was{1}dome-shaped.

He looked around.

Many of the visitors who had been waiting in{1}line headed into the room.

Among them were friends, amorous couples, and{1}people with their families.

However, it seemed the 'Tanuki family' had split{1}up.

The big tanuki shoved its way through the crowd{1}of people and continued through a door on the{1}other side of the room.

The young girl stayed on the same side of the{1}room as the little tanuki.

(I've got no clue what those tanuki are all{1}about, but...)

(I guess my friends aren't here either...)

He didn't see any familiar faces around.

He figured maybe they had already taken the far{1}elevator downstairs.

Just 20 minutes earlier, the visitor room had{1}reached capacity...

And the friends he had been waiting with had{1}gone ahead, leaving him behind to go down with{1}the next group.

(Oh well. I'm sure I'll find everyone down below{1}soon enough.)

Finally, the gate to the entrance slipped shut{1}quietly.

The big tanuki fiddled with something on the{1}wall, and the room got a shade darker.


30 :

{EOP051}
[Park staff]{1}"Hello, everybody!"

A park employee emerged out of the darkness.

He wondered where she had come from. She was{1}wearing a flashy dress.

The dim light shining on her made her seem like{1}a character from some dream.


31 :
[Visitors]{1}"..."


{EOP052}
[Park staff]{1}"What? No reaction, folks?"


{EOP053}
[Park staff]{1}"I'll try that again..."


{EOP054}
[Park staff]{1}"Hello!"


{EOP055}
[Young Girl]{1}"Hellooooo!"

It was the girl who, just a little while ago,{1}had been attached to the rear of the large{1}tanuki.


32 :

{EOP056}
[Park staff]{1}"Oh! I've found a girl with some spunk."


{EOP057}
[Park staff]{1}"What's your name?"


{EOP058}
[Young Girl]{1}"I'm Ya-ga-mi £o-¢o!"


{EOP059}
[£o¢o]{1}"This is my pet dog, Pipi."


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]{1}"*Woof*!"

(So that isn't a tanuki, it's a dog.)

(I thought they didn't let pets in here...)

He tilted his head doubtfully.


{EOP060}
[Park staff]{1}"So, £o¢o-chan, how many times have you been to{1}LeMU?"


33 :

{EOP061}
[£o¢o]{1}"Uh, well... One, two, three, four, five..."


{EOP062}
[£o¢o]{1}"This is my first time!"


{EOP063}
[Park staff]{1}"Heehee. Aren't you a funny girl?"


{EOP064}
[£o¢o]{1}"I get that a lot."


{EOP065}
[£o¢o]{1}"You want me to do something even more funny?"

34 :

{EOP066}
[Park staff]{1}"What?"


{EOP067}
[£o¢o]{1}"My friend told me a good joke the other day!"

35 :

{EOP068}
[Park staff]{1}"O-ooh... Er... Maybe some other time."


{EOP069}
[£o¢o]{1}"Why not?"


{EOP070}
[Park staff]{1}"Because I have to tell everyone something right{1}now."


{EOP071}
[£o¢o]{1}"Oh. Okay then..."


{EOP072}
[£o¢o]{1}"But it's really funny..."


{EOP073}
[£o¢o]{1}"That's too bad, huh, Pipi?"


{PIPI_01}
[Pipi]{1}"*Woof*!"


36 :

{EOP074}
[Park staff]{1}"Ahem. Once again..."


37 :

{EOP075}
[Park staff]{1}"On behalf of the LeMU marine theme park, I'd{1}like to thank you very much for coming."


{EOP076}
[Park staff]{1}"I am about to give you a brief explanation{1}about the LeMU theme park and tell you a few{1}things to watch out for."


{EOP077}
[£o¢o]{1}"Hey, who cares? Hurry up and let us inside{1}already!"


{EOP078}
[Park staff]{1}"I would love to take everyone inside..."


{EOP079}
[Park staff]{1}"But I'm terribly sorry."


{EOP080}
[Park staff]{1}"Everyone will actually have to stay in this{1}room for now."


{EOP081}
[Park staff]{1}"It will only take seventeen minutes."


{EOP082}
[Park staff]{1}"So please just bear with me for that long."


38 :

{EOP083}
[Park staff]{1}"First, let me explain a bit about this room...{1}It is called a compression chamber."


{EOP084}
[Park staff]{1}"Starting from now, the air pressure in here is{1}going to rise to six atmospheres."


{EOP085}
[Park staff]{1}"Why do you think it is necessary to raise the{1}air pressure? I'll explain the reason for it in{1}a moment..."


39 :

{EOP086}
[Park staff]{1}"But before that, let me tell you a few things{1}you should be aware of."


{EOP087}
[Park staff]{1}"As the air pressure rises, you may start to{1}feel a strange sensation in your ears."


{EOP088}
[Park staff]{1}"Like when you are descending a mountain or in{1}an airplane. It's because the increased air{1}pressure is pressing on your ear drums."


40 :

{EOP089}
[Park staff]{1}"So if you think your ears feel a bit{1}strange..."


{EOP090}
[Park staff]{1}"Pinch your nose with your fingers, close your{1}mouth tight, and try to pop your ears."


{EOP091}
[Park staff]{1}"If that doesn't get your ears back to normal,{1}or you if don't feel well, please raise your{1}hand and let me know."


{EOP092}
[Park staff]{1}"In the event that happens, we will immediately{1}stop increasing the air pressure."


41 :

{EOP093}
[Park staff]{1}"By the way, are there any people here who don't{1}know how to pop their ears?"

[Park staff]{1}"..."


{EOP094}
[Park Staff]{1}"Is everything clear then?"

[Park staff]{1}"..."


42 :

{EOP095}
[Park staff]{1}"Alright then. We'll initiate the rise in{1}pressure."


{EOP096}
[Park staff]{1}"As I said before, the time required to increase{1}the pressure is seventeen minutes."


{EOP097}
[Park staff]{1}"During that time, I will explain to everyone{1}about the structure of LeMU."


43 :

{EOP098}
[Park staff]{1}"As you all know, LeMU is floating in the{1}ocean..."


{EOP099}
[Park staff]{1}"At a depth of between 17 and 51 meters..."


44 :

{EOP100}
[Park staff]{1}"Now, if you look at this chart, you will see{1}that the structure is divided into four{1}layers."


{EOP101}
[Park staff]{1}"From the top, these are called Insel Null,{1}Erster Boden, Zweiter Stock, and Dritter{1}Stock..."


{EOP102}
[Park staff]{1}"In terms of a normal building, you might think{1}of it as a structure with a ground floor{1}extending down to a three-story basement."


{EOP103}
[Park staff]{1}"Insel Null, here, is a floating island."


{EOP104}
[Park staff]{1}"It is an immense man-made island floating in{1}the ocean..."


{EOP105}
[Park staff]{1}"In German, 'insel' means 'island' and 'null'{1}means 'zero'."


{EOP106}
[Park staff]{1}"In other words, this is floor zero, or the{1}ground floor."


{EOP107}
[Park staff]{1}"Next is from Erster to Dritter..."

Just then.


{EOP108}
[£o¢o]{1}"Hey, hey. Hey, you."


{EOP109}
[£o¢o]{1}"Hey, I'm talking to you."

As he was listening to the explanation, someone{1}pulled on him from behind.

He turned to look around.


45 :
It was the girl who had just been talking with{1}the park staff.

(What was her name again...?)


{EOP110}
[£o¢o]{1}"Hey. Don't you want to know about my joke?"

(Oh, that's right.)

(Her name was £o¢o.)

(And that animal she's holding is Pepe, or Popo,{1}or something...)


{EOP111}
[£o¢o]{1}"You wanna know, don't you?"


{EOP112}
[Takeshi]{1}"Huh? What?"


{EOP113}
[£o¢o]{1}"The joke I was just talking about. It's an{1}Ame-joke."


{EOP114}
[Takeshi]{1}"An ame... joke?"


46 :

{EOP115}
[£o¢o]{1}"You haven't heard about them? They're real{1}popular now, ya know."


{EOP116}
[Takeshi]{1}"No, I haven't. What are you talking about?"


47 :

{EOP117}
[£o¢o]{1}"An Ame-joke is an American joke. Get it?{1}'Ame-joke'."


{EOP118}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hm? Hmm..."


{EOP119}
[£o¢o]{1}"Makes you wanna hear it, right? Want me to tell{1}you?"


48 :
{11:0-00}
{11:1}Listen to the joke

{11:1}Listen to the staff member's explanation


49 :

{EOP120}
[Takeshi]{1}"Yeah, I guess I'll listen to it."


50 :

{EOP121}
[£o¢o]{1}"Okay! Here it goes!"


51 :

{EOP122}
[£o¢o]{1}"Once, there was this guy who was talking to the{1}ghost of his dead grandfather. So he asked him a{1}question."


{EOP123}
[£o¢o]{1}"'How long is a million years to a ghost?', he{1}asked."


{EOP124}
[£o¢o]{1}"And the ghost answered."


{EOP125}
[£o¢o]{1}"'A million years is like a second to me.'"


{EOP126}
[£o¢o]{1}"Next, the man asked..."


{EOP127}
[£o¢o]{1}"'How much is a million dollars to a ghost?'"


{EOP128}
[£o¢o]{1}"And the ghost answered."


{EOP129}
[£o¢o]{1}"'A million dollars? It is but one small cent to{1}me.'"


{EOP130}
[£o¢o]{1}"When he heard that, the man pretended to smile{1}all nice and then said..."


{EOP131}
[£o¢o]{1}"'Well then, gramps, how about giving me one of{1}your cents?'"


{EOP132}
[£o¢o]{1}"Laughing, the ghost replied."


{EOP133}
[£o¢o]{1}"'Sure. Right away.'"


{EOP134}
[£o¢o]{1}"'But can I get you to wait just a second?'"

[Takeshi]{1}"..."


{EOP135}
[£o¢o]{1}"Heeheeheee..."


52 :

{EOP136}
[£o¢o]{1}"Waaahahaha!"


{EOP137}
[£o¢o]{1}"Well? That's a pretty good joke, huh?"


53 :

{EOP138}
[Takeshi]{1}"Well, I suppose it could be worse, but... I'll{1}talk to you later."


{EOP139}
[£o¢o]{1}"Huh."

Patting the little dog's head, he turned back to{1}listen to the explanation.


54 :

{EOP140}
[Park staff]{1}"So now you should now have a general{1}understanding of the layout of each floor."


{EOP141}
[Park staff]{1}"By the way, LeMU was designed with saturation{1}diving specifications."


{EOP142}
[Park staff]{1}"In other words, the air pressure inside is{1}equivalent to or greater than the water pressure{1}outside."


{EOP143}
[Park staff]{1}"As I said at the beginning..."


{EOP144}
[Park staff]{1}"The complex that we're all going to enter is{1}filled with a mixture of gases at six{1}atmospheres."


{EOP145}
[Park staff]{1}"So right now our bodies are adjusting to be{1}able to handle pressure equivalent to six{1}atmospheres."


{EOP146}
[Park staff]{1}"Of course, this mixture of gases is composed of{1}oxygen, nitrogen, and helium, and is completely{1}harmless to people."


{EOP147}
[Park staff]{1}"The reason for raising the air pressure inside{1}is..."


{EOP148}
[Park staff]{1}"That it is essential to make LeMU safe for{1}everyone."


{EOP149}
[Park staff]{1}"Okay, everyone, we are now going to enter the{1}ocean..."


{EOP150}
[Park staff]{1}"Are any of you here feeling just a little bit{1}nervous?"


{EOP151}
[Park staff]{1}"You might be worrying about what would happen{1}if seawater started leaking inside, or that you{1}might be crushed by the water pressure, or us{1}sinking."


{EOP152}
[Park staff]{1}"However, please relax. There is nothing to{1}worry about."


{EOP153}
[Park staff]{1}"There is absolutely no way that LeMU could be{1}crushed by the outside water pressure because we{1}have raised the air pressure inside."


55 :

{EOP154}
[Park staff]{1}"By the way, before we entered this{1}pressurization chamber, we handed out earphones{1}to everyone, remember?"


{EOP155}
[Park staff]{1}"Yes, that's right, the earphones that everyone{1}is using right now."


56 :

{EOP156}
[Park staff]{1}"These are not your average earphones. They are{1}'voice alternators'."


{EOP157}
[Park staff]{1}"LeMU is pumped full of helium gas, so without{1}these in your ears, you'll sound like a duck."

He removed his voice alternators to see what{1}would happen.


57 :
(Haha! It's true! People really do sound like{1}ducks.)

(Then again, maybe they sound more like aliens{1}than ducks.)

The voices of the people around him jumped to a{1}strange higher tone.


58 :

{EOP158}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey, say something."


{EOP159}
[£o¢o]{1}"Like what?"


{EOP160}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hahaha! Your voice is hilarious."


{EOP161}
[£o¢o]{1}"Huh? My voice?"


59 :
£o¢o hadn't been listening to the explanation.


{EOP162}
[Takeshi]{1}"Can you tell me that joke one more time?"


{EOP163}
[£o¢o]{1}"Why?"


{EOP164}
[Takeshi]{1}"C'mon, just do it."


{EOP165}
[£o¢o]{1}"Once, there was this guy who was talking to the{1}ghost of his dead grandfather. So he asked him a{1}question."


{EOP166}
[£o¢o]{1}"'How long is a million years to a ghost?', he{1}asked."


{EOP167}
[£o¢o]{1}"And the ghost answered."


{EOP168}
[Takeshi]{1}"Heee... heee..."


{EOP169}
[Takeshi]{1}"Waaahaaaah!"


60 :

{EOP170}
[£o¢o]{1}"What? That's weird. You didn't even laugh at{1}all just a second ago."

He put the voice alternators back in his ears{1}and looked back at the staff member again.


61 :

{EOP171}
[£o¢o]{1}"What's wrong with my voice?"


{EOP172}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hahaha. You weren't listening to the{1}explanation."


{EOP173}
[£o¢o]{1}"What are you laughing at? Why are you smiling{1}like that?"


{EOP174}
[£o¢o]{1}"You're acting really weird."


{EOP175}
[Takeshi]{1}"Well, why don't you try listening to your own{1}voice?"


{EOP176}
[£o¢o]{1}"Huh?"


{EOP177}
[Takeshi]{1}"It's so funny. You sound like an eight-legged{1}alien."


62 :

{EOP178}
[£o¢o]{1}"Alien? Alien as in 'Take us to your leader'...{1}goooba joooba doooba space alien?"


{EOP179}
[£o¢o]{1}"Like a Martian or someone from Planet Kuikui,{1}or something?"


{EOP180}
[£o¢o]{1}"A star person? From the far edge of the galaxy,{1}with lasers...?"

[Takeshi]{1}"..."


63 :

{EOP181}
[£o¢o]{1}"My joke was a lot funnier than THAT!"


{EOP182}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hee... haha..."


{EOP183}
[Takeshi]{1}"Waaahaaaah!"


{EOP184}
[Takeshi]{1}"That's enough. I can't take any more of this.{1}Thanks."

He put the voice alternators back in his ears{1}and looked back at the staff member again.



64 :

{EOP185}
[Park staff]{1}"And that pretty much covers it."


{EOP186}
[Park staff]{1}"In approximately one minute, the door on this{1}side of the room will open."


{EOP187}
[Park staff]{1}"On the other side of that door is an elevator,{1}and at the bottom of it, a brilliant paradise{1}awaits."


{EOP188}
[Park staff]{1}"We hope that you enjoy yourself to your heart's{1}content here at the marine theme park LeMU."


65 :

{EOP189}
[Takeshi]{1}"Well, shall we go...?"

Just as he headed for the elevator...


{EOP190}
[£o¢o]{1}"So are you here by yourself?"


{EOP191}
[Takeshi]{1}"Who, me? No, I got separated from my{1}friends."


{EOP192}
[£o¢o]{1}"So you're lost?"


{EOP193}
[Takeshi]{1}"Not exactly. But something like that."


{EOP194}
[Takeshi]{1}"I'll head down the elevator and take a look{1}around."


66 :

{EOP195}
[£o¢o]{1}"How about checking with that girl who was just{1}talking?"


{EOP196}
[Takeshi]{1}"Oh, I suppose I could do that. Excuse me..."


67 :
Looking back, he saw that the employee had{1}already disappeared.


68 :

{EOP197}
[Y¤u]{1}"Hmmmm. So you came to LeMU by yourself?"


{EOP198}
[Kid]{1}"Yup. That's right."


69 :

{EOP199}
[Y¤u]{1}"Even so..."

After bending down to wipe away the white stain{1}on his pants, Y¤u stood up.


{EOP200}
[Y¤u]{1}"You don't see that very often, a guy coming to{1}a park like this alone."

That was true.

It was paradise‡Lan amusement park.

In that instant, he had almost forgotten even{1}that.


70 :

{EOP201}
[Y¤u]{1}"So why didn't you go into the park with your{1}friends?"


{EOP202}
[Y¤u]{1}"Why arrange to meet inside LeMU?"


{EOP203}
[Kid]{1}"Huh? Th-that's because..."

Now that she mentioned it...

Who HAD said to wait on that bench...?


Whose idea was it anyway?


71 :

{EOP204}
[Y¤u]{1}"Oh well. Whatever, I won't push you."

[Kid]{1}"........."

Who was it...?


{EOP205}
[Y¤u]{1}"But I suppose that... Well, I mean..."


72 :

{EOP206}
[Y¤u]{1}"You've kind of been stood up... Right?"


{EOP207}
[Kid]{1}"What?"


{EOP208}
[Kid]{1}"Stood... up?"

Stood up...

It took a moment for the meaning of the phrase{1}to register.

[Kid]{1}"............"


73 :

{EOP209}
[Y¤u]{1}"Wow! I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?{1}Uh... Sorry..."


74 :
She shrugged slightly, embarrassed.


75 :

{EOP210}
[Y¤u]{1}"Well, well. Don't get depressed about it!"

She changed modes abruptly and let out a hearty{1}laugh.

She slapped him solidly on the back.


{EOP211}
[Y¤u]{1}"I'll look out for you. Alright?"


{EOP212}
[Kid]{1}"Al-alright."

He nodded, a bit overwhelmed.

(So...)

(I was stood up...)

(I must have been dumped...)

(Huh...?)

Then again, he wasn't sure exactly what had{1}happened.


76 :

{EOP213}
[Kid]{1}"But..."


77 :

{EOP214}
[Y¤u]{1}"Huh? What?"


{EOP215}
[Kid]{1}"Aren't you working right now, Y¤u?"


78 :

{EOP216}
[Y¤u]{1}"You'd make a scary boss."

No matter how many times he checked, she was{1}definitely still wearing a LeMU uniform.


{EOP217}
[Y¤u]{1}"I didn't have anything to do anyway. It's{1}perfect timing. Yeah."

They got in an egg-like elevator together.


79 :
The egg slowly began to move.

It felt like they were slowly floating up.


80 :

{EOP218}
[Y¤u]{1}"Going up..."

She whispered mischievously.

[Kid]{1}"............"

The elevator was terribly crowded.

And everyone was packed in like sardines.


{EOP219}
[Y¤u]{1}"Whoa... It's a little hot, huh?"


{EOP220}
[Kid]{1}"I'll say..."

Her face was so close that he almost bumped into{1}it.


Their bodies were flush against each other. She{1}was soft and warm.

He was surprised.

All of a sudden, he felt embarrassed and started{1}to squirm.


81 :

{EOP221}
[Y¤u]{1}"Hey, kid."


{EOP222}
[Y¤u]{1}"Don't go touching places you shouldn't..."

She whispered into his ear, puffing out her{1}cheeks.

Crammed in the elevator, he couldn't move at{1}all.



82 :

{EOP223}
[Y¤u]{1}"That tickles... Don't move so much."


{EOP224}
[Kid]{1}"I don't have a lot of choice."


{EOP225}
[Kid]{1}"I can't... breathe."

He couldn't move, but he couldn't bear standing{1}still either.

As he gasped for breath, he noticed her light{1}perfume.


83 :
Finally, the egg arrived at the top floor, and{1}his suffering was over.


84 :

{EOP226}
[Kid]{1}"Whew!"

He let out a cry and bolted from the elevator.


85 :

{EOP227}
[Y¤u]{1}"What... What's with you all of a sudden?"


86 :

{EOP228}
[Y¤u]{1}"Hey! Wait! Kid! Kid!"

He sprinted away, leaving Y¤u far behind.


87 :
It wasn't that he was trying to escape from{1}her.


He'd seen something.

At the edge of his vision, he thought he'd seen{1}someone.

Up ahead... that someone was still visible.

He chased after whoever it was like a man{1}possessed.

(I've seen that face before...)

(I'm sure I've seen that face before.)

That was what his instincts were telling him.

But where had he seen them?

He tried to sort through his foggy memory.

As he sifted, he kept running forward.


{EOP229}
[Kid]{1}"Wait...!"

He felt a desperate need to meet the person.

But he had to hurry.


88 :

{EOP230}
[Kid]{1}"*Huff*... *puff*..."

Eventually, he ran out of breath.

Holding his pounding chest, he looked up.


{EOP231}
[Kid]{1}"Ah!"


89 :
(There she was!)

Mixed amongst the other people was a girl,{1}standing.

He was sure that the person that he had been{1}searching for was that girl.

It was the middle of the holidays, but for some{1}reason she was wearing her school uniform...

He wondered why she was alone there.

(Oh yeah... I've got to talk to her...)

She was by herself.

She was all alone. Just like him.

(What should I say...?)

(Where should I start... Let's see...)

He needed to calm down and focus.

(Huh...?)

(Why is it I have to talk to her...?)

(Why in the world?)

Who was she?

Who was... she...?

She was...

Well, she was...


90 :

{EOP232}
[Kid]{1}"Aaagh!"

91 :


92 :
He was caught up in a wave of people.

[Kid]{1}"..."

He got pushed into an elevator. It started to{1}rise toward the surface.


93 :
Seventeen meters below sea level, the elevator{1}stopped at the first basement floor.

He got off the elevator as if he were being spit{1}out.

This floor is called Erster Boden...

He glanced around at his surroundings.

She wasn't anywhere to be seen.

He thought that they had both ridden on the{1}elevator together...

But he had apparently lost sight of her in the{1}crowd when he got off.

He lost her...

He hadn't even been able to say a word.

He felt really depressed.

(Maybe...)

(Did she call out to me?)

That idea suddenly popped into his head.


94 :

{EOP233}
[Kid]{1}"What is this... This feeling...?"

His heart was still beating furiously.


95 :

{EOP234}
[Park staff]{1}"Is something the matter?"

A uniformed staff member, different than Y¤u,{1}was talking to him.


{EOP235}
[Park staff]{1}"Are you looking for someone?"

She gave him a warm smile as she said that.


{EOP236}
[Kid]{1}"Eh! Uh, uh... Yes, I am."

Feeling that he seemed a little desperate, he{1}quickly blurted out an answer.


{EOP237}
[Kid]{1}"I'm trying to find someone!"


{EOP238}
[Kid]{1}"I was supposed to meet up with them, but we{1}must have missed each other."


{EOP239}
[Park staff]{1}"Who is it? What is their name?"


{EOP240}
[Kid]{1}"Uh, their name..."


{EOP241}
[???]{1}"Hey! You there! Wait!"


96 :
Patter, patter, patter.

Suddenly, the sounds of footsteps came rushing{1}at him.


{EOP242}
[Kid]{1}"Huh? You mean me?"


97 :

{EOP243}
[Man]{1}"Yes. That's right..."

Running feet braked sharply beside him.

The guy was out of breath.


98 :

{EOP244}
[Man]{1}"Actually, I want to ask you something."


{EOP245}
[Kid]{1}"Huh?"

Surprised, he slowly opened his mouth.


99 :

{EOP246}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey, you don't know, do you?"

There was nothing to do but see where the{1}conversation went.


100 :

{EOP247}
[Takeshi]{1}"Sorry to ask you like this out of the blue, but{1}you don't know, do you?"


{EOP248}
[Takeshi]{1}"You haven't seen my friends around here, have{1}you?"


{EOP249}
[Takeshi]{1}"One of them is about 1.5 meters tall and around{1}60 kilograms. Kind of good-looking, with dorky{1}sunglasses, and probably not the type girls{1}would go for."


{EOP250}
[Takeshi]{1}"Another was wearing a suit, no tie, short hair,{1}and has three piercings in his ear and one in{1}his nose. He likes to knit..."


{EOP251}
[Takeshi]{1}"And then there was the only girl in the group,{1}who had on a kind of simple color flower print{1}one-piece with frilly lace..."


{EOP252}
[Takeshi]{1}"You know, three people you might see{1}anywhere..."


{EOP253}
[Takeshi]{1}"Did you see them?"


101 :

{EOP254}
[Kid]{1}"Nope."

The young kid shook his head.


{EOP255}
[Takeshi]{1}"I see. Well, sorry about stopping you like{1}that."


102 :
Waving slightly, he left.


103 :
The youth continued down the corridor ahead.


104 :
A girl came over to him and started talking to{1}him enthusiastically.

He thought he had seen her before.

(Huh... I wonder if she knows that kid.)


105 :
But a troubled expression appeared on his{1}face.


106 :

{EOP256}
[£o¢o]{1}"Hey, hey! Do you want to hear a joke?"


{EOP257}
[Kid]{1}"Huh? What? Who are you?"

(So that's it...)

She was probably one of those kinds of people{1}that would talk to anyone about anything{1}anywhere, whether they were interested or not.


107 :
He thought he would go down below.

The elevator arrived soundlessly and swallowed{1}the waiting patrons.

He went with them farther into the depths of{1}LeMU.


108 :
He walked around aimlessly.


109 :
The attractions were all packed with visitors.

Everyone had beaming smiles and yelled{1}happily‡Lall evidence of LeMU's popularity.

But still... Wandering around a packed and{1}lively amusement park all alone was a bit{1}tortuous.


He couldn't help trudging around with heavy feet{1}and slumped shoulders.

He was on the verge of looking depressed, but he{1}held his expression in check.


110 :

{EOP258}
[Takeshi]{1}"What am I gonna do?"

Walking around blindly in that place, he thought{1}he might never run into his friends.

The floor was a lot wider than he'd imagined.


{EOP259}
[Takeshi]{1}"Oh right, my cell phone..."

He took his PDA multi-purpose communication{1}device out from his pocket.

He pushed a button.

He didn't have any messages. No mail either. But{1}the problem seemed to be...

It was out of range.

At least that was what the display said.


{EOP260}
[Takeshi]{1}"Are you serious!?"


{EOP261}
[Takeshi]{1}"I didn't think you could get out of range in{1}this day and age..."

Then he recalled they'd said something about it{1}being a giant tunnel in the middle of the ocean{1}where only select radio waves could reach.

And that LeMU used special electronic equipment{1}which wasn't very compatible with mobile{1}equipment.

More than anything, they didn't allow PDAs to{1}work inside so the facility would be completely{1}separated from the world above as part of the{1}attraction.

...At least that was what they'd told him at the{1}entrance, but he hadn't listened to a word of{1}it.


111 :
(Maybe I should get them to broadcast a message{1}over the intercom...?)

He thought it might be best to just ask a staff{1}member.

He decided to look for one.

But there wasn't a uniformed person in sight.

There weren't many people walking around the{1}corridors either.


112 :
He turned a corner and entered a completely{1}different corridor.


113 :
There, right in front of him, was the giant{1}tanuki...

It was the one he'd seen at the gate while{1}coming in...

The tanuki was operating a panel on the{1}wall...


(I'll bet that's a LeMU employee.)

Thinking it perfect timing, he saddled up to the{1}tanuki and called out.


{EOP262}
[Takeshi]{1}"Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. A{1}friend."


{EOP263}
[Takeshi]{1}"Could I get you to make an announcement over{1}the intercom or something? The name is...{1}Uh..."


114 :
The tanuki slowly turned around and looked at{1}him.

[Tanuki]{1}"............"

But it didn't say anything.


{EOP264}
[Takeshi]{1}"Uh? Hello? Hello?"


115 :
The tanuki turned away, avoiding him.

He was being ignored.

(I wonder if it didn't hear me.)

The tanuki was wearing a big stuffed suit and{1}was a full head taller than him.

There was the definite possibility that his{1}words weren't even reaching the ears inside.


116 :

{EOP265}
[Takeshi]{1}"HELLOOOooo. Can you hear me in there?"

He asked the question nicely as he poked the{1}tanuki in the ribs.


{EOP266}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey, you've gotta lot of extra flesh here,{1}buddy."

He continued talking as he pinched, pulled, and{1}released the tanuki's flank.


117 :
He thought that for a mascot suit, the tanuki{1}shot him a pretty realistic glare before it{1}turned to walk away.

Upset at that, he grabbed the tanuki's{1}shoulder.


{EOP267}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey! What kind of an attitude is that? And when{1}a visitor's in trouble!"


118 :
Whump!


119 :

{EOP268}
[Takeshi]{1}"Umpph!"


{EOP269}
[Takeshi]{1}"~~~~~~!?"


120 :
He'd been gut-punched.

The tanuki had actually slugged him.

Not even his parents had ever even really{1}spanked him before.

It had been a totally cheap shot‡Lthe tanuki had{1}landed a solid uppercut.


{EOP270}
[Takeshi]{1}"H-hey...! Tanuki...! Yeah, I mean you!"

[Tanuki]{1}"........."

He went down on his knees and keeled over.

Nearby visitors reacted.


{EOP271}
[Park staff]{1}"Is everything alright?"


121 :
Just then, a park employee appeared from the{1}door.


{EOP272}
[Park staff]{1}"Are you having stomach pains?"


122 :
{11:0-02}
{11:1}It was the tanuki

{11:1}Forget it


123 :

{EOP273}
[Takeshi]{1}"...That tanuki caught me with a body blow..."


124 :

{EOP274}
[Park staff]{1}"Huh?"

The employee gave him a surprised look.


{EOP275}
[Takeshi]{1}"I got sucker punched by that tanuki!"

He pointed at the big tanuki.

[Tanuki]{1}"........."

The tanuki's expression didn't change.


125 :
But it turned and started to run.


126 :
The tanuki's silhouette pranced lightly away{1}into the distance.


127 :
And in an instant, it had disappeared down the{1}walkway.

[Takeshi]{1}"........."


128 :
[Park staff]{1}"........."


129 :

{EOP276}
[Park staff]{1}"Uh, that is, um, a..."

The staff member looked after the tanuki as she{1}spoke.


{EOP277}
[Park staff]{1}"That's not a tanuki, that's a lemur."


{EOP278}
[Takeshi]{1}"Le-lemu... What?"

He rubbed his still-aching stomach as he{1}spoke.


130 :

{EOP279}
[Park staff]{1}"Yes. A lemur. You know, a fox-like monkey."


{EOP280}
[Park staff]{1}"Its name is Myumyun."


131 :
LeMU had been named after the continent of{1}Lemuria.

A legendary land.

According to the British zoologist Sclater, the{1}Lemurian continent preceded the existence of{1}islands scattered throughout the Indian Ocean.

{16:4}

132 :
Lemurs were scattered throughout Africa, the{1}island of Madagascar, Asia, and Indonesia.

While investigating the distribution of those{1}fox-monkeys, Sclater came to believe a continent{1}had existed in the Indian Ocean, adopting the{1}British geologist Brandford's hypothesis.



{1}He named that continent Lemuria.

Moreover, the German zoologist Haeckel contended{1}that the continent was the origin of mankind.

{16:4}

133 :

{EOP281}
[Park staff]{1}"Myumyun is one of LeMU's mascots."


134 :

{EOP282}
[Park staff]{1}"But what happened? Are you ill? Or..."


{EOP283}
[Takeshi]{1}"No. I'm fine now. Don't worry about me..."


{EOP284}
[Takeshi]{1}"It's over anyway."


135 :

{EOP285}
[Park staff]{1}"Oh, I see..."


136 :

{EOP286}
[Takeshi]{1}"It's nothing. I just took a tumble."


137 :

{EOP287}
[Park staff]{1}"Is that so?"

He couldn't bring himself to say that the tanuki{1}had floored him with one punch...

[Tanuki]{1}"........."


138 :
The big tanuki turned its back and ran.


139 :
The tanuki's silhouette pranced lightly away{1}into the distance.


140 :
A moment later, it had disappeared up the{1}hallway ahead.


141 :

{EOP288}
[Park staff]{1}"Oh. I wonder what happened to that Myumyun."

The staff member looked after the tanuki as she{1}spoke.


{EOP289}
[Park staff]{1}"You're probably thinking I should be getting{1}back to my post, right...? Oh well."


142 :
She looked at him again and smiled, laughing.


{EOP290}
[Park staff]{1}"If you need anything, don't hesitate to{1}call."


143 :
The staff member disappeared.

(I see...)

(That wasn't a tanuki, that was 'Myumyun'.)


144 :
He wasn't sure why Myumyun had hauled off and{1}punched him.

But he knew that wondering about it wouldn't{1}help.

So he decided to forget about it.

He needed to be getting somewhere.


{EOP291}
[Takeshi]{1}"I'll look around on my own a little more..."

He muttered that as he composed himself.

He knew there should be several attractions at{1}the other end of the corridor.

His friends might have been looking for him as{1}they waited in line.


{EOP292}
[Takeshi]{1}"So which way should I go?"

His legs were so tired that he could barely{1}move.

(This is...)

(The world's worst theme park...)

And that was exactly how he felt.


145 :

{EOP293}
[Kid]{1}"Oh well..."

Hit by a slight dizzy spell, he leaned against{1}the wall.


{EOP294}
[Kid]{1}"What in the world...?"

He sighed.

He was fully and utterly beat.

The staff member that had just been talking to{1}him had vanished somewhere.

Y¤u wasn't around either.

He had lost sight of the other girl as well.

He was alone again.


{EOP295}
[Kid]{1}"What did I come here for? I..."


146 :
He thought that maybe he should have waited{1}where he was before after all.

Having lost his destination, he rode the{1}elevator from the aquarium and returned to{1}basement floor two.


147 :
Basement floor two‡LZweiter Stock.

(The second floor...?)

(I screwed up...)

(The rest area is down one more level.)

He felt like he had come a long way from the{1}elevator room.

He didn't know which path he should take to go{1}down.

Which way...


148 :

{EOP296}
[???]{1}"Could you come here for a moment?"

A voice called to him from somewhere.

From somewhere...


{EOP297}
[Kid]{1}"!?"

From the shadows of the path, the owner of the{1}voice was beckoning to him.

But the hand did not belong to a human.


149 :

{EOP298}
[???]{1}"Look, hurry up, will you?"

It was the whispering voice of a young woman.

Her bulky, black arm was swaying rhythmically.

Disturbed by the difference between the voice{1}and its owner's appearance, he moved,{1}hypnotized, in its direction.

The hand and arm clearly belonged to a tanuki.

It was a big tanuki.


150 :

{EOP299}
[Tanuki]{1}"Do you know where we are?"

He was led by the tanuki into a room at the end{1}of the walkway.

Or rather... Packed into it.


{EOP300}
[Kid]{1}"This is..."

(Is this the girl's changing room...?)

He saw a uniform, like the one Y¤u had been{1}wearing, packed away inside an open locker.

(Hey... I can even see some women's{1}underwear...)


The room smelled like perfume.

The air was saturated with a scent so strong it{1}almost made him choke.

The smell was about to overwhelm him.

He struggled to get his mind under control and{1}maintain his focus.


151 :

{EOP301}
[Tanuki]{1}"Hey, do you know where we are?"

The tanuki asked the same question again.

Come to think of it... why was she a tanuki{1}anyway?

He had no clue.


{EOP302}
[Kid]{1}"This..."


{EOP303}
[Tanuki]{1}"...Is the changing room."

She said that before he could answer.


{EOP304}
[Tanuki]{1}"Changing rooms are..."


{EOP305}
[Tanuki]{1}"A place to keep secrets away from prying{1}eyes..."

She said that quietly.


{EOP306}
[Kid]{1}"Secrets?"


152 :
Wham!

Suddenly, his vision faded.

Everything went completely dark.


{EOP307}
[Kid]{1}"Huh?"


{EOP308}
[Tanuki]{1}"Will you look after this for me?"


{EOP309}
[Kid]{1}"Huh? What? What?"

Look after?

He didn't understand.


{EOP310}
[Tanuki]{1}"Here, I'll help you put it on right."


{EOP311}
[Kid]{1}"Uh, um..."

Wear it?

He had no idea what she was talking about.


{EOP312}
[Kid]{1}"Uh, wuh, whoa..."

He didn't understand why, but he couldn't{1}move.


He was powerless to resist her, and he let her{1}do what she wanted.

In a moment, something completely covered his{1}body.

[Kid]{1}"........."


{EOP313}
[Tanuki]{1}"Heehee. This should do it..."


{EOP314}
[Tanuki]{1}"Alright then. I'll leave the rest to you."

And the light sound of her footsteps faded into{1}the distance.


153 :
The last thing he heard was the click of a door{1}shutting...

[Kid]{1}"........."

He heard the sound.

But he did not see her leave.


{EOP315}
[Kid]{1}".........?"

(What did she do to me?)


His face felt heavy...

His body felt heavy...

He had tunnel vision...

And for some reason, his body was bristling with{1}hair...

(Could it be...)

(That this is... the mascot outfit...)

When he shook his head, it made a sound like{1}bristles brushing something.

And there was a smell.

There was some other scent from inside the{1}costume.

A sweet smell that made him dizzy.

It pierced deep into his brain...

Before he knew what was going on, he had opened{1}the door and was shuffling out into the{1}pathway.


154 :

{EOP316}
[Takeshi]{1}"Ahh!"

Without thinking, he let out a cry.

He had found it.

(It's that tanuki...)


155 :
He had just been told that it was not a tanuki,{1}but Myumyun the fox-monkey; that information had{1}already disappeared from his mind.


156 :
He had just heard that it was not a tanuki, but{1}Myumyun the fox-monkey; that information had{1}already disappeared from his mind.


157 :
(I forgot its name...)

(It doesn't matter, though. That's the person{1}that hit me and ran away.)

He didn't want revenge...

But he did want to ask it why it had done what{1}it did.


158 :
Without making a sound, he slowly approached the{1}tanuki‡Lmascot‡LMyumyun.


159 :
And as soon as he got behind it, he quickly{1}grabbed the costume by the head.


160 :
There!


{EOP317}
[Kid]{1}"Who... Who're you?"


{EOP318}
[Takeshi]{1}"I should be asking you that!"


{EOP319}
[Takeshi]{1}"Why would you do something like that!?"


{EOP320}
[Kid]{1}"Huh? What'd I do?"


{EOP321}
[Takeshi]{1}"Don't play dumb with me."


{EOP322}
[Kid]{1}"I have no idea what you're talking about..."


{EOP323}
[Takeshi]{1}"You... You hit me!"


{EOP324}
[Kid]{1}"No I didn't! I have no idea what you mean!"


{EOP325}
[Takeshi]{1}"Liar! What? Did you forget?"


{EOP326}
[Kid]{1}"I'm not lying. This girl..."


{EOP327}
[Kid]{1}"Gave me this outfit out of nowhere and..."


{EOP328}
[Takeshi]{1}"What? You just met her? When did you change?"


{EOP329}
[Kid]{1}"I just put it on. I..."


{EOP330}
[Takeshi]{1}"Just put it on? What are you talking about?"


{EOP331}
[Kid]{1}"But why do this..."


{EOP332}
[Kid]{1}"This..."


161 :
At that point, the tanuki collapsed.

He collapsed in full Myumyun regalia.


162 :

{EOP333}
[Takeshi]{1}"Wh-what? Hey!"

Takeshi shook his shoulders, but there was no{1}response.


{EOP334}
[Takeshi]{1}"Somebody come quick! Something's not right{1}here."

He yelled.

Visitors watched from a distance.


163 :

{EOP335}
[Park staff]{1}"What's the matter?"

A female employee had heard the fuss and came{1}running.


{EOP336}
[Takeshi]{1}"Huh? You're that girl from before... This guy{1}just collapsed all of a sudden."


164 :

{EOP337}
[Park staff]{1}"Let me see!"


165 :
The employee took the pulse of the fallen{1}youth.

Takeshi wondered if she had any medical{1}knowledge.


166 :

{EOP338}
[Park staff]{1}"He's alright... but we can't leave him here{1}like this."


{EOP339}
[Takeshi]{1}"I'll help."


{EOP340}
[Park staff]{1}"Great, thanks."


167 :
Why had such a thing happened?

He had no idea.

No idea...

Where he was.

Where he had gone.

Shaking.

Shaken.

Feeling ill.

He could feel hair from the costume rubbing{1}along both of his sides as two people carried{1}him.

Rubbing...

He wished they'd get the mascot suit off him{1}quickly.

The fur felt nasty.

It was hot.

So hot.

So hot he couldn't stand it.

The heat made him feel faint.

His consciousness felt like it would drift{1}away.


Why had such a thing happened?

It was strange.

So strange...

It wasn't him or her.

He heard a different voice from somewhere...


168 :
He had been hauled to the infirmary.


169 :

{EOP341}
[Park staff]{1}"I wonder what it could be? Is he anemic?"


{EOP342}
[Takeshi]{1}"Maybe it was the mascot suit? Maybe he couldn't{1}get used to wearing it."


{EOP343}
[Park staff]{1}"It's possible. It could be heat{1}exhaustion..."


{EOP344}
[Takeshi]{1}"Does... it look like he'll be okay?"


170 :

{EOP345}
[Park staff]{1}"It doesn't appear to be anything serious. A{1}little rest and he should be fine."


{EOP346}
[Takeshi]{1}"I see."


{EOP347}
[Park staff]{1}"Thanks for your help. I'll take it from{1}here."


{EOP348}
[Takeshi]{1}"Oh, alright then."


171 :
He opened the sliding door and left the room.


172 :

{EOP349}
[Takeshi]{1}"Whew... Saving people can sure be stressful."


{EOP350}
[Takeshi]{1}"What was it I came here to do?"

A cool breeze was blowing along the walkway.


173 :
Breeze...

But where was it coming from?

He...

He wondered where he had come from.


174 :
He saw something faintly.

A ceiling.

Sheets.

A bed...

He had been put to sleep on a bed.

On a bed in the infirmary...

He saw something again.

Below the sick room... bed...


175 :
Who was on the bed below?

(Who is this?)

(This...)

(This isn't me...)

(...Of course not...)


176 :
He decided to go farther down the hall.

The third floor underground‡Lthey had called it{1}Dritter Stock...

(The guys... They've gotta be lined up waiting{1}for a crowded ride somewhere.)


177 :

{EOP351}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey, sorry! I'm getting in!"

He dashed into the elevator.

The doors reopened silently and closed again.


178 :
(Huh?)

One other person had gotten on.

A girl.

A girl...

(More like a young woman, I guess.)

One girl had gotten on.

She was about high school age.

The elevator floated upward an instant before{1}descending.

There was the faint sound of movement and{1}vibration.


179 :
And then his eyes met with the girl's.

He wondered why...

The girl stared at him suspiciously.


{EOP352}
[Girl]{1}"...What?"


{EOP353}
[Girl]{1}"Just who are you...?"


{EOP354}
[Girl]{1}"Why are you here?"


{EOP355}
[Girl]{1}"Why are you following me...?"


180 :
{11:0-04}
{11:1}Apologize

{11:1}Just who exactly are you?

{11:1}Stay silent


181 :

{EOP356}
[Takeshi]{1}"I'm sorry."

He didn't recall seeing her, but he nodded{1}slightly in apology.


{EOP357}
[Takeshi]{1}"Did I do something to offend you?"


182 :

{EOP358}
[Girl]{1}"...Not really..."


{EOP359}
[Takeshi]{1}".........?"

He was getting more and more confused.

[Girl]{1}"........."


{EOP360}
[Girl]{1}"...I mean..."


{EOP361}
[Girl]{1}"This elevator is... for employees only."


{EOP362}
[Takeshi]{1}"Oh, I see."


183 :

{EOP363}
[Takeshi]{1}"Just who exactly are you?"


{EOP364}
[Takeshi]{1}"Did I do something wrong?"


{EOP365}
[Girl]{1}"Yes, you did. Just now..."


{EOP366}
[Takeshi]{1}"Just now?"

He was getting more and more confused.


184 :
[Girl]{1}"........."


{EOP367}
[Girl]{1}"I mean..."


{EOP368}
[Girl]{1}"I don't... want you to get in the way, that's{1}all."


{EOP369}
[Takeshi]{1}"Get in the way of what?"


185 :
[Takeshi]{1}"........."

[Girl]{1}"........."


186 :
She avoided his eyes.

[Takeshi]{1}"........."

[Girl]{1}"........."

He felt like the air around him had suddenly{1}gotten much heavier.


187 :
‡LBoom!


188 :
Jolting suddenly, the elevator stopped.


189 :
He looked at the ceiling.

The lights flickered unsteadily.


{EOP370}
[Takeshi]{1}"Wh-what was that!?"


{EOP371}
[Girl]{1}"It couldn't be..."


{EOP372}
[Takeshi]{1}"Couldn't be? Couldn't be what?"


190 :
Couldn't be?

He wondered if something had gone terribly{1}wrong.

It was strange.

Very strange...


191 :
(Who's this?)

(Oh, it's her.)

(We've finally met...)

(I've been looking for you this whole time...)

But his voice didn't reach her.

‡L‡L‡L‡L,‡L‡L‡L‡L

‡L‡L‡L‡L

‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L‡L

He couldn't hear her voice either.

No matter how much he tried...

No sounds reached him.

(Damn... What's going on...?)


192 :
But he faintly saw a figure.

He was able to make sure.

He could see himself and the girl talking over{1}there.

He saw it on the other side...

(I...)

(I can see myself over there...?)

He watched.

And he watched.


193 :
(That's strange...)

(No... It's odd...)

(If I'm watching them, then who is the 'me'{1}watching me?)

Something felt out of place.

He knew the truth, and his lips trembled.

(Who is that...?)

(Who could the 'me' over there be?)

He couldn't shake the feeling that something was{1}wrong.

It was like a dream.

It was like he was watching the continuation of{1}a dream.


194 :
But a dream couldn't have felt so powerfully{1}raw.

All of the screaming.

And the sound of running feet.

The shrill wailing of sirens.

That wasn't a dream or an illusion.


195 :

{EOP373}
[Takeshi]{1}"Couldn't be? Do you know something about{1}this?"


{EOP374}
[Girl]{1}"I don't know anything..."


{EOP375}
[Girl]{1}"Do you know something?"


{EOP376}
[Takeshi]{1}"How could I know anything?"

The lights gradually dimmed and finally went{1}out.


196 :
Why?

He had no idea.

He didn't know...

There was no way he could know.


197 :
But there on the bed.

There...

On the bed...

There...


198 :
The bed below, the bed on top, the bed{1}below...


Who are...

(You...?)

Who...?

(Stop...)

Please stop.

(Don't come out...)

Please don't come out.

(Stay inside...)

Don't crawl out of there.

(Stop... Plea...)

S-st... sto... stop...


199 :
No...

There was nothing to fear.

It was alright.

Because there was no longer anyone.

Because there was no one there.


200 :

{EOP377}
[Takeshi]{1}"Hey! Who's there? Is there somebody there?"


{EOP378}
[Takeshi]{1}"I'm here! I'm still in here!"


{EOP379}
[Takeshi]{1}"Somebody, get me out of here!"


{EOP380}
[Takeshi]{1}"Answer me... Please..."


201 :

{EOP381}
[Kid]{1}"Isn't there anyone there?"

Nobody answered.

The surroundings were filled with silence.


{EOP382}
[Kid]{1}"What? Is anybody there?"


{EOP383}
[Kid]{1}"So I'm alone... Heeheehee."

He burst with laughter.

The ultimate feeling of liberation.

There was no one to restrain him anymore.


{EOP384}
[Kid]{1}"Ahahaha!"


202 :
And he ran.

But no one stopped him.

Getting there was easy.

All that was left was to aim for the 'center'.

Just take a step.

It was simple.


203 :
He threw his body into the water.

He sank.


204 :
Deeper, deeper, and deeper...


205 :
Sound died away.

The embrace of unbelievably pure silence.

Not even a beam of light pierced the darkness.

All he could hear was repetitive heavy{1}breathing.


206 :
He lost himself, his mind short-circuiting.

His vision narrowed and was overrun with blue.

Deep blue.

Blue...

Something was strange...

He wondered if it really was blue.


207 :
Even though he was perfectly still, it seemed as{1}if his heart was racing.

Sweat poured off of him.

His breathing was ragged and labored.


208 :
Gradually, his consciousness dissolved into the{1}darkness.

Black.

Endless black.

There was no mistaking it this time...

Everything was stained black.

There were no boundaries to the color.


209 :
His ears hurt. The ringing in them wouldn't{1}stop.

He felt pressure expanding in his lungs.

He felt queasy, sick to his stomach.


{EOP385}
[Girl]{1}"The air pressure... is dropping..."

(I forgot... I need to pop my ears...)

With a pop, the air building inside his ears was{1}released.


{EOP386}
[Takeshi]{1}"Damn..."


{EOP387}
[Takeshi]{1}"Which way is the exit...?"


210 :
‡LPitch black.

Nothing moved.

He didn't move either.

There wasn't any sign of a breeze.

He didn't hear anything.

Just echoes from something invisible.

Time froze to a stop.

If he stopped there, he felt like he would{1}forget that he was even alive.

It was his intuition.

Only a little more...

No!

It was no good.

He had to get out.

But he didn't even know which direction to go.

He had to get... himself out of the darkness...{1}Had to...

But what could he do?

What could...

He didn't know.

He didn't know...

...


211 :
Just then, he felt a faint, warm light.

Light...?

A blade of light slicing through the flat world{1}of darkness.

And he knew...

The direction was over there...

And that there might be a way out...

If he could get over there...


212 :
{11:0-07}
{11:1}I've got to find my friends...

{11:1}Who am I?


213 :
I've got to find them.

I quietly

opened the door.


214 :
I didn't know where I was, but I

quietly

opened my eyes.
